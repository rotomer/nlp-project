ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary The following table highlights summarized components of our condensed consolidated summary of operations for the years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and December 31, 2006. For the Years Ended December 28, 2008 % change December 30, 2007 % change December 31, 2006(1)(2) (Volumes in thousands, dollars in millions, except percentages and per share data) Volume in barrels 29,656 (29.0 )% 41,796 (0.0 )% 41,806 Net sales $ 4,774.3 (22.9 )% $ 6,190.6 5.9 % $ 5,845.0 Income from continuing operations $ 400.1 (22.3 )% $ 514.9 37.8 % $ 373.6 Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ 2.16 (23.9 )% $ 2.84 31.5 % $ 2.16 (1)Per share amounts have been adjusted from previously reported amounts for the effect of our 2 for 1 stock split issued in the form of a stock dividend on October 3, 2007. (2)The 53rd week in our fiscal 2006 increased total company sales volume by approximately 600,000 barrels and increased reported pre tax profit of $472.1 million by approximately $6 million. 32 Table of Contents The following table highlights summarized components of our sales volume for the years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 (actual and pro forma) and December 31, 2006. For the years ended December 28, 2008 December 30, 2007 December 30, 2007 December 31, 2006 Actual Pro forma(1) Actual Actual Volume in U.S. barrels (in thousands): Financial volume 29,656 29,439 41,796 41,806 Royalty volume 256 214 214 124 Owned volume 29,912 29,653 42,010 41,930 Proportionate share of equity investment sales to retail(2) 13,781 13,868 Total worldwide beer volume 43,693 43,521 42,010 41,930 (1)Reflects the exclusion of the U.S. segment volume reported for the twenty six weeks ended December 31, 2007. (2)Reflects the addition of MCBCs proportionate share of MillerCoors and Molson Modelo sales to retail for the periods presented, adjusted for comparable trading days, including on a pro forma basis for the twenty six weeks ended December 31, 2007. Worldwide beer volume is composed of our financial volume, royalty volume and proportionate share of equity investment sales to retail. Financial volume represents owned beer brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographical markets. Royalty beer volume consists of product produced and sold by third parties under various license and contract brewing agreements. Equity investment sales to retail brands volume represents the companys ownership percentage share of volume in its subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method, including MillerCoors and Modelo Molson Imports, L.P. 2008 Key Financial Highlights: Our performance in 2008 demonstrated that our brand growth strategies and cost reduction efforts continue to strengthen our competitive capabilities and financial performance. We achieved a few highlights from a year full of challenges but also transformation and progress for our company. The following are several critical successes in 2008: We made great progress on brand building, front line pricing and cost reductions, however we were challenged by commodity inflation, weak industry volume in key markets, and unfavorable foreign currency toward the end of the year. The completion of MillerCoors in the U.S. led our transformational moves, and integration is progressing well. In Canada, we grew net pricing based on the strength of our strategic brand portfolio and secured the opportunity to grow the Modelo brands across Canada for the long term. In the U.K., we grew net pricing for the year, launched Magners draught cider, and began implementing a contract brewing arrangement that will be beneficial for years to come. Globally, we exceeded all of our cost savings goals, 33 Table of Contents appropriately funded our pensions and reduced the future size and volatility of our pension liabilities, created a stronger Global Market Development organization, and reduced interest and corporate overhead expenses. Synergies and other cost savings initiatives For the full year, we achieved $87 million of savings, which exceeded our 2008 goal by $10 million. These cost reductions include our 42% share of Resources for Growth ("RFG") cost savings initiatives that were carried forward by MillerCoors in the back half of 2008. The benefit MillerCoors cost savings will generate, which we expect to realize through higher income from the joint venture, which are in addition to the $500 million of committed MillerCoors cost synergies, will enable us to deliver on our overall commitment to cost savings initiatives. Our share of these assumed RFG savings was $6 million in the second half. For the entire RFG program, which began in 2007, we have now delivered $178 million of our total projected $250 million in savings. MillerCoors is progressing towards its stated goal of $500 million of synergies in the first three years of combined operations. Since combining operations, MillerCoors has delivered $28 million in synergies. The timing to achieve MillerCoors original goal of $50 million in synergies in the first twelve months of operations has accelerated, and MillerCoors now expects to realize $128 million of synergies by June 30, 2009. By the end of calendar year 2009, MillerCoors expects to achieve a total of $238 million in synergies surpassing its original forecast of $225 million. While the timing of synergy delivery has accelerated, MillerCoors goal remains $500 million in three years. Components of our Statement of Operations Net sales Our net sales represent almost exclusively the sale of beer and other malt beverages, the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell certain non owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. We also sell certain "factored" brands, as a distributor, to on premise customers in the United Kingdom. Cost of goods sold Our cost of goods sold includes costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials, such as barley, hops, various grains and other key brewing materials purchased. Packaging materials, including costs for glass bottles, aluminum and steel cans, cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold also include both direct and indirect labor, freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, depreciation, and other manufacturing overheads, as well as the cost to purchaser of "factored" brands from suppliers. Marketing, general and administrative These costs include media advertising (television, radio, print), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point of sale materials) and promotion costs planned and executed on both local and national levels within our operating segments. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations, including labor and other overheads. This classification also include general and administrative costs for functions such as finance, legal, human resources and information technology, which consist primarily of labor and outside services. Last, this line item includes amortization costs associated with intangible assets, as well as certain depreciation costs related to non production equipment. Special Items These are infrequent and or unusual items which affect our statement of operations, and are discussed in each segments Results of Operations discussion. Equity income in MillerCoors This item represents our proportionate share for the period of the undistributed net income (loss) of our investment in MillerCoors accounted for under the equity method. Such amount typically reflects adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated 34 Table of Contents statements, including adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses, and to amortize, if appropriate, any difference between cost and underlying equity in net assets upon the formation of MillerCoors. Interest expense, net Interest costs associated with borrowings to finance our operations are classified here. Interest income in the U.K. segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers. Debt extinguishment costs The costs are associated with payments to settle the notes at fair value given interest rates at the time of extinguishment, incentive payments to note holders for early tendering of the notes, and a write off of the proportionate amount of unamortized discount and issuance fees associated with the extinguished debt. Other income (expense) This classification includes primarily gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. For instance, gains or losses on sales of non operating assets, our share of income or loss associated with our ownership in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens hockey club, and certain foreign exchange gains and losses are classified here. Discussions of statement of operations line items such as minority interests and discontinued operations are discussed in detail elsewhere in MD&A and in the Notes to Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. Depreciation Depreciation and amortization expense decreased from 2008 versus 2007 excluding special items, as a result of the formation of MillerCoors. There were no other material factors contributing to the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as experienced in 2007. We realized a 6% decrease related to depreciation and amortization expense of assets in 2007 versus 2006 excluding special items, due to the net effect of five factors: We evaluated the estimated useful lives of a substantial portion of our property, plant and equipment on a global basis, in light of improvements in maintenance, new technology and changes in expected patterns of usage. The lengthening of certain depreciable asset lives as a result of this evaluation resulted in a reduction of our consolidated depreciation expense for the full year 2007. Substantial existing assets became fully depreciated, so expense related to these assets was significantly lower in 2007 than 2006. Adding packaging capacity in our Toronto and Shenandoah facilities during 2006 and brewing capacity in our Shenandoah facility in the first half of 2007. Installing cold dispense units in pubs and restaurants in the U.K. resulted in a year over year increase. Purchase of the keg population in the U.K. increased depreciation in the Europe segment. Income Taxes Our full year effective tax rates were approximately 20%, 1% and 17% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our 2008, 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates were significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following factors, lower effective income tax rates applicable to our Canadian and U.K. businesses, and one time benefits from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to give effect to reductions in foreign income tax rates and tax law changes. 35  Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The Companys former Brazil business, Kaiser, is reported as a discontinued operation due to the sale of an 83% controlling interest in the business in 2006. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 4 "DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The loss from discontinued operations of $12.1 million for the year ended 2008 is associated with adjustments to the indemnity liabilities due to changes in estimates and foreign exchange losses. The net loss from discontinued operations of $17.7 million for the year ended 2007 is composed of the following components: A net loss of $20.4 million associated with adjustments to the indemnity liabilities due to changes in estimates and foreign exchange losses. A gain of $2.7 million due to an income tax adjustment related to the sale of Kaiser. In conjunction with this transaction, the purchaser (FEMSA) assumed $63 million of financial debt and assumed contingent liabilities of approximately $260 million, related primarily to tax claims, subject to our indemnification. As a result, we have a level of continuing potential exposure to these contingent liabilities of Kaiser, as well as previously disclosed but less than probable unaccrued claims. While we believe that all significant contingencies were disclosed as part of the sale process and adequately reserved for on Kaisers financial statements, resolution of contingencies and claims above reserved or otherwise disclosed amounts could, under some circumstances, result in additional cash outflows for Molson Coors because of transaction related indemnity provisions. We have recorded these indemnity liabilities at fair value and have a carrying value at December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, of $133.2 million and $155.0 million, respectively. Due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, there could be significant adjustments in the future. Results of Operations Canada Segment Our Canada segment consists primarily of Molsons beer business, including the production and sale of the Molson brands, Coors Light and other licensed brands, in Canada. Effective, January 1, 2008, Molson and Grupo Modelo, S.A.B. de C.V. established a joint venture, Modelo Molson Imports, L.P. ("MMI"), to import, distribute, and market the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories. Under this arrangement, Molsons sales teams are responsible for promoting and selling the brands across Canada on behalf of the joint venture. The alliance will enable Grupo Modelo to effectively utilize the resources and capabilities of Molson to achieve greater distribution coverage in the Western provinces of Canada. The MMI joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. The Canada segment also includes our arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario and the Western provinces, through Brewers Retail, Inc. ("BRI") a consolidated joint venture, and Brewers Distributor Ltd. ("BDL") a joint venture accounted for under the equity method. 36 Table of Contents See "Outlook for 2009" for discussion of forward looking trends regarding the Canada segment.

(2)Volumes represent net sales of MCBC owned brands and partner brands. Foreign currency impact on results Our Canada segment (as stated in USD) was unfavorably impacted by a 0.5% year over year decrease in the value of the CAD against the USD in 2008 versus 2007. The Canada segment benefited from a 7% year over year increase in the value of CAD against USD in 2007 versus 2006. Volume and net sales With the completion of the MillerCoors joint venture, our net sales and cost of goods sold related to products sold by Molson in Canada for U.S. distribution, which were previously treated as inter company transactions and eliminated upon consolidation, are now included in Canada segment results. The sales volume continues to be excluded from our Canada results, as this volume is reported by MillerCoors. This reporting had the effect of increasing net sales per barrel by approximately 5% to 6% and increasing cost of goods sold per barrel approximately 9% to 10% in the third and fourth quarter 2008, with minimal impact on gross profit. For the fifty two weeks ended December 28 2008, sales volume in Canada decreased by 4.4% to 7.6 million barrels versus prior year volume of 7.9 million barrels for the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2007. This decline is entirely the result of excluding our reported Modelo volumes in 2008 with the creation of our joint venture. Excluding this factor, full year sales volume of 7.6 million barrels increased 0.1% on a comparable basis versus prior year. Our Canada comparable sales to retail ("STRs") for 2008 increased 0.8% versus the prior calendar year driven by mid single digit growth of our strategic brands lead by Coors Light and Carling, which experienced double digit growth compared to the prior year. In addition, the Rickards and Creemore brands, as well as our partner import brands, all grew at high single digit rates on a full year basis. These increases were partially offset by declines in non strategic brands and other premium brands. Canada industry volumes grew an estimated 1.1% in 2008 compared to the prior calendar year. As a result, Molson experienced a slight market share decrease on a full year comparable basis. This 37 Table of Contents decrease was driven by softness in the Qu&eacute;bec market, partially offset by strong performance in the Ontario and Atlantic markets. On a full year basis, 2008 net sales revenue declined $48.9 million or 2.6% versus prior year. For the full year 2008, net sales revenue was $246.84 per barrel, an increase of 1.9% over 2007 net sales revenue of $242.15 per barrel. Excluding the effects of a U.S. production contract with Fosters that was terminated in the fourth quarter 2007, the Modelo Molson joint venture and the impact of sales to MillerCoors as disclosed above, net sales per barrel increased 2.3% as a result of higher net pricing and favorable sales mix of our products, including sales increases of our higher revenue per barrel partner import brands. For the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2007, sales volume in Canada decreased by 0.6% to 7.9 million barrels versus prior year volume of 7.95 million barrels for the fifty three weeks ended December 31, 2006. Excluding the effects associated with the change in the volume reporting policy, sales volume for 2007 of 8.2 million barrels decreased 1.6% versus prior year volume of 8.3 million barrels for the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2006. The 53rd week in 2006 delivered approximately 130,000 barrels, accounting for all of the year over year decrease. In addition, the termination of the Fosters U.S. production contract early in the fourth quarter 2007, drove a further sales volume reduction in 2007. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2006 and the volume reductions attributable to Fosters and other exported volume, comparable sales volume in Canada increased by approximately 1.5% or 110,000 barrels. Our Canada STRs for 2007 increased 1.0% versus the prior calendar year driven by mid single digit growth of our Molson strategic brands, lead by Coors Light, which experienced double digit growth compared to the prior year. In addition, the Rickards, Creemore and Carling brands, and our partner import brands, all grew at double digit rates on a full year basis. These increases were partially offset by declines in non strategic brands and other premium brands. Canada industry volumes grew an estimated 0.9% in 2007 compared to the prior calendar year. As a result, Molson experienced a slight market share increase on a full year basis, fueled by share growth over the key summer selling period and the strength of our strategic brands. On a full year basis, 2007 net sales revenue grew $119.6 million or 6.7% versus prior year with approximately 2% growth in local currency on a per barrel basis. For the full year 2007, net sales revenue was $242.15 per barrel, an increase of 7.3% over 2006 net sales revenue of $225.72 per barrel. Excluding the effects associated with the change in the volume reporting policy, net sales revenue was $234.66 per barrel, an increase of 8.4% over 2006 net sales revenue of $216.57. An approximate 7% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD during the year increased net sales revenue by approximately $114 million or $14.00 per barrel. Net pricing contributed half of the remaining increase with the year over year impact of modest general price increases being partially offset by increased price discounting in Qu&eacute;bec and Ontario. Improved sales mix from increased import sales, which are at higher than average retail prices, and decreased export sales, which are at lower than average retail prices, accounted for the remaining net increase. The decrease in export sales can be attributed to the termination of our Fosters US production contract in the fourth quarter of 2007. Cost of goods sold and gross profit Full year 2008 cost of goods sold per barrel increased 3.3% in local currency versus 2007. Excluding current year impacts of the termination of the Fosters contract, the changes associated with 38 Table of Contents MMI and sales to MillerCoors, cost of goods sold per barrel increased 7.4% on a comparable basis in local currency. The underlying cost of goods increase was due to the net effect of three factors: Higher commodity, packaging material and other input costs drove a 6% increase, combined with a 1% increase due to higher fuel and distribution costs, These inflationary increases were partially offset by a 2.5% decrease from our Resources for Growth cost savings initiatives, and Finally, an increase of about 3% was due to the ongoing shift in sales mix. For the full year 2007, cost of goods sold on a per barrel basis was $124.66 per barrel, an increase of 12.1% over 2006 cost of goods sold of $111.20 per barrel. Excluding the effects associated with the change in the volume reporting policy for the full year 2007, cost of goods sold on a per barrel basis was $120.81 per barrel, an increase of 13.2% over 2006 cost of goods sold of $106.70 per barrel. After adjusting for the approximate 7% appreciation in the value of CAD against USD, cost of goods sold increased by slightly less than 7% in 2007 in local currency. Inflationary cost increases across nearly all inputs drove approximately 3% of the increase in cost of goods sold per barrel, but was completely offset by the implementation of synergies and other cost savings initiatives in the year. The impacts of increased import sales, lower export sales due to the Fosters contract termination and non cash adjustments in both the current and prior years of certain foreign currency positions to their market values account for the increase in cost of goods sold per barrel. Marketing, general and administrative expenses For the full year, marketing, general and administrative expenses were $421.3 million, a decrease of $26.3 million or 5.9% lower versus prior year. In local currency total marketing, general, and administrative expenses decreased 7.3% versus the prior year driven by lower intangible amortization, combined with the elimination of all expenses associated with the Modelo brands, which are now managed by MMI. For the full year 2007, marketing, general and administrative expenses were $447.6 million, an increase of $7.7 million or 1.8% from 2006. In local currency, total marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by 4% driven by lower general and administrative costs through reduced intangible amortization expense and a focus on more efficient general and administrative spending, including lower employee costs and other cost savings. In addition, 2006 included certain nonrecurring costs including contract costs incurred to achieve longer term information technology synergies, and additional costs associated with the additional week in 2006 results. Promotional spending and brand investments were relatively flat in 2007 compared to the prior year. Special items, net The Canada segment recognized $10.9 million of special items expense during 2008. The special items represent costs associated with ongoing Edmonton brewery closing expenses, restructuring activities, and an asset impairment. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Canada segment recognized $75.2 million of special items expense during 2007. The special items represent $46.5 million relating to the Edmonton brewery closure, in which significant charges included a $31.9 million impairment charge on the carrying value of the fixed assets and an additional $14.6 million charge for severance and other costs associated with closing the brewery. Current plans are to demolish the building and sell the land, which has a carrying value of $10.1 million at December 30, 2007. Other charges include $24.1 million relating to the Fosters intangible asset impairment and $4.6 million relating to employee termination costs associated with production and sales, general and administrative functions. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, 39 Table of Contents Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other income (expense), net Other income in 2008 was $14.7 million lower than the prior year largely due to cycling the gain on the sale of our equity investment in the House of Blues Canada which resulted in an approximate $16.7 million income benefit in 2007. Other income in 2007 was $8.3 million higher than the prior year largely due to a gain on the sale of our equity investment in the House of Blues Canada which resulted in an approximate $16.7 million income benefit in the year. This was partially offset by the non recurrence of the approximate $9.0 million gain in 2006 from the reduction of guarantee liabilities related to our investment in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens hockey club in the prior year.  United States Segment During the first two quarters of 2008 and all of 2007 and 2006, the United States ("U.S.") segment produced, marketed and sold the Coors portfolio of leading beer brands in the United States and Puerto Rico and includes the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Corporation and Rocky Mountain Bottle Corporation, which are consolidated joint ventures. The U.S. segment also includes sales of Molson products in the United States. As of July 1, 2008, MillerCoors began operations. The results and financial position of our U.S. segment operations were prospectively deconsolidated upon contribution to the joint venture, and our interest in MillerCoors is being accounted for and reported by us under the equity method of accounting. MCBCs equity investment in MillerCoors will represent our U.S. operating segment going forward. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 1 "BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES" to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the MillerCoors joint venture. We review first below the results and financial position of our U.S. segment operations on an as reported basis, reflecting our operation of the segment for the first six months of 2008 and of the joint venture for the second six months of 2008, and then review the results and financial position of the U.S. segment on a pro forma basis for the six month period ended December 30, 2007. 40 Table of Contents See "Outlook for 2009" for discussion of forward looking trends regarding the United States segment.

(2)Volumes represent net sales of MCBC owned brands and partner brands. Our discussion of U.S. segment results of operations consists of two parts. A discussion of the first half of 2008 (prior to the formation of MillerCoors) versus the first half of 2007 is presented below, along with a discussion of results of 2007 versus 2006. A discussion of the last half of 2008 (after the formation of MillerCoors) is presented immediately afterward, with a comparison to the same period in 2007 on a pro forma basis. Before the formation of MillerCoors on July 1, 2008: Volume and net sales Sales volume to wholesalers increased by 7.2% in the first half of 2008 while STRs were up 5.7% during the same period, with Coors Light, Coors Banquet, Keystone Light and Blue Moon driving increased volume. Net sales per barrel increased by 3.8% in 2008, due to price increases and higher revenue from commercial can sales. Sales volume to wholesalers grew 3.3% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to strong STR growth, partially offset by a difference in the timing of our fiscal calendar. Our 50 states U.S. distributors STRs increased 4.6% and we continued to grow market share throughout 2007. This sales increase was driven by mid single digit growth for Coors Light, along with strong double digit growth of Blue Moon and low double digit growth of Keystone Light. Also Coors Banquet grew at a mid single digit rate on a year over year basis. Net sales per barrel increased 2.2% in 2007 due to higher base pricing and reduced discounting compared to the level of price promotion activity we experienced during 2006. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold per barrel increased by 3.4% in the first half of 2008. The year to date change is the result of higher commodity, transportation and packaging material costs partially offset by cost 41 Table of Contents savings initiatives. Cost savings initiatives, offset more than half of our U.S. inflation during the first half of 2008. Cost of goods sold increased marginally to $70.73 per barrel in 2007 versus $70.11 per barrel in 2006. The net increase in cost of goods sold was driven by an increase in commodity, transportation and packaging costs, more than 60% offset by our merger synergies and other operations cost reduction initiatives. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses were up 8.0% in the first half of 2008. Marketing investments increased at a low single digit rate, while general and administrative expenses grew at a low double digit rate due to the organization achieving our stock based long term incentive payout targets. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.9 million, or 1.3%, in 2007 versus 2006. Marketing investments decreased at a low single digit rate, while general and administrative expenses grew at a mid single digit rate due to higher employee incentive programs. Special items, net Special charges for the first half of 2008 were primarily a result of an impairment of an intangible asset associated with Molson brands sold in the U.S., and costs associated specifically with the MillerCoors transaction composed of employee retention and integration planning costs, partially offset by the net gain from the sale of the wholly owned distributor facilities in Boise, Idaho, and Glenwood Springs, Colorado. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" and Note 12 "GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We recognized $9.5 million of special charges in 2007 compared to $73.7 million of net special charges in 2006. In 2007, the special charges were related to employee retention costs in anticipation of the proposed MillerCoors joint venture and a newly initiated program focused on long term labor savings across the supply chain areas. Special items, net, in the U.S. segment in 2006 were associated primarily with the closure and sale of the Memphis brewery, completed in the third quarter of 2006. In 2006, we recorded approximately $60 million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets and impairments of fixed assets, reflecting their sales value, $12.5 million for accruals of severance and other costs associated with the plant closure, and a $3.1 million increase in the estimate of costs to withdraw from a multi employer pension plan benefiting former Memphis workers. Memphis related accelerated depreciation was higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to a lower sales price for the Memphis plant than our original estimate in 2005. The 2006 special items were partially offset by the receipt of a $2.4 million cash distribution from bankruptcy proceedings of a former insurance carrier for a claim related to our environmental obligations at the Lowry Superfund site in Denver, Colorado. We recorded the cash receipt as a special benefit consistent with the classification of the charge recorded in a previous year. The estimated environmental liability associated with this site was not impacted by the proceeds received. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other income (expense), net Other income was higher in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to a $1.9 million gain on the disposal of non operating long lived assets. 42 Table of Contents Other income was lower in 2007 versus 2006 primarily due to the recognition of a portion of a previously deferred gain on the sale of real estate. This amount was recognized in the second quarter of 2006 upon the satisfaction of certain conditions pertaining to the sale contract. After the formation of MillerCoors on July 1, 2008: The results of operations for MillerCoors for the six months ended December 28, 2008, and pro forma results of operations for the six month period ended December 30, 2007 are as follows: MillerCoors LLC Results of Operations For the six months ended December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 % change Actual Pro Forma (Volumes in thousands, dollars in millions, except percentages) Volumes 34,737 35,648 (2.6 )% Sales $ 4,329.4 $ 4,238.9 2.1 % Excise taxes (640.0 ) (643.6 ) (0.6 )% Net sales 3,689.4 3,595.3 2.6 % Cost of goods sold (2,326.0 ) (2,268.4 ) 2.5 % Gross profit 1,363.4 1,326.9 2.8 % Marketing, general and administrative expenses (1,032.4 ) (1,053.1 ) (2.0 )% Contract settlement 43.1 N/M Special items, net (103.8 ) (28.2 ) N/M Operating income 227.2 288.7 (21.3 )% Other income (expense), net 2.9 (0.1 ) N/M Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests 230.1 288.6 (20.3 )% Income tax expense (3.3 ) N/M Income from continuing operations before minority interests 226.8 288.6 (21.4 )% Minority interests (4.4 ) (6.8 ) N/M Net Income $ 222.4 $ 281.8 (21.1 )% N/M Not meaningful This pro forma combined financial information has been derived from the historical financial results of the respective U.S. businesses of MCBC and Miller, giving effect to the MillerCoors transaction and other related adjustments, described below.

Since this decision was due in large part to the combined brand portfolio at MillerCoors following its formation, a comparable amortization amount was included in the pro forma period. BAdjustment to reflect mark to market accounting for share based compensation held by MillerCoors employees. CAdjustments to conform classification between the MCBC U.S. business and the Miller U.S. business, and to conform the MCBC U.S. business accounting calendar from a twenty six week to a six calendar months ended December 31, 2007. DAdjustments to conform accounting policies with regard to inventory valuation, pension and postretirement plans and allocation of advertising costs between interim periods. 44 Table of Contents The following represents MCBCs proportional share of MillerCoors net income reported under the equity method (in millions): Twenty six weeks ended December 31, 2008 MillerCoors net income $ 222.4 MCBC economic interest 42 % MCBC proportionate share of MillerCoors net income 93.4 MillerCoors accounting policy elections(1)(2) 27.7 Amortization of the difference between MCBC contributed cost basis and proportional share of the underlying equity in net assets of MillerCoors(1)(3) 36.7 Share based compensation adjustment(1) (2.2 ) Equity Income in MillerCoors $ 155.6 (1)See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 3 "EQUITY INVESTMENTS", for a detailed discussion of these equity method adjustments. (2)We anticipate income of approximately $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2009 associated with this category. We do not anticipate any further amounts subsequent to the first quarter of 2009. (3)We anticipate that basis amortization income will be approximately $12 million for the full year of 2009. Asset impairments recorded by MillerCoors could change that amount significantly. The discussions below highlight the MillerCoors results of operations for the six months ended December 28, 2008, versus pro forma results for the same period in 2007. Volume and net sales Total reported volume declined 2.6% during the six months ended December 31, 2008, versus the six months ended December 31, 2007. Contract packaging volume declined 4.6% during the period, while sales volume to wholesalers declined 2.3% due largely to a higher depletion of distributor inventories since July 1, 2008, versus the same period in 2007. Domestic STRs increased 0.1% during the period (STRs decreased 0.7% when adjusting for trading day differences). STR performance reflects strong growth in five of MillerCoors six focus brands (Coors Light and Miller High Life reflecting single digit growth, with double digit growth experienced in MGD64, Blue Moon, and Keystone Light), which was largely offset by reductions in Miller Lite and Miller Chill performance. STR trends slowed during the fourth quarter, in line with an industry wide slowdown and during a time of significant price increases. Total net sales per barrel increased 5.3% in 2008 due to higher domestic business base pricing and reduced discounting compared to the level of price promotion activity we experienced during the second half of 2007. Revenue increases were due in part to the acceleration of price increases from early 2008 to the fall of 2008. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold increased to $66.96 per barrel in the six months ending December 31, 2008, versus $63.63 per barrel in the six months ending December 31, 2007. The net increase in cost of goods sold was driven by an increase in commodity, transportation and packaging costs, partly offset by the 45 Table of Contents MillerCoors legacy cost reduction initiatives (internally named Resources for Growth and Project Unicorn). Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by $20.7 million, or 2.0%, in 2008 versus 2007. Reductions were largely realized in general and administrative expenses and reflect the realization of organizational and non organizational synergy savings during the period. Marketing investments increased slightly, as incremental spending on MGD64 launch costs, increases in Coors Light media spending, and tactical sales expenses were partly offset by the non recurrence of prior year Miller Chill launch costs. Contract Settlement During the second half of 2007, Miller recognized a $43.1 million nonrecurring contract settlement from an aluminum supplier. The contract settlement relates to periods prior to 2007. Special Items MillerCoors recognized $103.8 million of special charges in 2008 compared to $28.2 million of net special charges in 2007. In 2008, the special charges were for integration related expenses for the MillerCoors joint venture and the impairment of the Sparks brand. MCBCs equity method accounting includes a favorable basis amortization income adjustment which offsets our 42% ($27.3 million) share of the $65.1 million Sparks impairment charge. Integration charges in 2008 include costs for severance, relocation, sales office closures and consulting costs. In 2007, the special charges were related to employee retention costs in anticipation of the MillerCoors joint venture and a newly initiated program focused on long term labor savings across the supply chain areas. United Kingdom Segment The United Kingdom segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands principally in the United Kingdom, our consolidated joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies but sold and delivered to retail by us) and the equity method Tradeteam joint venture for the distribution of products throughout Great Britain. 46 Table of Contents See "Outlook for 2009" for discussion of forward looking trends regarding the United Kingdom segment.

(2)Volumes represent net sales of owned brands, joint venture brands and exclude factored brand net sales volumes. (3)Interest income is earned on trade loans to U.K. on premise customers and is typically driven by note receivable balances outstanding from period to period. Foreign currency impact on results Our United Kingdom segment results were negatively affected by an 8% year over year decrease in the value of the British Pound Sterling ("GBP") against the USD in 2008. In 2007, the GBP strengthened versus the USD resulting in an 8% appreciation impact to USD earnings before income taxes over 2006. Volume and net sales Our United Kingdom segment owned brand volumes decreased 4% in 2008 versus 2007, reflecting poor summer weather, continuing effects from smoking bans in the first half of 2008, and a weakening economy in the U.K. Our United Kingdom segment net revenue per barrel in local currency increased by 4% in 2008, with approximately 2% of this change related to non owned factored brands that we deliver to retail, and our contract brewing arrangements which began mid year. Comparable U.K. owned brand net revenue per barrel in local currency increased by 4% in the year, due mainly to improved pricing in both the on premise and the off premise channels, along with favorable brand mix. Our United Kingdom segment owned brand volumes decreased in 2007 on a 52 week versus 53 week basis. After excluding the 53rd week, volume decreased 6% due to an extended period of unusually rainy and cool weather conditions throughout the summer in 2007, and the impact of the enacted smoking bans on the U.K. on premise channel beer market in the second half of 2007. 47 Table of Contents Our United Kingdom segment net revenue per barrel in local currency increased by 5% in 2007, with approximately 3% of this change related to non owned factored brands that we deliver to retail. In particular, we acquired the Camerons on premise distribution business early in the third quarter. The addition of this business will raise our Europe net sales per barrel and cost of goods per barrel several percentage points for the next year, due to a step up in our factored brand sales. U.K. owned brand net revenue per barrel in local currency increased nearly 3% in the year, due mainly to pricing improvements predominantly in the on premise channel. Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency increased by 4% in the year, with approximately 2% of this change related to factored brand sales, and contract brewing sales. Comparable cost of goods sold for our U.K. owned brands increased about 6% per barrel in local currency, driven by input cost inflation, higher pension costs, and the impact of spreading fixed costs over lower sales volume, partly offset by cost savings. Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency increased by 5% in 2007, with approximately 4% of this change related to factored brand sales, including Camerons. Cost of goods sold for our U.K. owned brands increased about 1% per barrel in local currency, driven by input cost inflation and the impact of spreading fixed costs over lower sales volume, partly offset by cost savings. Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. were relatively flat compared to 2007 in local currency. Marketing spending decreased by approximately 9% as management took action to reduce spending in line with the trading environment. General and administrative costs increased 6% compared to 2007 predominantly due to higher bad debt and pension charges. In 2007, marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. decreased approximately 3% in local currency. Marketing spending increased 2% due to the continued roll out of our new advertising campaigns for Carling, C2, and re launching Coors Light. General and administrative costs decreased 6% compared to 2006 due to cost reduction programs. Special items, net We recognized a net special credit of $4.5 million in 2008 and $14.1 million of special charges 2007. The 2008 items were predominately employee termination costs associated with the U.K. supply chain and back office restructuring efforts offset by a one time gain on the sale of non core business assets of $2.7 million and a one time pension gain of $10.4 million due to the cessation of employee service credit to its defined benefit pension plan. The 2007 items are noted below. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We recognized $14.1 million and $7.8 million of special charges in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2007 items were predominately employee termination costs associated with the U.K. supply chain and back office restructuring efforts and an increased pension liability in recognition of our existing pension benefit in accordance with U.K. law. The 2006 items were also a result of charges recognized as part of restructuring the supply chain operation and back office organization, partly offset by a pension curtailment gain due to the reduction in our workforce. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 48  Table of Contents Other (expense) income, net We incurred net other expense of $4.2 million and $0.1 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase noted is due to profit from our distribution joint venture, Tradeteam, being included in other income in 2007, but reclassified to cost of goods sold in 2008. We incurred net other expense of $0.1 million in 2007 as compared to a net other income of $4.8 million for 2006. The decrease noted is due to a non recurring gain recognized on a sale of a surplus property in 2006, partly offset by improved year over year profit performance by our distribution joint venture, Tradeteam. Interest income Interest income is earned on trade loans to U.K. on premise customers. Interest income in local currency versus the prior years was flat in 2008 and decreased by 2% in 2007. The year over year change for 2007 and 2006 is also a result of lower loan balances when compared to the prior year. Global Markets and Corporate Global Markets includes results of operations in developing markets around the world, including Asia, Mexico, the Caribbean (not including Puerto Rico) and continental Europe. Corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to the operating segments. The majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance, and risk management.

Marketing, general and administrative expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2008 were $137.7 million, down $6.9 million from 2007. This decrease was largely attributed to transfers of allocable costs to the operating segments from the corporate center, lower legal fees and reduced severance fees partially offset by increased incentive compensation. Marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2007 were $144.6 million, down $8.9 million from 2006. This decrease was largely attributed to transfers of allocable costs to the operating segments from the corporate center, lower legal fees and reduced severance fees partially offset by increased incentive pay resulting from improved operating performance over prior year. Special items, net The $58.2 million of special items in 2008 were a result of $28.8 million of deal costs and integration planning costs associated with the formation of MillerCoors. We also recognized $22.8 million of transition costs paid to our third party vendor associated with the start up of our outsourced administrative functions. Last, we incurred $6.6 million associated with other strategic initiatives. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The $13.4 million of special items in 2007 were a result of costs incurred associated with the proposed MillerCoors joint venture, and consist primarily of outside professional services. The special benefit of $4.0 million for 2006 was a result of $5.3 million adjustment to the floor provided on the exercise price of stock options held by former Coors officers who left the Company under change in control agreements following the Merger, partially offset by costs incurred in closing our sales operations in Russia. We did not recognize a charge related to the floor provided on the exercise price of the stock options as the stock price exceeded the floor price in 2008 and 2007. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 8 "SPECIAL ITEMS, NET" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest expense, net Net interest expense totaled $96.7 million for 2008, $14.7 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was primarily a result of lower average net debt levels outstanding. We also recognized a $12.4 million charge as a result of the debt extinguishment costs during 2008. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 13 "DEBT AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Net interest expense totaled $111.3 million for 2007, $27.1 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was primarily a result of lower average net debt levels outstanding. We also recognized a $24.5 million charge as a result of the debt extinguishment costs during 2007. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 13 "DEBT AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other income (expense), net Other expense, net in 2008 increased from 2007 due to greater foreign currency exchange losses throughout the current year. Other expense, net in 2007 increased from 2006 due to greater foreign currency exchange losses throughout the current year. 50 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by operating activities, external borrowings and asset monetizations. As of December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, we had net working capital of $121.0 million and $41.3 million, respectively. We commonly operate at a low level of working capital or working capital deficits given the relatively quick turnover of our receivables and inventory. We had total cash and cash equivalents of $216.2 million at December 28, 2008, compared to $377.0 million at December 30, 2007. Long term debt was $1,831.7 million and $2,260.6 million at December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, respectively. Debt as of the end of 2008 consisted primarily of notes with longer term maturities. We believe that cash flows from operations, including distributions from MillerCoors, and cash provided by short term borrowings, when necessary, will be more than adequate to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. Our business generates positive operating cash flow, and our debt maturities are of a longer term nature. As a result, we believe the current unstable state of the financial and credit markets will not significantly impact our liquidity in the near term. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a downturn in consumer spending, a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages or any of the other factors we describe in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $411.5 million for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2008, was lower by $204.5 million from the 52 week period ending December 30, 2007. Our 2008 operating cash flow and related comparisons to 2007 were influenced by a number of discrete factors. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans (excluding MillerCoors contributions in the second half of 2008) were higher in 2008 versus 2007 by $25.9 million, the impact of which is represented in changes in other assets and other liabilities. We made a $100 million contribution to the U.K. pension plan near the end of the year, making contributions to the U.K. plan higher in 2008 by $95.8 million when compared with 2007. Contributions to plans in Canada were higher by $4.0 million, offset by lower contributions to U.S. plans of $73.9 million (again, excluding MillerCoors contributions in the second half of 2008). There was a discretionary $50.0 million contribution to the U.S. plan in 2007. Cash outflows paid by our U.S. business (prior to formation of MillerCoors) and our corporate group related to the formation of MillerCoors were higher by $59.5 million in 2008 than in 2007, the impact of which is represented in changes in other assets and other liabilities. These costs included employee retention costs, deal costs, and integration planning costs. We paid approximately $40 million in employee withholding taxes during 2008 with the vesting of performance share units ("PSUs"). We withheld shares from employees, allowing them to satisfy their withholding obligation, which was a non cash activity. However, cash was paid to the taxing authorities by the Company to satisfy the employees obligation, which reduced operating cash flow. There was no comparable event in 2007. Offsetting these items was the 2007 final contribution to the Memphis employees multiemployer pension plan of $27.6 million, an outflow that did not occur in 2008. Distributions from MillerCoors for the six months ended December 31, 2008, were $136.5 million. With regard to MillerCoors, there were several items which directly impacted the level of cash distributions received in the last half of 2008: MillerCoors placed approximately $170.0 million on deposit with aluminum suppliers and derivative counterparties due to collateral requirements related to an unfavorable fixed price contract and derivative positions related to aluminum hedging and other price risk mitigation programs. Our 42% portion of the collateral amount is $71.4 million. (These 51 Table of Contents amounts effectively amount to prepayments of amounts that could be due over the next one to three years if aluminum and other commodity prices stay at their currently low levels.) MillerCoors incurred severance restructuring and integration costs of $38.7 million in the last half of 2008, our 42% portion of which is $16.3 million. These costs are necessary to attain the synergies of the MillerCoors combination. In addition, MillerCoors incurred approximately $70.0 million of capital expenditures related specifically to synergy attainment, our 42% portion of which is $29.4 million. MillerCoors also incurred baseline capital expenditures not related specifically to synergy attainment. MillerCoors contributed $71 million to defined benefit pension plans in the last half of 2008, our 42% portion of which is $29.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $616.0 million for the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2007, was lower by $217.2 million from the 53 week period ending December 31, 2006. Net income was higher by $136.2 million in 2007 versus 2006, the reasons for which are discussed in detail in the Results of Operations discussion in this section. However, various non cash components of net income resulted in a lower amount of our expenses in 2007 versus 2006 by $135.4 million. Therefore, net income adjusted for its various non cash components was effectively flat year over year. These non cash components consisted of depreciation and amortization (lower in 2007 by $92.5 million), amortization of debt costs, share based compensation and related tax benefits, gains and losses on sales of assets, impairment losses on long lived assets, and deferred taxes. The lower operating cash flows in 2007 were therefore due primarily to cash movements associated with working capital and other assets and liabilities. Specifically, collections on accounts receivable were lower in 2007 due primarily to lower collections in the U.K., where the 53 week year in 2006 resulted in an extra week of collections in that year. Cash paid for inventories was higher in 2007 as our Canada segment increased finished goods and packaging materials inventories in anticipation of an expansion of business in western Canada as a result of a new joint venture agreement with Modelo. Cash outflows associated with accrued expenses and other liabilities were greater in 2007 versus 2006 due to higher defined benefit pension contributions of $47.6 million, a one time payment to a non employer pension plan associated with our former Memphis, Tennessee, brewery of $27.6 million, and higher cash taxes of $39.2 million. Offsetting these items was lower cash paid for interest of $28.1 million. We expect that 2009 operating cash flows will continue to be challenged by a difficult operating environment, and MillerCoors continuing investments as part of their $500 million synergy generation initiatives. Also, our indemnity obligations to FEMSA related to our discontinued business in Brazil represent an ongoing risk due to the uncertain nature of those obligations. Offsetting these risks is a positive pricing environment in nearly all of our markets early in 2009, and the expectation that MillerCoors will begin delivering substantial cost synergies in 2009. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $269.5 million for the year ended December 28, 2008 was lower by $169.6 million compared to 2007. The primary reason for the variance between years was lower additions to properties in 2008. Higher additions in 2007 were related to the completion of the build out and conversion of CBCs Shenandoah, Virginia facility from a packaging facility to a full brewery and packaging facility. The Shenandoah facility was contributed to MillerCoors in 2008 along with CBCs other assets and liabilities. 2007 additions also included CBLs $90.0 million expenditure for the purchase of kegs in the U.K. from our former third party logistics service provider. Investing activities were also favorable by $45.6 million due to purchases in 2007 and subsequent sales in 2008 of investment securities. We also purchased a U.K. wholesaler business for $26.7 million in 2007, with no comparable purchases in 2008. 2008 outflows included $84.3 million of cash contributed to MillerCoors at its initial formation. 52 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities of $439.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2007 was higher by $144.3 million compared to 2006. The primary reason for the variance between years was lower cash inflows associated with sales of assets and businesses. In 2007, these proceeds totaled approximately $38.1 million, with the largest proceeds associated with the sale of our investment in the House of Blues Canada business, which resulted in $30.0 million of proceeds. However, in 2006, we collected $145.1 million of proceeds; specifically, we collected $79.5 million from the sale of the Kaiser business in Brazil, $36.5 million from the sale of our preferred equity interests in the Montr&eacute;al Canadiens hockey club, and $29.1 million from various other sales. In 2007, we spent $26.7 million to acquire an on premise distribution business in the U.K., while we had no business acquisitions in 2006, and invested $22.8 million in short term investments, versus no such investments in 2006. Partially offsetting these items in 2007 versus 2006, additions to properties and intangible assets were lower by $18.0 million due primarily to higher capital additions in 2006 associated with the build out of the Shenandoah brewery in the U.S., offset by CBLs large purchase of kegs in April 2007 of $90.0 million. Financing Activities Our debt position significantly affects our financing activity. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 13 "DEBT AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our debt position at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $266.9 million in 2008, compared to net cash provided of $8.4 million during 2007, an unfavorable variance of $275.3 million. We collected $150.5 million less in proceeds from employee exercises of stock options in 2008 versus 2007. During 2008, we repaid $181.3 million of long term notes through early retirement. During 2007, our primary activities involved refinancing a significant portion of our debt portfolio by issuing $575.0 million in convertible notes, while repaying $625.0 million of our previously existing senior notes. We also spent a net $49.7 million for the purchase of a note hedge and sale of warrants associated with the convertible notes and $10.2 million for costs directly associated with the convertible notes offering. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $8.4 million in 2007, compared to net cash used of $401.2 million during 2006, a favorable variance of $409.7 million. We collected $126.2 million more in proceeds from employee exercises of stock options in 2007 versus 2006. Debt related cash flows during 2007 were discussed above. During 2006, most of our activity associated with debt obligations was associated with repayments, which totaled $355.4 million. Capital Resources See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 13 "DEBT AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, including lines of credit. As discussed in the Financing Activities section above, during the second quarter of 2007, we issued $575.0 million of senior convertible notes, with a coupon rate of interest of 2.5%. In the third quarter of 2007, we used the proceeds of the convertible notes issuance, combined with other sources of cash, to retire $625.0 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2012 and fund additional related charges as noted above. On February 7, 2008, we announced a tender for and repurchase of any and all principal amount of our remaining 6.375% $225 million Senior Notes due 2012, with the tender period running through February 14, 2008. The amount actually repurchased was $180.4 million. The net costs of $12.4 million related to this extinguishment of debt and termination of related interest rate swaps was recorded in the first quarter of 2008. The debt extinguishment was funded by existing cash resources. The vast majority of our remaining debt borrowings as of December 28, 2008, consisted of publicly traded notes totaling $1.7 billion principal amount, with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2015. Our remaining debt other than the notes consists of various notes payable of $176.0 million at consolidated 53 Table of Contents joint ventures, which mature in 2011. We maintain a $750 million revolving multi currency bank credit facility to manage short term liquidity requirements through periods of lower operating cash flow. There were no outstanding borrowings under this financing vehicle as of December 28, 2008. We maintained a $500 million commercial paper program through 2008 and in prior years. We had not borrowed under the commercial paper program since 2006. In consideration of the costs to maintain the program, as well as the relatively high interest costs that would be incurred should we borrow under the program given our credit rating standings and the current financial credit markets, we anticipate that we will close our commercial paper program in February 2009. While the start up of MillerCoors entails potential demands for capital for integration and restructuring efforts, we will need to consider different alternatives for the use of cash generated from operations. We expect to take a balanced approach to our alternatives in 2009 and beyond, which could include pension plan funding elections, dividend increases, stock repurchases, reinvesting cash into our existing businesses and preserving cash flexibility for potential strategic investments. Any repurchases of MCBC stock on the open market would require a board approved plan, which does not currently exist. Credit markets in the United States and across the globe are currently unstable due to the recent financial crisis. Based on communications with lenders that are party to our $750 million committed credit facility, we have no indication of any issues with our ability to draw on such credit facility if the need arose. We currently have no borrowings outstanding under this facility. Credit Rating On July 3, 2008, Moodys affirmed our Baa2/Prime2 ratings and changed the outlook to positive from developing, following the formation of MillerCoors. Our long term credit rating with Standard and Poors is BBB. On February 11, 2009, Standard and Poors announced it had placed MCBC on credit watch with negative implications. Standard and Poors indicated that if any downgrade were to occur, it would be limited to one notch (BBB ), which is still "investment grade," but only one notch above "below investment grade." Any future downgrade to "below investment grade" would increase borrowing costs under our revolving line of credit (under which there were no borrowings as of December 28, 2008), and trigger certain collateral requirements on out of the money derivative liabilities, as discussed in Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 18 "DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. MillerCoors MillerCoors distributes its excess cash to its owners, SABMiller and MCBC, on a 58%/42% basis, respectively. MillerCoors does not carry significant debt obligations, and there are no restrictions from external sources on its ability to make cash distributions to its owners. However, we expect that our 2009 operating cash flows and investing cash flows will be unfavorably impacted by MillerCoors internal cash flow requirements. We anticipate that MillerCoors will spend approximately $170 million in 2009 related to restructuring and integration costs, and capital spending, to capture synergies. Also, MillerCoors contributions to its defined benefit pension plans are expected to be $100 $140 million in 2009. Capital Expenditures In 2008, we spent $230.5 million (including approximately $21.4 million spent at consolidated joint ventures) on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, approximately 38% was in support of the U.K. segment, with the remainder split between the U.S. first half of 2008 (24%), Canada (32%) and Global Markets and Corporate (6%). The capital expenditure plan for 2009 is expected to be approximately $140 million, excluding MillerCoors and our consolidated joint ventures. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Contractual Cash Obligations as of December 28, 2008 Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (In millions) Total debt, including current maturities(1) $ 1,831.8 $ 0.1 $ 476.1 $ 619.4 $ 736.2 Interest payments(2) 380.3 80.9 137.2 97.6 64.6 Derivative payments(2) 2,525.8 117.3 590.2 1,818.3 Retirement plan expenditures(3) 184.2 78.5 19.7 21.8 64.2 Operating leases 225.5 53.8 77.2 45.6 48.9 Capital leases 0.4 0.4 Other long term obligations(4) 3,750.4 634.0 1,147.4 406.8 1,562.2 Total obligations $ 8,898.4 $ 965.0 $ 2,447.8 $ 3,009.5 $ 2,476.1 (1)Refer to debt schedule in Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 13 "DEBT AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2)The "interest payments" line includes interest on our bonds and other borrowings outstanding at December 28, 2008, excluding the cash flow impacts of any interest rate or cross currency swaps. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. The "derivative payments" line includes the floating rate payment obligations, which are paid to counterparties under our interest rate and cross currency swap agreements, &pound;530 million ($773 million at December 28, 2008 exchange rates) payment due the cross currency swap counterparty in 2012, CAD$1,201 million ($983 million at December 28, 2008 exchange rates) payment due the cross currency swap counterparty in 2012, CAD $355 million ($291 million at December 28, 2008 exchange rates) payment due the cross currency swap counterparty in 2010, and CAD $100 million ($82 million at December 28, 2008 exchange rates) payment due the cross currency swap counterparty in 20011. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. We anticipate receiving a total of $2,315 million in fixed and floating rate payments from our counterparties under the swap arrangements, which offset the payments included in the table. As interest rates increase, payments to or receipts from our counterparties will also increase. Net interest payments, including swap receipts and payments by period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (In millions) $ 590.6 $ 78.8 $ 128.0 $ 319.2 $ 64.6 (3)Represents expected contributions under our defined benefit pension plans in the next twelve months and our benefits payments under retiree medical plans for all periods presented. (4)Approximately $447 million of the total other long term obligations relate to long term supply contracts with third parties to purchase raw material and energy used in production. Approximately $1,236 million relates to commitments associated with Tradeteam in the United Kingdom. The remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing, information technology services, open purchase orders and other commitments. Not included in these contractual cash obligations are $230.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $124.8 million of indemnities provided to FEMSA for which we are unable to make estimates for timing of any related cash payments. 55 Table of Contents Other Commercial Commitments as of December 28, 2008 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (In millions) Standby letters of credit $ 34.5 $ 34.5 $ $ $ Advertising and Promotions As of December 28, 2008, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $281 million over the next five years and thereafter. Our advertising and promotions commitments are included in other long term obligations in the contractual cash obligations table above. Pension Plans Our consolidated, unfunded pension position at the end of 2008 was approximately $319 million, an increase of $144 million from the end of 2007. Our unfunded position in the U.K. increased from $91.3 million at the end of the 2007 to $222.9 million at the end of 2008, despite employer contributions of $127.5 million, actuarial gains to the discounted benefit obligation of $167.1 million (due mainly to a higher discount rate in 2008), and a $98.5 million reduction to the net liability as a result of foreign exchange translation (GBP weakened versus the USD during 2008). Offsetting these items was a $371.0 million loss on plan assets. Our unfunded position in Canada increased from $63.6 million to $89.2 million, despite $100.4 million of employer contributions, actuarial gains to the discounted benefit obligation of $197.1 million (due mainly to a higher discount rate in 2008), and a $25.6 million reduction to the net liability as a result of foreign exchange translation (CAD weakened versus the USD during 2008). Offsetting these items was a $194.5 million loss on plan assets. Our contribution of the CBC pension plan to MillerCoors had little impact because it was largely funded at the end of 2007. The decline in the market value of the plans assets was the result of the global financial and economic crisis in late 2008. Approximately $29.6 million of the underfunded pension position at the end of 2008 was the responsibility of the minority owners of BRI. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 16 "EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on the funded status of these plans. We fund pension plans to meet the requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws. Sometimes we voluntarily increase funding levels to meet expense and asset return forecasts in any given year. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were $228.6 million in 2008, which include a discretionary $100 million contribution in the United Kingdom. MillerCoors contributed $71 million to its pension plans in the last half of 2008. We anticipate making approximately $69.4 million (including approximately $20.8 million at consolidated joint ventures) of both statutory and voluntary contributions to our pension plans in 2009. We have taken numerous steps in recent years to reduce our exposure to these long term obligations, including the closure of the U.K. pension plan to future earning of service credit in late 2008. However, the cash requirements of these plans, and their dependence upon the global financial markets for their financial health, will continue to require potentially significant amounts of cash funding. Postretirement Benefit Plans Our consolidated, unfunded postretirement benefit position at the end of 2008 was approximately $210.2 million, a decrease of $259.8 million from the end of 2007. Benefits paid under our postretirement benefit plans were approximately $17.6 million in 2008 and $24.5 million in 2007. The largest component of this decrease was the contribution of the U.S. plan to MillerCoors, which had $146.3 million unfunded position when contributed. Actuarial gains due to higher discount rates and 56 Table of Contents liability reductions due to foreign exchange translation accounted for the remainder of the decrease. Under our postretirement benefit plans, we expect payments of approximately $9.1 million in 2009. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 17 "POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on these plans. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business or in the course of the sale of a business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify third parties from any losses or guarantees incurred relating to pre existing conditions for losses or guarantees arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 20 "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES" to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the captions "Environmental," "Indemnity Obligations Sale of Kaiser" and See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 3 "EQUITY INVESTMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Montr&eacute;al Canadiens." MillerCoors Sparks Sparks, a MillerCoors brand, is a leading product in the caffeinated alcohol beverages category. During 2008, a task force of the National Association of Attorneys General, the umbrella organization for the states attorneys general in the U.S., had expressed concern about this category and product (collectively, the "AGs Investigations"). In December 2008, MillerCoors reached an agreement with the AGs to reformulate the Sparks products to remove all caffeine, guarana, ginseng and taurine. In addition, with limited exceptions, MillerCoors agreed to not produce any additional products containing caffeine or guarana, and also made certain changes to its marketing to reflect concerns raised by the AGs. MillerCoors also agreed to pay $0.6 million for the costs of the AGs Investigations. In September 2008, a public interest litigation group filed suit against MillerCoors in a local court in the District of Columbia, alleging that Sparks is an "adulterated product" because it contains caffeine and other ingredients that the group claims have not been determined by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to be generally recognized as safe for use in alcoholic beverages (D.C. Superior Court No. 2008 CA 6605). Because of the above referenced AG agreement, MillerCoors is confident that this lawsuit will be dismissed. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 28, 2008, we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K). Outlook for 2009 We will continue our focus on being a world class, brand led Company. We will promote our strategic brands by investing in the "front end" of our business our marketing and sales activities. We will do so with a complete commitment to corporate social responsibility. In 2009, we will continue to focus on building strong brands, reducing costs in each of our businesses, and generating cash. In Canada, as with our other global markets, we will balance the priorities of price and volume, with a bias to invest in and grow our brands. Price discounting activity has continued, especially in the Qu&eacute;bec off premise channel, which has hurt our volume trends. Recent price increases across the major Canadian provinces have offset some of the impact of competitive discounting. We will remain focused on balancing our strategic volume priorities and building the equity of 57 Table of Contents our brands, while ensuring that we continue to be price competitive on a market by market basis. Also, late in 2008, Blue Moon production was moved from our Montr&eacute;al brewery to MillerCoors, and we have taken action to reduce staffing levels and other costs to offset the negative financial impact of lower production levels. In the U.S., MillerCoors will continue working to deliver upon the $500 million synergy commitment, while maintaining the strong momentum of the MillerCoors strategic brands. In the U.K., we anticipate a challenging trading environment to continue in 2009 due to the weak local economy. Commodity inflation will also be a challenge in 2009. Nonetheless, we believe that our U.K. business is now on a firmer footing as it benefits from our new contract brewing arrangement, the Magners cider agreement, and recent supplier renegotiations. Moreover, our brand strength has consistently supported positive pricing, and we increased prices effective the first quarter of 2009. Regarding costs, our management teams continue to exceed their goals for reducing costs in each business. The current inflationary environment presents a significant challenge for us to overcome by continuing to drive pricing and cost savings across many areas of our business. Looking to the final year of the RFG program, we are confident that we can achieve our three year RFG goal of $250 million. These savings will be incremental to the $500 million anticipated MillerCoors cost synergies. In Canada, we expect our comparable 2009 cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency to increase at a low single digit rate versus 2008 due to continued inflationary pressures, partially offset by anticipated reductions in certain commodity and fuel inflation rates in 2009, along with continued delivery of our RFG savings inititives. MillerCoors plans to deliver approximately $128 million of its cost synergies in the first half of 2009. By the end of calendar 2009, MillerCoors expects to achieve a total of $238 million in synergies, surpassing MillerCoors original forecast of $225 million. This does not reflect a change in the original $500 million, three year program, but rather an acceleration in the delivery of those synergies. Our U.K. team is targeting substantial savings as part of the RFG program, driven by supplier negotiations and operational efficiencies. In a challenging industry volume environment, our preliminary view for 2009 is that U.K. owned brand cost of goods will increase at a low double digit rate per barrel in local currency, driven by mid single digit inflation and production mix changes, which are related to relative growth in contract brewing, Magners cider, and off premise sales. Most of these mix changes also increase net sales per barrel and are broadly neutral to gross margin. Finally, with regard to foreign currency impacts, if the Canadian Dollar and British Pound remain consistent relative to the U.S. Dollar, we may face substantial currency translation impacts in the first three quarters of 2009 when compared with the 2008 actual results for those periods: At 2008 year end rates, Canadian Dollar devaluation would negatively impact our Canada pretax earnings by approximately 15% to 20% over prior year pretax earnings in each of the first three quarters of 2009, with minimal impact in the 4th quarter. We anticipate our debt structure and currency hedging programs would offset about 50% to 60% of this foreign currency translation impact in 2009. British Pound devaluation would negatively impact our U.K. pretax earnings by about 25% to 30% in the second and third quarters of the year, with a 10% impact in the fourth quarter. Our U.K. business generally reports a small loss in the first quarter, so currency effects are minimized. We have no significant currency hedges focused on British Pound exposures. 58 Table of Contents Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we expect to deconsolidate Brewers Retail Inc. ("BRI"), which operates the Ontario beer stores. BRI is a variable interest entity, and until now we have held a majority of the variable interests in it, requiring its consolidation. Since our variable interests are based on market share and usage levels of BRIs services, another variable interest holders acquisition activity has caused our variable interests to decrease, causing us to no longer be the primary beneficiary. Upon deconsolidation we will account for BRI using the equity method of accounting. This change will decrease Canada pretax income and decrease Corporate interest expense a similar amount, resulting in no significant impact on consolidated results of operations. In 2008, we reported approximately $10 million related to BRI pretax income and interest expense. Upon adoption of FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS 160"), we may record a one time gain or loss related to deconsolidation of BRI as we apply fair value accounting to the deconsolidation of this entity. Global Markets and Corporate We forecast full year 2009 global markets and corporate general and administrative expense of approximately $150 million, plus or minus 5%. Interest We anticipate 2009 corporate net interest expense of approximately $90 million at December 28, 2008 foreign exchange rates, excluding U.K. trade loan interest income. Tax Our tax rate is volatile and may move up or down with changes in, among other things, the amount and source of income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, changes in tax laws, and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to FIN 48 for uncertain tax positions as statute of limitations expire or positions are otherwise effectively settled. During 2009, the Company expects to recognize a $50 to $60 million income tax benefit due to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. This income tax benefit is primarily due to penalties and interest associated with issues subject to audits that we believe are going to close in the next year. As a result, we anticipate that our 2009 effective tax rate on income will be in the range of 16% to 20%. We note, however, that there are other pending tax law changes in Canada that, if enacted, would result in an approximate $100 million additional decrease to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. This one time, non cash income tax benefit would be recognized in the quarter in which the bill is enacted. In addition, there are other pending law changes in the U.S., U.K., and Canada that, if enacted, could have an impact on our effective tax rate. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. We review our accounting policies on an on going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations. 59 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees in Canada and the United Kingdom. We also have postretirement welfare plans in Canada and the United States that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS 87") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106") and SFAS No. 158 "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)." These statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions. At the end of each fiscal year, we perform an analysis of high quality corporate bonds and compare the results to appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in Canada. We reference a published bond index rate whose duration reflects our obligations in determining our discount rate with respect to U.K. pension liabilities. Discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year and impact expense in the subsequent year. A 50 basis point change in certain assumptions made at the beginning of 2008 would have had the following effects on 2008 pension expense: Impact to 2008 pension costs 50 basis points (unfavorable) favorable Description of pension sensitivity item Reduction Increase (In millions) Expected return on Canada salary plan assets, 4.90% $ (1.3 ) $ 1.3 Expected return on Canada hourly plan assets, 7.85% $ (3.4 ) $ 3.4 Expected return on Canada BRI plan assets, 7.60% $ (2.3 ) $ 2.3 Expected return on U.K. plan assets, 7.50% $ (7.8 ) $ 7.8 Discount rate on Canada salary pension expense, 5.25% $ 0.5 $ (0.4 ) Discount rate on Canada hourly pension expense, 5.25% $ (0.2 ) $ 0.1 Discount rate on Canada BRI pension expense, 5.25% $ (1.4 ) $ 1.4 Discount rate on U.S. pension expense, 6.45% $ $ Discount rate on U.K. pension expense, 6.00% $ (12.8 ) $ 2.2 Certain components of pension and postretirement benefits expense are impacted by methodologies that normalize, or "smooth," changes to the funded status of the liabilities with respect to their recognition in the income statement. We employ two primary methodologies in this respect: the "market related value" approach for assets valuation and the "corridor approach" for amortizing actuarial gains and losses. Our expected return on assets percentage factor is not applied to the actual market value of assets as of the end of the preceding year in determining that component of pension expense; rather it is applied to the "market related value," which employs an asset smoothing approach to the asset pools. While employer contributions and realized gains and losses (such as dividends received or gains and losses on sales of assets) are reflected immediately in the "market related value" of assets, unrealized gains and losses are amortized into the "market related value" over five years. Therefore, only 20% of the significant unrealized losses in asset values experienced in the later part of 2008 will enter into "market related value" asset pools upon which 2009 60 Table of Contents expected return on plan assets (a component of pension expense) will be calculated. However, those losses continue to be amortized into the "market related value" pools of assets through 2013. Therefore, if asset values do not recover or recover more slowly than they declined, future years pension expense will continue to be impacted by the losses experienced in late 2008. Our pension and postretirement plans expense is also influenced by the amortization (or non amortization) of gains and losses. Gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from estimates and assumptions with regard to asset returns, discount rates and other estimates related to plan participants, such as turnover, mortality and rate of salary increases. Such gains and losses impact the funded status of our plans when they are measured, with an offset in other comprehensive income, thereby deferring their recognition in the income statement. We employ a "corridor" approach for determining the potential amortization of these gains and losses as a component of pension and postretirement plans expense. To the extent gains and losses are greater than a set threshold or "outside the corridor," the difference is amortized over the remaining working life of the plans participants. If a plan has been closed, such as our U.K. Plan as of April 1, 2009, the remaining life of all plan participants (including retirees) is used for the amortization period. The corridor is defined as the greater of 10% of a plans projected benefit obligation or 10% of a plans assets. The "market related value" approach for asset impacts the amortization of gains and losses because any one years plan assets gains or losses are amortized over a five year period (20% per year) when determining the gains and losses to be compared to the 10% corridor. Similar to the impact on expected return on plan assets discussed above, this may result in significant movements in pension expense for several years following a significant loss or gain, such as the loss we experienced in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. Additionally, increases in discount rates, such as we experienced in 2008, created gains in our plans, which offset asset losses within the corridor. As a result, we will reflect little if any amortization of gains or losses in 2009 pension expense for the U.K. and Canada plans because their relevant gains and losses are inside the corridor. However, the significant asset losses from late 2008 will continue to enter into the calculation of gains and losses to be compared against the corridor through 2013. To the extent that asset values do not recover, or do not recover as rapidly as they declined, this factor creates risk of higher pension expense in future years due to the potential amortization of losses. The table above demonstrates the potential impact of the amortization of gains and losses, specifically with regard to the last line showing the hypothetical impact on 2008 pension expense of a 50 basis point decrease the U.K. plans discount rate. Had the discount rate chosen for the U.K. plan at the end of 2007 been 5.5% instead of 6.0%, the U.K. plans losses would have exceeded the corridor and higher pension expense for 2008 in the amount of $12.8 million would have been recognized due the amortization of a portion of those losses. MillerCoors also employs a corridor approach with regard to amortizing gains and losses present in their pension and postretirement plans. However, MillerCoors uses the "market value" approach to determine plan asset gains and losses to be compared to the corridor, meaning there is no smoothing of those asset gains and losses over five years. As a result, MillerCoors pension expense is subject to additional volatility when compared to MCBCs plan. As a result, their 2009 pension expense will be significantly higher than 2008 pension expense, unfavorably impacting our equity method income in 2009 from MillerCoors. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 16 "EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS" and Note 17 "POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information about the financial status of these plans. 61 Table of Contents Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan.

Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. The following compares target asset allocation percentages with actual asset allocations at December 28, 2008: Canada plans assets U.K. plan assets Target allocations Actual allocations Target allocations Actual allocations Equities 42.0 % 35.2 % 50.0 % 43.3 % Fixed income 58.0 % 64.3 % 40.0 % 42.3 % Real estate 0.0 % 0.0 % 7.0 % 6.5 % Other 0.0 % 0.5 % 3.0 % 7.9 % Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves We estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to any pending matter and revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. We also expense legal costs as incurred. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 20 "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves at December 28, 2008. In 2006, we sold our interest in the Kaiser business. While we reduced our risk profile as a result of this transaction, we retained risk by providing indemnities to the buyer for certain purchased tax credits and for other tax, labor and civil contingencies in general. These are referenced in the section called "Contingencies" above and discussed in Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 20 "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We use multiple probability weighted scenarios in determining the values of indemnity liabilities. As discussed in Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 20 62 Table of Contents "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have recorded probable loss liabilities of $51.4 million and have estimated the value of the indemnity liability associated with purchased tax credits at $69.3 million, based on a total exposure of $306.0 million with regard to those liabilities. If the indemnity obligations were recorded as probable losses, our liabilities would have been higher by approximately $17.1 million at December 28, 2008. Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We completed the evaluations of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the third quarter of 2008. With regard to goodwill, the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, allowing us to conclude that no impairments of goodwill have occurred. With regard to our indefinite lived intangible assets, most significantly Molsons core brands sold in Canada, the Carling brand sold in the U.K., and distribution rights to sell Coors Light in Canada, the fair values of the assets also exceeded their carrying values. Significant judgments and assumptions were required in the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 12 "GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and presentation of these amounts. We use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and evaluations of values derived from market comparable transactions and earnings multiples of comparable public companies to determine the fair value of reporting units. Our cash flow projections are based on various long range financial and operational plans of the Company and considered, when necessary, various scenarios, both favorable and unfavorable. In 2008, discount rates used for fair value estimates for reporting units was 9%. These rates are based on weighted average cost of capital, driven by, among other factors, the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate, as well as the credit ratings and financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit. We use an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets. Discount rates used for testing of indefinite lived intangibles ranged from 9% to 10%. These rates largely reflect the rates for the overall enterprise valuations, with some level of premium associated with the specificity of the intangibles themselves. Our reporting units operate in relatively mature beer markets, where we are reliant on a major brand for a high percentage of sales. Changes in the factors used in the estimates, including declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales, margin erosion, termination of brewing and or distribution agreements with other brewers, and discount rates used, could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units and, consequently, may result in goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The following tables present a roll forward of the fair values of debt and derivative contracts outstanding as well as their maturity dates and how those fair values were obtained (in millions): Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 30, 2007 $ (2,839.7 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 454.0 Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 22.3 Other changes in fair value 404.8 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 28, 2008 $ (1,958.6 ) 63 Table of Contents Fair value of contracts at December 28, 2008 Source of fair value Maturities less than 1 year Maturities 1 3 years Maturities 4 5 years Maturities in excess of 5 years Total fair value Prices actively quoted $ $ (302.3 ) $ (46.8 ) $ (1,299.3 ) $ (1,648.4 ) Prices provided by other external sources 30.6 (339.4 ) (308.8 ) Prices based on models and other valuation methods (1.4 ) (1.4 ) $ 29.2 $ (641.7 ) $ (46.8 ) $ (1,299.3 ) $ (1,958.6 ) We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We record our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value. Such accounting is complex, as are the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair values of our derivatives are determined primarily from observable inputs that generally fall into Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy defined by SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 1 "BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES" under the caption "Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The fair values of our derivatives include credit risk adjustments to account for counterparties credit risk (for derivative assets) and MCBCs non performance risk (for derivative liabilities). These non performance reserves resulted in a $7 million favorable adjustment to other comprehensive income, mainly because derivative liabilities exceed derivative assets as of the end of 2008. Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and total return equity swaps. We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk, equity price risk and related derivatives using sensitivity analysis. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity price, specifically the stock price of Fosters Group ("Fosters") (ASX:FGL). During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into a cash settled total return swap with a Deutsche Bank in order to gain an economic exposure to Fosters, a major global brewer. The swap gives MCBC exposure to nearly 5% of Fosters outstanding common stock. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. We are required to post collateral with the counterparty if the swap is in an out of the money position. If our credit ratings with Standard & Poors and Moodys with regard to our long term debt remain at an investment grade level, we are required to post collateral for only that portion of the out of the money liability exceeding $20.0 million. If either of our credit ratings falls below investment grade, we must post collateral for the entire out of the money liability. As of December 28, 2008, neither party to this swap agreement has posted any collateral. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy. Therefore, actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below. 64 Table of Contents The following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis, which reflects the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices of our derivative and debt portfolio: As of Estimated fair value volatility December 28, 2008 December 30, 2007 (In millions) Foreign currency risk: Forwards $ (16.6 ) $ (45.5 ) Interest rate risk: Debt, swaps $ (74.5 ) $ (95.0 ) Commodity price risk: Swaps $ $ (19.1 ) Cross currency risk: Swaps $ (6.5 ) $ (5.2 ) Equity price risk: Cash settled total return swap $ (33.9 ) $ Income Tax Assumptions We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. We apply a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized in cases where uncertainty exists. First, the tax position is evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination. If the tax position is deemed "more likely than not" to be sustained, the tax position is then valued to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. Our balance sheet reflects liabilities for such unrecognized tax benefits of $230.4 million as of December 28, 2008. During 2009, we expect to recognize a $50 million to $60 million income tax benefit due to a reduction in income tax benefits, related mainly to penalties and interest associated with issues subject to audits we believe are going to close in the next year. There are other pending tax law changes in Canada that, if enacted, would decrease our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $100 million. We have elected to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through December 28, 2008, as permanently reinvested under the accounting guidance of APB 23 and SFAS 109. As of December 28, 2008, approximately $970 million of retained earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries was considered to be indefinitely invested. Our intention is to reinvest the indefinitely invested earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so. It is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted. However, we believe that U.S. foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any U.S. taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due upon remittance. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a 65 Table of Contents determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Consolidations under FIN 46R RMMC and RMBC were dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass container businesses. Effective July 1, 2008, RMMC and RMBC were contributed to MillerCoors (who consolidates their results) and de consolidated by MCBC. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide a long term relationship with that brands owner in a key segment of the U.K. beer market. We also consolidate the financial position and results of Brewers Retail, Inc. ("BRI"), of which Molson owns just over 50%, and provides all distribution and retail sales of beer in the province of Ontario in Canada. Our ownership of BRI is determined by our market share in the province of Ontario. Our market share and ownership percentage could be reduced as a result of lower trade or consolidation of certain of our competitors. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 141R "Business Combinations" In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"), which replaces SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Under the provisions of SFAS 141R, acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS 141R will be effective, on a prospective basis, for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the beginning of our fiscal year 2009, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies for which the adoption is retrospective. We are currently evaluating the effects, that SFAS 141R will have on our financial statements. The immediate impact of the income tax accounting provisions will increase volatility to our effective tax rate in 2009 and subsequent years. We have no business combination activity in process as of December 28, 2008. However, if we were to initiate business combination activity in 2009, the application of FAS 141R would have an immediate impact on our financial results as it requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred. Also, the significant differences in purchase price accounting required by FAS 141R could add volatility to our results if we complete acquisitions in future periods. SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" In December 2007, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS 160") and is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2009. This Statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest, (formerly referred to as minority interest), as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. It also amends certain of ARB No. 51s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141R, including procedures associated with the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. The adoption of SFAS 160 in the first quarter of 2009 will require the reclassification of our reported non controlling interests to stockholders equity. The adoption of SFAS 160 will also change our reported Net Income in the first quarter of 2009, which will include the 66 Table of Contents share of Net Income attributable to non controlling interests. A new deduction will be presented at the bottom of the income statement to arrive at a new bottom line total indicating net income attributable to the consolidating parent company. Earnings per share will still be calculated on net income attributable to the consolidating parent company. Due to a change in our ownership level of BRI, we expect to deconsolidate this entity from our financial statements during the first quarter of 2009, and begin to account for it under the equity method at that time. As a result, we may record a gain or loss upon BRIs deconsolidation due to SFAS 160s requirement that we apply fair value to our equity interest. FASB Staff Position APB 14 1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14 1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14 1"). This FSP requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability and equity (conversion feature) components of the instruments. As a result, interest expense should be imputed and recognized based upon the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate, which will result in incremental non cash interest expense, and as result, lower net income. Our 2007 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes due July 30, 2013 will be subject to FSP APB 14 1. Prior to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 14, "Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants" ("APB 14"), provided that no portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the instrument should be attributable to the conversion feature. Our preliminary analyses have determined that if the liability and equity components of the Convertible Senior Notes had been separately valued at the time of their issuance on June 15, 2007, the amount allocated to long term debt would have been approximately $463 million, and the amount allocated to equity would have been approximately $112 million. When we are required to retroactively adopt FSP APB 14 1 in fiscal 2009, interest expense for fiscal 2007 and 2008 will be increased retrospectively by non cash amounts of approximately $9.0 million and $17.0 million, respectively. We anticipate recording additional non cash interest expense on the Convertible Senior Notes in 2009 through 2013 of approximately $18 million to $20 million annually, thereby increasing the carrying value of the debt to $575 million by its maturity date in July 2013. Further, we expect that the carrying amount of the 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes will be discounted (decreased) and additional paid in capital increased by approximately $86 million as of December 29, 2008. FASB Staff Position FASB 142 3 "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets" In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FASB 142 3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets" ("FSP FAS 142 3"). This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine recognized intangible asset under SFAS Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This FSP applies to recognized intangible assets that are accounted for pursuant to SFAS No. 142. For a recognized intangible asset, an entity will be required to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to assess the extent to which expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entitys intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. We do not believe the adoption of FSP FAS 142 3 will have a significant impact on our financial statements. 67 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions Transactions with Management and Others We employed members of the Coors and Molson families, who collectively owned 86% of the class A shares, common and exchangeable, of the Company throughout 2008. Hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit, and compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the Company. As of December 28, 2008, the Molson Foundation and other entities controlled by the Molson family collectively owned 43% of our Class A common and exchangeable stock, approximately 3% of our Class B common and exchangeable stock. As of December 28, 2008, various Coors family trusts collectively owned approximately 43% of our Class A common and exchangeable stock, approximately 12% of our Class B common and exchangeable stock. Certain Business Relationships See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 3 "EQUITY INVESTMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our significant related party transactions.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, and the prices of production and packaging materials. We have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We also use derivatives for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are the Canadian dollar ("CAD") and the British pound sterling ("GBP"). Derivatives are either exchange traded instruments or over the counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on over the counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over the counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (Standard & Poors) or A2 (Moodys). In some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with our counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. At December 28, 2008, no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us. Details of all other market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, including their fair values, are included in the table below. These instruments include long term fixed rate debt, foreign 68 Table of Contents currency forwards, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, and cross currency swaps. See related value at risk and sensitivity analysis in the Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments section of Item 7.

The bond forward transaction effectively established, in advance, the yield of the government of Canada bond rates over which the Companys private placement was priced. At the time of the private placement offering and pricing, the government of Canada bond rates was trading at a yield lower than that locked in with the Companys interest rate lock. This resulted in a loss of $4.0 million on the bond forward transaction. Per FAS 133 accounting, the loss will be amortized over the life of the Canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the Companys effective cost of borrowing by 4.9 basis points compared to the stated coupon on the issue. Simultaneously with the U.S. private placement we entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire USD $300.0 million issue amount and for the same maturity. In this transaction we exchanged our $300.0 million for a CAD $355.5 million obligation with a third party. The terms of the transaction are such that the Company will pay interest at a rate of 4.28% to the third party on the amount of CAD $355.5 million and will receive interest at a rate of 4.85% on the $300.0 million amount. There was an exchange of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction. We have designated this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated with the payment of interest and principal on the USD securities. Consistent with FAS 133 accounting, all changes in the value of the transaction due to foreign exchange will be recorded through the statement of operations and will be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument. Changes in the value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive income. (2)The BRI joint venture is a party to interest rate swaps, converting CAD $100.0 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2011. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. These interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment. (3)We are a party to certain cross currency swaps totaling GBP &pound;530.0 million (approximately USD $774 million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in 2002, the year we entered into the swaps). The swaps included an initial exchange of principal in 2002 and will require final principal exchange on the settlement date of our 63/8% notes due in 2012 (See Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 18 "DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed USD interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid USD to a counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive USD. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. (4)On June 15, 2007, MCBC issued $575 million of 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes in a public offering discussed further in Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 Note 13 "DEBT AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 69  Table of Contents
