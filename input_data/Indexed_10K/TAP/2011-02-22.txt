ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of "we", "us" or "our" includes Molson Coors Brewing Company ("MCBC" or the "Company"), principally a holding company, and its operating subsidiaries: Coors Brewing Company ("CBC"), operating in the United States ("U.S.") until June 30, 2008 when MCBC and SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") combined the U.S. and Puerto Rico operations of their respective subsidiaries, CBC and Miller Brewing Company ("Miller"), and the results and financial position of U.S. operations, which had historically comprised substantially all of our U.S. reporting segment were, in all material respects, deconsolidated from MCBC prospectively upon formation of MillerCoors LLC ("MillerCoors"); Molson Coors Brewing Company (UK) Limited ("MCBC UK"), operating in the United Kingdom ("U.K."); Molson Coors Canada ("MCC"), operating in Canada; and our other entities. Any reference to "Coors" means the Adolph Coors Company prior to the 2005 merger with Molson Inc. (the "Merger"). Any reference to Molson Inc. or Molson means MCC prior to the Merger. Any reference to "Molson Coors" means MCBC after the Merger. Unless otherwise indicated, (a) all $ amounts are in U.S. Dollars ("USD"), (b) comparisons are to comparable prior periods, and (c) full year 2010 refers to the 52 weeks ended on December 25, 2010, full year 2009 refers to the 52 weeks ended on December 26, 2009, and full year 2008 refers to the 52 weeks ended on December 28, 2008. In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), we also present pretax and after tax "underlying income" and "underlying free cash flow", which are non GAAP measures and should be viewed as supplements to not substitutes for our results of operations presented under U.S. GAAP. Our management uses underlying income and free cash flow and underlying free cash flow as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that underlying income, free cash flow and underlying free cash flow performance are used by and are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they provide an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to special and non core items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure. We have provided reconciliations of all non GAAP measures to their nearest GAAP measure. Executive Summary 2010 Key Financial Highlights: 2010 was a year of good progress in building our brands, innovating, reducing costs, strengthening our balance sheet, and generating cash. We introduced new brands and value enhancing innovations in each of our businesses to drive the top line, exceeded our cost reduction targets for the year, and used a portion of our free cash flow to fund our pensions and reduce balance sheet risk. Highlights for 2010 include: Based on the strength of our brands, we achieved positive beer pricing in each of our major businesses, and we finished 2010 with encouraging share trends in Canada and the U.K., and with Coors Light, Blue Moon and Miller Lite in the U.S. Cost savings initiatives underpinned our financial performance, delivering $194 million of total reductions in 2010, which includes 42% of MillerCoors savings. 27 Table of Contents Despite challenging economic conditions in all our markets and continued input cost inflation, we grew net sales ahead of cost of goods sold per hectoliter. As a result, we increased gross margins and achieved double digit growth in operating and pretax income. We reported global income from continuing operations, net of tax of $668.1 million, 8.4% lower than a year ago and underlying after tax earnings of $666.9 million for 2010, 5.7% lower than a year ago, due to unusually low effective and underlying effective tax rates of 2% and 1%, respectively in 2009, versus 17% and 16%, respectively, in 2010. As a result, income from continuing operations per diluted share decreased 35 cents to $3.57 per diluted share and underlying income per diluted share decreased 25 cents to $3.56 per diluted share. However, 2010 income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 12.8% and underlying pretax income increased 10.6%, both driven by positive pricing and cost reductions. We generated cash flow from operating activities and underlying free cash flow of $749.7 million and $924.3 million, respectively, representing a 12.7% decrease from $858.3 million and a 26.8% increase from $729.0 million in 2009, respectively. One source of cash was proceeds from closing out the majority of our Fosters swap positions, which we had established in 2008. During 2010, we began the process of unwinding these swaps and related financial instruments, which we completed in 2011, yielding total net cash proceeds of approximately $51 million. Of this, we received $35 million in 2010 and $16 million in 2011. Regarding our uses of free cash flow, we made additional voluntary contributions to our U.K., Canada and MillerCoors pension plans in the fourth quarter totaling $285 million (including 42% of MillerCoors additional voluntary contribution), settled the highest risk indemnities related to our former Brazil business, bought the controlling interest in a brewing joint venture in China, and made selective investments in brands, innovation and systems across our company. Regionally: In Canada, the biggest brand news was that Coors Light became the best selling beer in the country. Also, we successfully leveraged our sponsorship of the Vancouver Winter Olympics early in the year, relaunched Molson Canadian, expanded Molson M into the Atlantic region, rolled out Rickards Dark nationally, and introduced Keystone Light in the Ontario and West regions. In the first half, we completed the Granville Island acquisition, further increasing our presence in the highly profitable above premium segment. These new brands, combined with the strength of Coors Light and the rejuvenated Molson Canadian brand, helped us grow our national market share nearly 1 percentage point. While Canada earnings before income taxes decreased approximately 2%, Canada underlying pretax income grew nearly 10% as a result of these achievements and favorable foreign exchange in 2010. Additionally, we signed a substantial contract brewing arrangement that will help us leverage our fixed costs beginning in the first half of 2011. In the U.S., MillerCoors exceeded its targets for cost reductions and achieved 2.3% growth in domestic net sales per hectoliter. MillerCoors maintained a strong pace of brand building and innovation work, including the Miller Lite Vortex Bottle and "Man Up" ad campaign, Coors Light and Miller Lite Home Draft, and the Aluminum Pint bottle, and Blue Moons artfully crafted messaging on television. As a result, Coors Light and Blue Moon gained share in 2010. Additionally, MillerCoors formed Tenth and Blake Beer Company, a company within a company to drive its craft and specialty beer brands. With these efforts, we led the growth of the U.S. craft beer segment with Blue Moon and significantly 28 Table of Contents improved our premium light share trends in the second half of the year. Despite a very challenging beer market, the MillerCoors team grew net income attributable to MillerCoors and underlying net income 25.4% and 21.9%, respectively, in 2010. Including equity adjustments, our U.S. segment earnings before income taxes and underlying pretax income grew 19.4% and 18.5%, respectively, for the year. The U.S. business also greatly increased its cash generation in 2010 as it moved past the investments needed to capture synergies. In the U.K., we continued to drive our value over volume strategy and increased net sales per hectoliter 10% in local currency, the fourth consecutive year of pricing growth for our U.K. business. We also added the Blue Moon and Singha brands and Corona and other Modelo brands to our U.K. portfolio. In addition, we established a long term contract brewing arrangement with Carlsberg to brew Tetley ale for the U.K. market beginning in 2011. Earnings before income taxes increased 5% while underlying pretax earnings declined 6.3% in local currency due to higher U.K. pension expense in 2010. If we exclude the increase in pension expense of $29.2 million, U.K. underlying pretax earnings would have increased more than 20% for 2010, driven by strong pricing and cost reductions. Our International team completed the joint venture with Sihai Brewing Company in China and signed a brewing and distribution agreement with Mahou San Miguel for Carling in Spain. The team also launched Coors Light in Russia and Vietnam. Corona and other Modelo brands will be added to our Japan portfolio commencing in 2011. 29  Table of Contents The following table highlights summarized components of our condensed consolidated summary of operations for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 28, 2008.
