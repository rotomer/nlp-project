ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsUnless otherwise noted in this report, any description of "we", "us" or "our" includes Molson Coors Brewing Company ("MCBC" or the "Company"), principally a holding company, and its subsidiaries: Molson Coors Canada ("MCC"), operating in Canada; Coors Brewing Company ("CBC"), operating in the United States ("U.S.") until June 30, 2008 when MCBC and SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") combined the U.S. and Puerto Rico operations of their respective subsidiaries, CBC and Miller Brewing Company ("Miller"), and the results and financial position of U.S. operations, which had historically comprised substantially all of our U.S. reporting segment were, in all material respects, deconsolidated from MCBC prospectively upon formation of MillerCoors LLC ("MillerCoors"); Molson Coors Brewing Company (UK) Limited ("MCBC UK"), operating in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the Republic of Ireland; Molson Coors International ("MCI") operating in various other countries; and our other non operating subsidiaries. Any reference to "Coors" means the Adolph Coors Company prior to the 2005 merger with Molson Inc. (the "Merger"). Any reference to Molson Inc. or Molson means MCC prior to the Merger. Any reference to "Molson Coors" means MCBC after the Merger.Unless otherwise indicated, (a) all $ amounts are in U.S. Dollars ("USD"), (b) comparisons are to comparable prior periods, and (c) 2011 refers to the 53 weeks ended on December 31, 2011, 2010 refers to the 52 weeks ended on December 25, 2010, and 2009 refers to the 52 weeks ended on December 26, 2009.MillerCoors follows a monthly reporting calendar. 2011, 2010 and 2009 refer to the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively.In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), we also present pre tax and after tax "underlying income", "underlying income per diluted share", "underlying effective tax rate", and "underlying free cash flow", which are non GAAP measures and should be viewed as supplements to not substitutes for our results of operations presented under U.S. GAAP. Our management uses underlying income, underlying income per diluted share, underlying effective tax rate and underlying free cash flow as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that underlying income, underlying tax rate and underlying free cash flow performance are used by and are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they provide an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to special and non core items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure. We have provided reconciliations of all non GAAP measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure.Executive Summary2011 Key Financial Highlights:Our focus in 2011 continued to be on the three pillars of our growth strategy: to grow profitably in our core businesses through brands and innovation; to grow in new and emerging markets; and when it meets our strict shareholder return criteria, to grow through mergers and acquisitions.In 2011, our primary focus remained on the first of these pillars as we continued to invest in our key brands and fill our innovation pipeline. Increased sales, pricing and underlying earnings tell us we are moving in the right direction. Highlights for 2011 include:Based on the strength of our brands, we achieved positive beer pricing in both the U.S. and Canada.The acquisition of Sharps Brewery Ltd. in the U.K. has gone well with the Doom Bar brand growing strongly and now in the top 3 among U.K. cask ale brands. In the MCI segment, MC Cobra India is also off to a solid start.Cost savings initiatives contributed to our financial performance, delivering $107 million of total reductions in 2011, which includes 42% of MillerCoors savings.As a result, we increased net sales, gross profit, operating income and underlying after tax income in 2011.Net income from continuing operations attributable to MCBC of $674.0 million, or $3.62 per diluted share, increased 0.9% from a year ago. Underlying after tax income of $701.5 million, or $3.76 per diluted share, increased 5.2% compared to 2010 due to higher sales volume, positive pricing, continued cost reductions, favorable foreign exchange and the benefit of an additional week in our 2011 fiscal calendar offset by higher commodity inflation and investments in MCI. Our underlying income excludes some special and other non 24Table of Contentscore gains, losses and expenses that net to a $46.7 million pre tax charge. The additional week in fiscal 2011 increased worldwide beer volume by approximately 0.3 million hectoliters and increased pre tax profit by approximately $9 million, which includes increased pre tax income in Canada of approximately $12 million and approximately $3 million of increased interest and overhead expenses in Corporate. 2011 worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 0.7% compared to 2010, primarily due to continued volume weakness in the U.S. and Canada while U.K. volume grew during the year. Additionally, total company net sales increased 8.0% due to positive pricing in the U.S. and Canada, international growth, foreign currency movements, and the benefit of an additional week in our 2011 fiscal calendar. We generated cash flow from operating activities of $868.1 million, representing a 15.8% increase from $749.7 million in 2010 and a 1.1% increase from $858.3 million in 2009, respectively. Underlying free cash flow in 2011 was $635.3 million compared to $924.3 million in 2010 and $729.0 million in 2009, representing decreases of 31.3% and 12.9%, respectively. These decreases were driven by lower net income, higher capital expenditures, and timing of working capital in 2011.We used free cash flow to repurchase 7.5 million Class B shares for $321.1 million, settled 25% of our cross currency swaps and extinguished $98.7 million of the outstanding liability, and we made a capital contribution to BRI of approximately $94 million, which eliminated our guarantee liability. These cash uses of more than $500 million strengthened our balance sheet, improved our debt ratios with the rating agencies, and reduced our share count at an attractive price.In the area of Corporate Social Responsibility, we were selected for inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which is the most recognized global benchmark of sustainability among global corporations. We were one of only six North American food and beverage companies chosen to be in this index.Regionally:In Canada, we grew volume and profit in the back half of the year through improved performance by Coors Light, Molson Canadian and our above premium portfolio, highlighted by the launch of Rickards Blonde and the expansion of Creemore and Granville Island to new markets. Our Canada team secured the key National Hockey League ("NHL") sponsorship property, which is adding visibility to our brands. We introduced Molson Canadian 67 Sublime and Miller Chill Lemon, and we expanded Molson Canadian 67 into Quebec and Molson M into Ontario and the West. 2011 income from continuing operations before income taxes and underlying pre tax income increased by 4.6% to $474.9 million and by 3.3% to $486.5 million, respectively, compared to 2010. Increased net pricing, the benefit from an additional week in 2011, lower general and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency were partially offset by input. The additional week in 2011 added approximately 0.140 million hectoliters of sales volume and $12 million to pre tax income.In the U.S., Coors Light outperformed the premium light segment in both share and average price, and became the second largest beer in the market. The Blue Moon brands continued to lead the craft beer segment with double digit volume growth. Leinenkugels also grew at a double digit rate. These brands drive the Tenth and Blake business, which is focused on our craft and import brands. MillerCoors introduced value driving innovations, including Coors Light Super Cold Activation, and expanded the Miller Lite aluminum pint, Leinenkugels Summer Shandy, Blue Moon seasonals and Batch 19 to new markets. Miller Lite performance, however, was a disappointment. 2011 equity income in MillerCoors increased 0.4% to $457.9 million, while underlying equity income in MillerCoors increased 2.4% to $480.1 million compared to 2010, driven by positive pricing, cost savings, favorable brand mix and lower marketing, general and administrative expense partially offset by lower sales volume and higher commodity inflation. MillerCoors reports on a regular calendar basis, so our U.S. segment did not have an extra week of results in 2011.In a very challenging U.K. beer market, we gained market share and in the first half of the year successfully completed a major SAP system implementation and then focused on brands and innovation in the second half, resulting in accelerated share performance. We acquired the Sharps Brewery and Doom Bar brand early in 2011, added the Modelo brands to our portfolio, and relaunched Carling and Coors Light in the second half of 2011. We introduced new aluminum bottles for Carling, Coors Light and Caffreys, and we had a limited launch of new brands Carling Chrome and Anime. Also in the second half of 2011, we initiated a multi year redevelopment program for our U.K. brewing network, which will support brand growth, innovation and operations efficiencies in the years ahead. 2011 income from continuing operations before income taxes and underlying pre tax income of $99.3 million and $101.5 million, respectively, represent increases of $4.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, compared to 2010, driven by higher sales volume, positive sales mix, especially the addition of the Modelo brands, and lower marketing, general and administrative expense partially offset by input inflation and lower net pricing. The U.K. 2011 results reflect 25Table of Contentsan insignificant pre tax profit impact from the additional week in 2011; however, the additional week added approximately 0.165 million hectoliters of sales volume to the 2011 results.Our approach to International organic growth within MCI is based upon disciplined market development, strong strategic partnerships and sound investment in our brands. Specifically in 2011, we expanded our Cobra partnership to include the Indian subcontinent, which now gives us global control of this promising premium brand. We entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Obolon CJSC for manufacturing and distribution of Carling in Ukraine, Eastern Europes second biggest beer market. This venture is off to a strong start. 2011 loss from continuing operations before income taxes and underlying pre tax loss increased by 29.6% to $33.3 million and by 31.3% to $32.3 million, respectively, compared to 2010. Increased marketing, sales and other investments in our priority international markets were partially offset by higher sales volume. The additional week in 2011 had insignificant impacts on both sales volume and pre tax loss.The following table highlights summarized components of our condensed consolidated summary of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010, and December 26, 2009.
