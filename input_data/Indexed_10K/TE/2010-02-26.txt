Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This Managements Discussion & Analysis contains forward looking statements, which are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Actual results may differ materially from those forecasted. Such statements are based on our current expectations, and we do not undertake to update or revise such forward looking statements, except as may be required by law. These forward looking statements include references to our anticipated capital expenditures, liquidity and financing requirements, projected operating results, future environmental matters, and regulatory and other plans. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are discussed under Risk Factors. TECO Energy, Inc. is a holding company, and all of its business is conducted through its subsidiaries. In this Managements Discussion & Analysis, we, our, ours and us refer to TECO Energy, Inc. and its consolidated group of companies, unless the context otherwise requires. OVERVIEW We are an energy related holding company with four businesses consisting of regulated electric and gas utility operations in Florida, Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas System (PGS), respectively; TECO Coal, which owns and operates coal production facilities in the Central Appalachian coal production region; and TECO Guatemala, which is engaged in electric power generation and distribution and energy related businesses in Guatemala. Our regulated utility companies, Tampa Electric and PGS, operate in the Florida market. Tampa Electric serves almost 667,000 retail customers in a 2,000 square mile service area in West Central Florida and has electric generating plants with a winter peak generating capacity of 4,719 megawatts. PGS, Floridas largest gas distribution utility, serves more than 334,000 residential, commercial, industrial and electric power generating customers in all of the major metropolitan areas of the state, with a total natural gas throughput of more than 1.4 billion therms in 2009. We also have two unregulated companies. TECO Coal, through its subsidiaries, operates surface and underground mines and related coal processing facilities in eastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia, producing metallurgical grade and high quality steam coals. Sales in 2009 were 8.7 million tons. TECO Guatemala, through its subsidiaries, owns a coal fired generating facility and has a 96% ownership interest in an oil fired peaking power generating plant, both under long term contracts with a regulated distribution utility in Guatemala. It also has a 24% ownership interest in Guatemalas largest distribution utility, Empresa El&eacute;ctrica de Guatemala (EEGSA), and in affiliated companies (in combination called DECA II), which provide, among other things, electricity transmission services, wholesale power sales to unregulated electric customers and engineering services. In December 2007, we sold TECO Transport, a dry bulk shipping company that had been a part of our business mix for many years. We used the cash from this sale to further our most important cash priorities, investing in our Florida utilities and reducing parent company debt. The sale of TECO Transport allowed us to accelerate the retirement of parent debt, improve our balance sheet and credit ratings and reduce our business risk profile. We have reduced parent and parent guaranteed debt from a peak level of $2.7 billion in 2002 to $1.3 billion at the end of 2009. This debt was incurred in connection with a series of major investments in unregulated domestic power generation facilities outside Florida in anticipation of a movement toward competitive energy. The investments were ultimately unsuccessful and resulted in substantial losses when we exited this business segment in 2004 and 2005. 2009 PERFORMANCE All amounts included in this Managements Discussion & Analysis are after tax, unless otherwise noted. In 2009, our net income and earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy were $213.9 million or $1.00 per share, compared to $162.4 million or $0.77 per share in 2008. Net income in 2009 included $15.8 million of restructuring charges, a $5.2 million write off of project development costs at Tampa Electric, primarily related to the Polk Unit 6 IGCC plant, a $3.8 million loss on student loan securities held at TECO Energy, and an $8.7 million net gain on the sale of TECO Guatemalas 16.5% interest in the Central American fiber optic telecommunications provider, Navega. Our non GAAP results in 2009, which exclude the charges and gains discussed above, were $1.08 on a per share basis, compared to $0.87 in 2008 (see the 2009 and 2008 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results tables). Our results in 2009 reflect the benefits of higher base rates at Tampa Electric and PGS effective in 2009, and improved margins at TECO Coal as a result of higher selling prices. At TECO Guatemala, results reflect the impact of extended unplanned outages at the San Jos&eacute; Power Station in the first half of 2009, the negative impact of lower Value Added 33 Table of Contents Distribution (VAD) tariffs at EEGSA, the Guatemalan distribution utility, and lower net income from the unregulated affiliated companies due to the sale of Navega in the first quarter (see the TECO Guatemala section). In 2008, our net income and earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy were $162.4 million or $0.77 per share, compared to $413.2 million or $1.97 per share in 2007. Net income in 2008 included a $21.6 million provision for taxes due to the repatriation of cash and investments from Guatemala, a $1.9 million charge associated with a regulatory settlement with the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) related to a dispute that arose in 2008 over the calculation of Tampa Electrics waterborne transportation disallowance over its five year life, and $2.6 million of favorable adjustments to income taxes and working capital related to the sale of TECO Transport. Our non GAAP results in 2008, which exclude the charges and gains discussed above, on a per share basis were $0.87 per share, compared to $1.07 in 2007, which excluded charges, gains and the benefits from the production of synthetic fuel (see the 2008 and 2007 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results tables). Our results in 2008 reflected the impact on Tampa Electric of lower customer and energy sales growth, and the impact on TECO Coal of higher production costs. Performance in 2008 benefited from improved results at PGS and TECO Guatemala (excluding the taxes on the repatriation of cash and investments), and lower parent interest expense as a result of our debt retirement actions. Net income attributable to TECO Energy in 2007 included the $149.4 million gain from the sale of TECO Transport, $16.3 million of costs related to the sale of TECO Transport, and $20.2 million of charges related to debt extinguishment/exchange transactions. TECO Transport and the production of synthetic fuel contributed $34.0 million and $52.6 million, respectively, or $0.41 per share collectively, to 2007 net income. In 2007, net income reflected a $14.3 million tax benefit recorded in discontinued operations related to the 2005 disposition of the Union and Gila River merchant power plants. In 2009, we focused on concluding the base rate proceedings at both utilities and completion of peaking generation capacity additions and rail unloading facilities at Tampa Electric. In July 2009, we announced restructuring actions as part of our response to the lower customer and energy sales growth in the current economic downturn, industry changes, and the overall need to maintain a lean and efficient organization. We restructured the organization to establish a single management team over the electric and gas divisions of Tampa Electric Company, and integrated operating and support functions. These actions have reduced our expected 2010 operations and maintenance expenses to slightly above 2008 levels, and are expected to largely offset the effects of lower growth than expected at the time of the base rate filing. We remain focused on supporting the growth of Tampa Electric and strengthening its capital structure through equity contributions from TECO Energy to Tampa Electric. Tampa Electric has ongoing capital requirements associated with reliably and efficiently serving its customer base. To accomplish our objectives of supporting Tampa Electrics growth and reducing parent debt, in 2007 we completed the sale of TECO Transport for $405 million of gross proceeds. The sale allowed us to accelerate the retirement in 2007 of almost $300 million of parent debt and $111 million of parent guaranteed debt. The accelerated debt retirement allowed us to deploy cash generated in 2008 to investment in Tampa Electric that otherwise would have been applied to debt reduction. OUTLOOK We remain focused on our long term goal of investing in and growing our Florida utility businesses, while generating cash and earnings from our other energy related businesses, TECO Coal and TECO Guatemala. Continued reduction of parent debt that remains from the unsuccessful merchant power investments made early in the last decade remains a priority as well. Important factors in our 2010 results will be the individual operating company factors discussed below. Tampa Electric and PGS are under a single management team with new organizational structures following the restructuring actions taken in the third quarter of 2009. These actions have reduced expected operations and maintenance expenses, excluding all FPSC approved recovery clauses, in 2010 to approximately 2008 levels to offset the approximately $40 million revenue shortfall that resulted from lower customer and energy sales growth than projected in their base rate cases. These actions are expected to enable the utilities to earn the authorized returns on equity set in their 2009 rate case decisions. Tampa Electric and PGS will have the full year benefit of the new base rates approved by the FPSC in 2009, and, effective Jan. 1, 2010, $25.7 million of rates approved in 2009 related to the five combustion turbines and the rail unloading facilities placed in service in 2009. The 2010 portion of the base rate revenues effective Jan. 1, 2010 are subject to refund pending the outcome of a hearing to be held by the FPSC in 2010 (see the Regulatory section). The forecast for Tampa Electric and PGS assumes normal weather for the full year. The outlook and timing for a Florida economic recovery remains uncertain due to high unemployment and a weak housing market. Some economists are forecasting a very slow recovery starting about the middle of 2010, while others are forecasting a flat economy for 2010. The forecast used by Tampa Electric and PGS assumes no recovery in customer growth in 2010 and a slight decline in energy sales due to lower 34 Table of Contents customer usage in response to the continued weak economy. The Florida housing market is not expected to start to recover until after a general economic recovery begins. Until the economy and housing markets start to improve, it is difficult to forecast when customer and related energy sales growth will resume. Excluding all FPSC approved recovery clauses, Tampa Electrics non fuel operation and maintenance expense is expected to decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of the restructuring actions taken in 2009. Depreciation expense is expected to increase from additions to facilities to serve customers; and interest expense is expected to increase due to higher long term debt balances associated with the construction program. Environmental Cost Recovery Clause related earnings are expected to increase due to the completion of the fourth, and final, nitrogen oxide (NOx) control project, which is expected to enter service in May. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) is expected to decrease significantly in 2010 due to the 2009 completion of the peaking generation units and the 2010 completion of the NOx control projects. In November 2009, the FPSC approved Tampa Electrics fuel cost recovery filing, which included full recovery of waterborne and rail transportation costs for the delivery of solid fuel. In 2010, customer and therm sales growth at PGS will be impacted by the uncertain timing of economic and housing market recoveries. Excluding all FPSC approved cost recovery clause related expenses, operation and maintenance expense is expected to decrease in 2010. Depreciation expense is expected to increase due to normal additions to facilities to serve customers. TECO Coal expects 2010 net income to increase over 2009 from higher contract selling prices. Total sales are expected to be in a range between 8.3 and 8.7 million tons in 2010, compared to 8.7 million tons in 2009. This lower level of expected production is in response to the current world wide market conditions for steam and metallurgical coal. The full expected sales of all products are currently contracted at an average selling price of approximately $75 per ton. In 2010, the sales mix is expected to be closer to historical averages of one third specialty coals (metallurgical, pulverized coal injection (PCI) and stoker) and two thirds utility steam coal. The fully loaded, all in cost of production is expected to be in a range between $65 and $69 per ton driven by lower diesel fuel costs offset by higher safety requirements, productivity that reflects the industry wide trend of increased inspections by state and federal agencies, and higher royalty costs and severance taxes due to the higher selling prices. Diesel fuel prices have been hedged for those contracts that do not have diesel price adjustments in the contract at average prices significantly below 2009 hedged levels. TECO Guatemala expects improved operating and financial performance at the San Jos&eacute; Power Station following the extended unplanned outages in 2009, and higher contract capacity payments, which are expected to increase as the 12 month rolling average capacity factor improves. Due to the unplanned outages in 2009, the 12 month rolling average contract availability for San Jos&eacute; Power Station fell below the required level, which caused the capacity payments to be reduced. Spot energy sales are expected to increase due to higher residual (#6 oil) oil prices, which is the fuel used by other generators. The dispatch price for some of the diesel generating resources in Guatemala, which use residual fuel oil, is above the dispatch price for the San Jos&eacute; Power Station, which includes the cost of coal plus a non fuel variable cost component. TECO Guatemala is currently in talks with the Guatemalan regulatory authorities regarding the five year extension of the power sales contract for the Alborada Power Station, which expires in September 2010. In August 2008, the Guatemalan regulatory body, CNEE, unilaterally reduced the distribution tariff (VAD) for EEGSA. TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC has served a Notice of Intent under the Dominican Republic Central America United States Free Trade Agreement (DR CAFTA) indicating its intent to file an arbitration claim against the Republic of Guatemala for damages to its EEGSA partnership interest as a result of the VAD decision. There have been hearings in the Guatemalan courts on EEGSAs actions, which have been resolved against EEGSA, and Iberdrola, EEGSAs largest investor, is in an international arbitration process under the bilateral trade agreement between Spain and Guatemala, but the issue with the VAD remains unresolved with no firm schedule to resolve this matter (see the TECO Guatemala section). The 2010 outlook for TECO Guatemala assumes that the VAD issue remains unresolved. These forecasts are based on our current assumptions described in each operating company discussion, which are subject to risks and uncertainties (see the Risk Factors section). Our priorities for the use of cash remain investment in the utility companies and reduction of parent debt. We expect to make additional equity contributions to Tampa Electric and PGS in 2010 to support their capital spending programs. Capital expenditures increased in 2009, primarily at Tampa Electric for equipment to control NOx emissions, peak load generating capacity expansion, installation of rail coal unloading facilities, compliance with the FPSC mandated transmission and distribution system storm hardening requirements, distribution system reliability improvement, and heat rate and capacity factor improvements to our coal fired units. We also invested in new mining equipment and continued development of mines at TECO Coal. We forecast capital expenditures of $305 million in 2010 at Tampa Electric and to remain at about that level for the next several years. This level of capital spending will allow Tampa Electric to meet generation plant maintenance and the expected resumption of customer growth. It will also allow for distribution system improvements to provide higher reliability and for expansion of its transmission system. We also plan to invest in modest distribution system expansion at PGS, and normal maintenance capital and regulatory compliance at TECO Coal in 2010 (see the Liquidity, Capital Resources section). Due to the slow down in the Florida economy in 2008 and 2009 and a lower near term growth outlook, this forecast excludes any base load generating capacity additions, which were previously forecasted for the 2013 period. It also excludes any amounts for investments in renewable energy sources, which could be required under certain legislative proposals at the state and federal levels. 35 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY Since July 2006, we have provided two measures to allow comparison of our results with and without synthetic fuel. They are non GAAP results from continuing operations including benefits from the production of synthetic fuel (Non GAAP Results With Synthetic Fuel), which exclude certain charges and gains, but include synthetic fuel benefits or costs, and non GAAP results excluding synthetic fuel (Non GAAP Results Excluding Synthetic Fuel), which exclude charges, gains and benefits associated with the production of synthetic fuel (see the Non GAAP Information section). Although, with the expiration of the synthetic fuel tax credits at the end of 2007, we no longer produce synthetic fuel, we are continuing to provide both non GAAP measures for historical comparison purposes. The table below compares our GAAP net income to our non GAAP measures. A reconciliation between GAAP net income and the two non GAAP measures is contained in the Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results tables included for each year. A non GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure that includes or excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including or excluding amounts, that are excluded or included from the most directly comparable GAAP measure (see the Non GAAP Information section). Results Comparisons (millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net income attributable to TECO Energy $ 213.9 $ 162.4 $ 413.2 Net income attributable to TECO Energy before discontinued operations $ 213.9 $ 162.4 $ 398.9 Non GAAP results with synthetic fuel $ 230.0 $ 183.3 $ 276.3 Non GAAP results excluding synthetic fuel $ 230.0 $ 183.3 $ 223.7 In 2009, net income and earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy were $213.9 or $1.00 per share compared to $162.4 million or $0.77 per share in 2008. In 2007, net income and earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy were $413.2 million or $1.97 per share, which included the gain on the December 2007 sale of TECO Transport. Our non GAAP results in 2009, which exclude charges and gains, were $230.0 million, or $1.08 on a per share basis, compared to our 2008 non GAAP results of $183.3 million, or $0.87 on a per share basis. Non GAAP results in 2007 were $223.7 million or $1.07 on a per share basis (see the 2009 and 2008 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results tables). TECO Transport and the production of synthetic fuel contributed $34.0 million and $52.6 million, respectively, or $0.41 per share collectively, to 2007 net income. Compared to 2008, our results in 2009 reflected higher earnings at both of the regulated utilities, Tampa Electric and PGS, and at TECO Coal and lower earnings from TECO Guatemala. In 2009, our net income and earnings per share were reduced by a net $16.1 million, or $0.08 per share, of charges and gains, primarily related to restructuring actions and the write off of project development costs at Tampa Electric. In 2008 our net income and earnings per share were reduced by $21.6 million and $0.10 per share, respectively, for income taxes related to the repatriation of cash and investments from TECO Guatemala, of which $9.6 million was recognized by TECO Guatemala and $12.0 million by TECO Energy parent. For 2007, as a result of the sale transaction, results at TECO Transport were included only through Dec. 3, 2007. Net income and earnings per share were $413.2 million or $1.97 per share in 2007, and included the $149.4 million gain and the $16.3 million of costs related to the sale of TECO Transport, and $20.2 million of charges related to the debt extinguishment/exchange transactions completed in December. Net income and earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy before discontinued operations were $316.7 million or $1.51 per share in 2007, and reflected a $14.3 million tax benefit recorded in discontinued operations in the second quarter as a result of reaching a favorable conclusion with taxing authorities related to the 2005 disposition of the Union and Gila River merchant power plants. TECO Transport was not classified as a discontinued operation due to its ongoing contractual relationship with Tampa Electric for solid fuel waterborne transportation services. Results in 2007 included a $52.6 million, or $0.25 per share, benefit to earnings from synthetic fuel production (see the TECO Coal section). 36 Table of Contents 2009 Earnings Summary (millions) Except per share amounts 2009 2008 2007 Consolidated revenues $ 3,310.5 $ 3,375.3 $ 3,536.1 Earnings per share basic Earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy $ 1.00 $ 0.77 $ 1.97 Discontinued operations 0.07 Earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy before discontinued operations $ 1.00 $ 0.77 $ 1.90 Earnings per share diluted Earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy $ 1.00 $ 0.77 $ 1.96 Discontinued operations 0.07 Earnings per share attributable to TECO Energy before discontinued operations $ 1.00 $ 0.77 $ 1.89 Net income attributable to TECO Energy $ 213.9 $ 162.4 $ 413.2 Net income from discontinued operations (14.3 ) Charges and (gains) from continuing operations (1) 16.1 20.9 (122.6 ) Non GAAP results with synthetic fuel (2) 230.0 183.3 276.3 Synthetic fuel impact (1) (52.6 ) Non GAAP results excluding synthetic fuel (2) $ 230.0 $ 183.3 $ 223.7 Average common shares outstanding Basic 211.8 210.6 209.1 Diluted 213.1 211.4 209.9 (1) See the GAAP to non GAAP reconciliation tables that follow.

NON GAAP INFORMATION From time to time, in this Managements Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we provide non GAAP results, which present financial results after elimination of the effects of certain identified gains and charges. We believe that the presentation of this non GAAP financial performance provides investors a measure that reflects the companys operations under our business strategy. We also believe that it is helpful to present a non GAAP measure of performance that clearly reflects the ongoing operations of our business and allows investors to better understand and evaluate the business as it is expected to operate in future periods. Management and the Board of Directors use this non GAAP presentation as a yardstick for measuring our performance, making decisions that are dependent upon the profitability of our various operating units and in determining levels of incentive compensation. The non GAAP measure of financial performance we use is not a measure of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered an alternative to net income or other GAAP figures as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity. Our non GAAP presentation of results may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. While none of the particular excluded items is expected to recur, there may be adjustments to previously estimated gains or losses related to the disposition of assets or additional debt extinguishment activities. We recognize that there may be items that could be excluded in the future. Even though charges may occur, we believe the non GAAP measure is important in addition to GAAP net income for assessing our potential future performance, because excluded items are limited to those that we believe are not indicative of future performance. OPERATING RESULTS This Managements Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations utilizes TECO Energys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and separate non GAAP measures to analyze the financial condition of the company. Our reported operating results are affected by a number of critical accounting estimates such as those involved in our accounting for regulated activities, asset impairment testing and others (see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section). 38 Table of Contents The following table shows the segment revenues, net income and earnings per share contributions from continuing operations of our business segments on a GAAP basis (see Note 14 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements).

(6) The number of shares used in the earnings per share calculations is basic shares. TAMPA ELECTRIC Electric Operations Results Net income in 2009 was $160.2 million, compared to $135.6 million in 2008. Tampa Electrics full year non GAAP results were $176.7 million, which excluded $11.3 million of restructuring charges and the $5.2 million write off of project development costs primarily related to the Polk Unit 6 IGCC plant, compared to non GAAP results of $137.5 million in 2008, which excluded the $1.9 million waterborne transportation settlement (see the 2009 and 2008 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results table). 39 Table of Contents Pretax base revenues increased approximately $72 million in 2009 from the higher base rates approved by the FPSC for Tampa Electric effective May 7, 2009. In the 2009 full year period, there was no reduction in net income due to the waterborne transportation disallowance for the transportation of solid fuel, compared to an $8.9 million reduction in the 2008 period. The higher 2009 base revenues were partially offset by lower retail energy sales and higher operations and maintenance, depreciation, property tax and interest expense. Results reflect 1.1% lower retail energy sales in 2009, primarily due to lower sales to commercial and industrial customers as a result of the weak Florida economy, and voluntary conservation by residential customers, which we believe was in response to the generally weaker economic conditions. Off system sales declined due to lower state wide demand. Total heating and cooling degree days were 4% above normal and 10% above 2008 levels. The average number of retail customers decreased 0.1% for the year. In 2009, excluding all FPSC approved cost recovery clause related expenses, restructuring charges and the Polk 6 write off, operations and maintenance expense increased $8.7 million, compared to 2008, primarily due to $2.1 million higher spending on generating unit maintenance and repairs, $1.7 million higher expenses to operate the distribution system, $3.0 million higher employee related expenses, and $0.4 million higher bad debt expense. These increases were partially offset by savings in salaries and other benefits as a result of the restructuring actions taken in 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.1 million reflecting additional facilities to serve customers. Interest expense increased due to higher long term debt balances, and interest income decreased due to lower interest rates on lower under recovered fuel balances. Net income also included $9.3 million of AFUDC equity related to the construction of the peaking generation units, rail coal unloading facilities and the installation of NOx pollution control equipment, compared to $6.3 million in 2008. In 2008, net income was $135.6 million, compared to $150.3 million in 2007. Tampa Electrics 2008 non GAAP results were $137.5 million, which excluded a $1.9 million charge related to the settlement with the FPSC related to a dispute that arose in 2008 over the calculation of Tampa Electrics waterborne transportation disallowance over its five year life (see the 2008 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results table). These results were driven primarily by lower retail energy sales, higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher earnings on emissions control equipment recovered through the Environmental Cost Recovery Clause (ECRC) (see the Environmental Compliance section), and slightly lower operation and maintenance and property tax expense. These results reflect retail energy sales 2.8% lower than in 2007. The average number of retail customers increased 0.1% for the year, which was significantly lower than in prior years, as a result of the slowdown in the Florida economy and housing market. Total heating and cooling degree days were 5% below normal and 8% below 2007 levels. In 2008, excluding all FPSC approved cost recovery clause related expenses, operation and maintenance expense decreased $0.8 million, compared to 2007, primarily due to $4.0 million higher spending on generating unit maintenance and repairs and $0.8 million higher bad debt expense, more than offset by $4.2 million lower employee related expenses and other smaller cost reductions totaling $0.6 million in aggregate. Property tax expense decreased $0.7 million reflecting adjustments to property valuations agreed to with taxing authorities. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.3 million reflecting additional facilities to serve customers. Interest expense increased $1.5 million due to higher interest rates, and interest income decreased $2.9 million due to lower under recovered fuel balances. Net income also included $6.3 million of AFUDC equity related to the construction of the peaking generation units and the installation of NOx pollution control equipment, compared to $4.5 million in 2007. Base Rates Because of lower customer growth, slower energy sales growth, and ongoing high levels of capital investment, Tampa Electrics 13 month average regulatory ROE was 8.7% at the end of 2008, and 9.2% at the end of 2009. We made cash equity contributions totaling $292 million to Tampa Electric to strengthen its capital structure and to support its capital program in 2008. Due to the significant decline in ROE, Tampa Electric filed for a $228 million base rate increase in August 2008. In March 2009, the FPSC awarded a $104 million higher revenue requirements effective in May 2009 that authorized an ROE mid point of 11.25%, 54.0% equity in the capital structure, and 2009 13 month average rate base of $3.4 billion. A component of that decision was a $34 million 2010 base rate increase associated with the five peaking combustion turbines (CTs) and the solid fuel rail unloading facilities at the Big Bend Power Station scheduled to enter service before the end of 2009. In July, in response to a motion for reconsideration, the FPSC determined that adjustments to the capital structure used to calculate the new rates should have been calculated over all sources of capital rather than only investor sources. This change resulted in $9.3 million higher revenue requirements in 2009. At the same time the FPSC voted to reject the intervenors joint motion requesting reconsideration of the 2010 portion of base rates approved in 2009. In September 2009, the intervenors filed a joint appeal to the Florida Supreme Court related to the FPSCs decision to reject their motion for reconsideration of the 2010 portion of base rates approved in 2009. The FPSC and Tampa Electric will oppose this appeal. The intervenors filed appellate briefs on Feb. 24, 2010. There is no specific time frame for a resolution. 40 Table of Contents In December 2009, the FPSC approved Tampa Electrics petition requesting that the proposed rates to support the CTs and rail unloading facilities be put into effect Jan. 1, 2010. At that time, the FPSC determined that, based on its staff audit of the actual costs incurred, the 2010 portion of the base rates approved in 2009 should be reduced by $8.3 million to $25.7 million, subject to refund. A regulatory proceeding will be held during 2010 regarding the continuing need for the CTs, the appropriate amount to be recovered and the resulting rates. Pending final FPSC approval, the hearing is tentatively set for the first week of September.

Off system sales declined due to lower state wide demand. Total heating and cooling degree days were 4% above normal and 10% above 2008 levels. The average number of retail customers decreased 0.1% for the year. Pretax base revenues increased approximately $72 million in 2009 from the higher base rates approved by the FPSC, which were effective in May 2009. In 2008, retail megawatt hour sales declined 2.8%, which resulted in a $19.0 million reduction in base revenue, due to milder than normal weather and voluntary conservation by customers, which we believe to be in response to the generally weaker economic conditions. Total heating and cooling degree days were 5% below normal and 8% below 2007 levels. For the past three years, weather normalized energy consumption per residential customer declined due to the combined effects of voluntary conservation efforts, residential vacancies and changes in appliance efficiency. It is now apparent that some of the robust residential customer growth in the 2005 through mid 2007 period, which was measured by new meter installations, was actually vacant residences with minimal energy usage. The average number of residential customers with minimal usage was approximately 8% of total residential customers in both 2009 and 2008. Electricity sales to the phosphate industry decreased 6.5% in 2009, following a 7.7% decrease in 2008. The decline in sales to phosphate customers was partially attributable to planned outages at their production facilities as the producers managed their product inventory levels during the economic downturn. Base revenues from phosphate sales represented less than 3% of base revenues in 2009 and less than 2% in 2008. Sales to commercial customers decreased 2.0% in 2009, reflecting the weaker local economy. 41 Table of Contents Fuel related rates decreased in both 2009 and 2008, after an increase in 2007 under the FPSC approved fuel cost recovery clause. In March 2009, Tampa Electric filed to lower the fuel component of the customers bill due to an over recovery of fuel costs in 2008 and projected lower fuel costs in 2009. The March 2009 decrease was due to an over recovery of fuel costs in the final quarter of 2008 from lower natural gas prices than previously forecast and a forecast for continued lower natural gas prices for the remainder of 2009 (see the Regulation section). Energy sold to other utilities for resale decreased 50.2% in 2009 primarily due to lower energy demand state wide and to lower natural gas prices through much of the summer, which made Tampa Electrics base load coal generation not the lowest cost form of energy for spot sales. Energy sold to other utilities for resale decreased 2.3% in 2008, due to lower coal unit availability in the first six months of the year. Customer and Energy Sales Growth Forecast The outlook and timing for a Florida economic recovery remains uncertain due to high unemployment and the weak housing market. Some economists are forecasting a very slow recovery starting about the middle of 2010, while others are forecasting a flat economy for 2010. The forecast used by Tampa Electric reflects no customer growth in 2010 and a slight decline in energy sales due to lower customer usage in response to the continued weak economy. The actual average number of customers declined 0.1% in 2009. There was an increase in the average number of customers in the fourth quarter of 2009, the first such increase in 18 months. Actual average 2008 customer growth was 0.1% reflecting customer growth early in the year that was partially offset by a decline in the number of customers in the last quarter. Until unemployment starts to decline and the economy and housing markets start to improve, it will be difficult to forecast when customer and related energy sales growth will resume (see the Risk Factors section). Longer term, assuming an economic recovery, and that growth from population increases and business expansion will resume, Tampa Electric expects average annual customer growth to return to a level of nearly 1.5% and weather normalized average retail energy sales growth at about that same level in the 2011 or 2012 time frame. This energy sales growth projection is lower than previous projections, reflecting changes in usage patterns and changes in population trends. Tampa Electric forecasts that summer retail peak demand growth will be minimal over the next three years, but peak load growth will resume after 2013. These growth projections assume a resumption of local area economic growth, normal weather, a slow recovery in the housing market over time, and a continuation of the current energy market structure. The economy in Tampa Electrics service area contracted in 2009 and 2008 after modest growth in 2007. Initially, the contraction was centered in housing and related industries, but spread to the general economy later in 2007. The Tampa metropolitan areas employment decreased 5.1% in 2009 following a 2.7% decrease in 2008. This level of job loss is greater than statewide losses in Florida. The local Tampa area unemployment rate increased to 12.4% at year end 2009, compared with 8.3% at the end of 2008 and 4.7% in December 2007. The Tampa area year end 2009 unemployment rate was higher than the 11.8% unemployment rate for the state of Florida and higher than the 10.0% for the nation, which is contrary to the trends experienced in previous economic slowdowns. The more severe downturn in the Tampa area and Florida was initially driven by the sharp downturn in construction activity following the boom in the 2005 and 2006 periods, which has since spread to other housing related businesses and the economy in general. As in many areas of the country, the housing market in Tampa Electrics service area remained weak in 2009 with declining home prices for much of the year and a high number of foreclosures. This trend was a continuation of the weak housing markets of 2008 and 2007 initially driven by excess builder inventory, the curtailment of speculative investing and sub prime mortgage issues, and more recently by high unemployment and the tight mortgage lending markets. In the second half of 2009 there were some positive signals from the housing market in the form of increased sales of existing homes, increases in existing home resale prices in two of the last four months of 2009 as reported by the Case Shiller Home Price Index, and a modest increase in the number of new single family building permits. Economists and real estate associations indicate that the housing market is expected to remain weak at least through the first half of 2010 with a recovery possibly starting late in 2010, depending on the timing of a general economic recovery and the absorption of excess inventory. Operating Expenses Total pretax operating expense increased 3.5% in 2009, driven by higher other operating expenses and maintenance expenses, which included the write off of project development costs, the write off of disallowed rate case expenses, and restructuring costs. Excluding all FPSC approved cost recovery clause related expenses, restructuring charges and the project development write off, operations and maintenance expense increased $8.7 million, compared to 2008, primarily due to higher spending on generating unit maintenance and repairs, higher expenses to operate the distribution system, higher employee related expenses, and slightly higher bad debt expense, partially offset by savings in salaries and other benefits as a result of the restructuring actions taken in the third quarter. 42 Table of Contents Total pretax operating expense decreased 4.6% in 2008, driven by lower fuel expense and lower taxes other than income, including lower property taxes and sales related taxes and lower franchise fees. In 2008, excluding all FPSC approved cost recovery clause related expenses, operation and maintenance expense decreased $0.8 million, compared to 2007, primarily due to $4.0 million higher spending on generating unit maintenance and repairs and $0.8 million higher bad debt expense more than offset by $4.2 million lower employee related expenses, and $1.4 million of other smaller cost reductions. Property tax expense decreased $0.7 million, driven by adjustments to property valuations agreed to with taxing authorities. Tampa Electric expects operation and maintenance expense, excluding fuel and purchased power, to decrease to approximately 2008 levels in 2010. Excluding all FPSC approved recovery clauses, the 2010 non fuel operation and maintenance expense decrease is expected to be driven by the restructuring actions taken in 2009, and will better match expenditures to 2010 revenues, which reflect the current state of Floridas economy. In 2009, depreciation expense increased $9.1 million and taxes other than income were higher due to the peaking combustion turbines placed in service in 2009 and normal additions to facilities to serve customers. Depreciation expense increased $4.3 million in 2008, reflecting additional facilities to serve customers. Depreciation expense is projected to increase in 2010 due to routine plant additions to serve Tampa Electrics customer base and maintain system reliability, a full year of depreciation on combustion turbines that were placed in service at various times in 2009, the addition of solid fuel rail unloading facilities in late 2009 and a partial year of depreciation on the fourth and final NOx control project, which is expected to enter service in May 2010. Fuel Prices and Fuel Cost Recovery In November 2008, the FPSC approved Tampa Electrics originally requested 2009 fuel rates. The rates included the costs for natural gas and coal expected in 2009, and the recovery of fuel and purchased power expenses, which were not collected in 2008. In March 2009, Tampa Electric filed a mid course correction with the FPSC to adjust its projected 2009 fuel and purchased power costs to reflect the decline in commodity fuel prices, primarily natural gas. The revised forecast reduced fuel and purchased power costs by $191 million for 2009, which when combined with $35 million over recovery in late 2008, resulted in $226 million lower projected fuel and purchased power cost. (see the Regulation section). In November 2009, the FPSC approved cost recovery rates for fuel and purchased power, capacity, environmental and conservation costs for the period January through December 2010. The rates include the expected cost for natural gas and coal in 2010, the net over recovery of fuel, purchased power and capacity clause expenses, which were collected in 2009 following the March adjustment, and the operating cost for and a return on the capital invested in the fourth SCR project to enter service at the Big Bend Power Station as well as the operation and maintenance expense associated with the projects (see the Regulation and Environmental Compliance sections). Total fuel cost increased in 2009, due to higher cost for coal partially offset by lower costs for natural gas. Purchased power decreased in 2009 due to lower natural gas prices, which is the primary fuel used by other generators in Florida. Average delivered coal and natural gas prices moved in opposite directions in 2009. Natural gas prices decreased 24.6% in 2009 due to storage inventories above historic averages resulting from lower demand for natural gas from industrial users caused by the economic recession, and increased supply of low cost gas from domestic sources. Coal costs increased 4.8% in 2009 due to contracts signed in 2008 for deliveries in 2009 when coal prices were higher. Coal and natural gas prices were $3.05 per million BTU (/mmBTU) and $8.00/mmBTU, respectively, in 2009. Total fuel prices decreased in 2008, but purchased power increased due to lower generation from natural gas fired facilities. Average delivered coal and natural gas prices increased 13.0% and 11.4%, respectively, to $2.91/mmBTU and $10.61/mmBTU, respectively, in 2008. Natural gas futures as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and various forecasts for natural gas prices indicate that natural gas prices will increase in 2010 from the unusually low 2009 levels. Coal prices, while less volatile, decreased in 2009 after sharp increases in 2008 and 2007. Coal prices experienced a significant decline in 2009 for spot or as needed purchases, due to lower demand for coal fired generation of electricity as a result of the economic conditions. Tampa Electrics primary coal supplies are from the Illinois Basin, which experienced an upward movement in prices in 2008 but not of the same magnitude as prices in the Central Appalachian coal producing region. Tampa Electrics coal prices are expected to remain stable in 2010 due to longer term supply contracts signed in 2008. Energy Supply On a retail energy supply basis, Tampa Electric generation accounted for 98%, 94% and 93% of the total retail energy sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, with the remainder of the energy supplied by purchased power. Purchased power expense decreased 41.8% due to the lower per unit prices associated with the purchases as a result of lower natural gas prices and lower volumes purchased primarily due to lower demand and improved coal fired unit availability during the high load summer period. Purchased power expense is expected to decrease in 2010 due to a lower volume of purchases driven by only one planned outage for the final SCR installation compared to multiple SCR outages in 2009. 43 Table of Contents Prior to 2003, nearly all of Tampa Electrics generation was from coal. Starting in April 2003, the mix started to shift with increased use of natural gas at the Bayside Power Station, which was converted from the coal fired Gannon Station. In 2009, at times it was more cost effective to generate electricity from natural gas than from coal due to the low natural gas prices. Nevertheless, coal is expected to continue to represent more than half of Tampa Electrics fuel mix due to the baseload units at the Big Bend Power Station and the coal gasification unit, Polk Unit One. In 2010, the final Big Bend Power Station coal fired unit will undergo an extensive outage to complete the construction of the NOx control equipment (see the Environmental Compliance section), which is expected to reduce the generation from coal from that unit. Anticipated higher natural gas prices in 2010 are expected to increase the use of coal for generation. Hurricane Storm Hardening Due to extensive storm damage to utility facilities during the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons and the resulting outages utility customers experienced throughout the state, in 2006 the FPSC initiated proceedings to explore methods of designing and building transmission and distribution systems that would minimize long term outages and restoration costs related to severe weather. The FPSC subsequently issued an order requiring all investor owned utilities (IOUs) to implement a 10 point storm preparedness plan designed to improve the statewide electric infrastructure to better withstand severe storms and expedite recovery from future storms. Tampa Electric implemented its plan in 2007 and estimates the average non fuel operation and maintenance expense of this plan to be approximately $20 million annually for the foreseeable future. The FPSC also modified its rule regarding the design standards for new and replacement transmission and distribution line construction, including certain critical circuits in a utilitys system. Future capital expenditures required under the storm hardening program are expected to average more than $20 million annually for the foreseeable future (see the Regulation section). Capital Spending For the past several years, Tampa Electric was in a period of increased capital spending for infrastructure to reliably serve its customer base and for peaking generating capacity additions. In addition to the capital spending to comply with the storm hardening plan described above, Tampa Electric expects to make additional capital investments in its transmission and distribution system to improve reliability and reduce customer outages, and for generating unit reliability. Due to the dramatic slowdown in the Florida and national economies and the Florida housing market in 2008 and 2009, Tampa Electric has reassessed its forecast of long term energy demand and sales growth. Tampa Electric had previously identified a need for new baseload capacity in early 2013; however, the current capital forecast reflects a deferral of construction of new baseload or peaking capacity beyond this forecast period. If growth resumes and demand increases above the current projections, Tampa Electric may require peaking capacity in the 2013 time frame. Tampa Electric may seek to purchase power rather than build additional capacity based on the economics of a decision to purchase rather than build new capacity (see the Capital Expenditures and Regulation sections). Pending action by the Florida Legislature on a Florida renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS), the need for additional capital spending on renewable energy sources is likely but not yet defined (see the Environmental Compliance section). Depending on the final rules, which the legislature may enact in the 2010 legislative session, Tampa Electric may need to invest capital to develop additional sources of renewable power generation. PEOPLES GAS (PGS) Operating Results PGS reported net income of $31.9 million in 2009, compared to $27.1 million in 2008. Non GAAP results, which exclude $2.9 million of restructuring charges, were $34.8 million in 2009 (see the 2009 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results table). There were no non GAAP adjustments to the 2008 period. The higher 2009 results reflect a $4.0 million favorable adjustment to previously recorded deferred tax balances, and the new base rates effective in June, partially offset by higher non fuel operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation. Results reflect a 0.2% lower average number of customers. Residential customer usage increased due to colder winter weather in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the very mild winter weather in 2008. Sales to commercial customers increased, due to several higher volume new customers and conversion of propane customers to natural gas. Lower sales volumes to industrial customers reflected economic conditions and reduced operations by industries sensitive to the housing market, such as cement plants. Gas transported for power generation customers increased over 2008 due to lower natural gas prices, which made it a more economical generating fuel choice. Excluding restructuring charges, non fuel operations and maintenance expense increased in 2009 compared to 2008 when operations and maintenance expense was reduced by a $1.5 million benefit from the recognition of environmental remediation insurance recoveries and a $0.9 million benefit related to the completion of pipeline installations for power generation customers. PGS experienced higher pipeline integrity costs and higher depreciation expense in 2009 due to routine plant additions. 44 Table of Contents In 2009, the total throughput for PGS was 1.4 billion therms. Industrial and power generation customers consumed approximately 50% of PGS annual therm volume, commercial customers used approximately 26%, approximately 19% was sold off system, and the balance was consumed by residential customers. PGS reported net income of $27.1 million in 2008, compared to $26.5 million in 2007. Results reflected higher volumes for weather sensitive residential and small commercial customers due to colder than normal weather in the northern portion of Florida in the fourth quarter, which more than offset mild weather earlier in the year. Higher volumes transported for industrial customers and higher volumes for off system sales offset lower volumes for power generation customers. Average customer growth of 0.2% was a result of the continued weak Florida housing market. Therm sales to industrial customers increased due to two new customers with significant usage but at lower transportation rates, which partially offset lower volumes for other customers due to the economic conditions. Sales to commercial and industrial customers were impacted by the weak Florida housing market and overall weak economy, which reduced sales to customers such as restaurants and wallboard, asphalt and concrete producers. Results also reflect a $1.5 million benefit from the recognition of environmental remediation insurance recoveries, and a $0.9 million benefit related to the completion of pipeline installations for a power generation customer. In 2008, the total throughput for PGS was 1.4 billion therms. Industrial and power generation customers consumed approximately 45% of PGS annual therm volume, commercial customers used approximately 26%, approximately 23% was sold off system, and the balance was consumed by residential customers. Residential operations were about 30% of total revenues in 2009 due to lower natural gas prices. New residential construction that includes natural gas and conversions of existing residences to gas has slowed significantly due to the weak Florida housing market. Like most other natural gas distribution utilities, PGS is adjusting to lower per customer usage due to improving appliance efficiency. As customers replace existing gas appliances with newer, more efficient models, per customer usage tends to decline. Natural gas has historically been used in many traditional industrial and commercial operations throughout Florida, including production of products such as steel, glass, ceramic tile and food products. Within the PGS operating territory, large cogeneration facilities utilize gas fired technology in the production of electric power and steam. The actual cost of gas and upstream transportation purchased and resold to end use customers is recovered through a Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA). Because this charge may be adjusted monthly based on a cap approved by the FPSC annually, PGS normally has a lower percentage of under or over recovered gas cost variances than Tampa Electric. Excluding restructuring charges, 2009 non fuel operations and maintenance expense increased $3.3 million compared to 2008 levels when operations and maintenance expense included a $1.5 million benefit from the recognition of environmental remediation insurance recoveries and a $0.9 million benefit related to the completion of pipeline installations for power generation customers. Absent the 2008 benefits, operations and maintenance expense was essentially unchanged in 2009. In 2008, excluding costs recovered through the FPSC approved conservation clause, operation and maintenance expenses decreased $1.2 million, driven primarily by a benefit to environmental remediation expenses discussed above and lower employee related expenses. Depreciation expense increased $1.1 million due to additions to facilities to serve customers. Because of lower customer growth, slower energy sales growth, higher levels of operations and maintenance spending, continued investment in the distribution system and higher costs associated with required safety requirements, such as transmission and distribution pipeline integrity management, PGS 13 month average regulatory ROE was below the bottom of its allowed range at the end of 2007 and was 8.7% at the end of 2008. Due to the significant decline in ROE, PGS filed for a $26.5 million base rate increase in August 2008. In May 2009, the FPSC awarded a $19.2 million revenue requirements increase that authorized an ROE mid point of 10.75%, 54.7% equity in the capital structure, and 2009 13 month average rate base of $561 million. The new rates were effective Jun. 18, 2009. 45 Table of Contents Summary of Operating Results (millions) 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Revenues $ 470.8 (31.6 ) $ 688.4 14.8 $ 599.7 Cost of gas sold 244.5 (48.7 ) 476.6 22.2 389.9 Operating expenses 163.3 8.6 150.3 (0.4 ) 150.9 Operating income 63.0 2.4 61.5 4.4 58.9 Net income 31.9 17.7 27.1 2.3 26.5 Therms sold by customer segment Residential 73.5 (1.2 ) 74.4 6.1 70.1 Commercial 381.7 1.5 375.9 1.3 370.9 Industrial 448.7 (12.6 ) 513.3 4.8 489.8 Power generation 538.3 18.2 455.6 (3.4 ) 471.7 Total 1,442.2 1.6 1,419.2 1.2 1,402.5 Therms sold by sales type System supply 398.0 (13.1 ) 457.8 4.6 437.8 Transportation 1,044.2 8.6 961.4 (0.3 ) 964.7 Total 1,442.2 1.6 1,419.2 1.2 1,402.5 Customer (thousands) average 334.4 (0.2 ) 335.1 0.2 334.3 In Florida, natural gas service is unbundled for non residential customers that elect this option, affording these customers the opportunity to purchase gas from any provider. The net result of unbundling is a shift from bundled transportation and commodity sales to transportation sales. Because the commodity portion of bundled sales is included in operating revenues at the cost of the gas on a pass through basis, there is no net earnings impact to the company when a customer shifts to transportation only sales. PGS markets its unbundled gas delivery services to customers through its NaturalChoice program. At year end 2009, approximately 15,200 out of 31,400 of PGS eligible non residential customers had elected to take service under this program. Since early 2008 at the start of the housing market collapse, customer growth and therm sales growth have been difficult to forecast, due to the state of the national and Florida economies and the uncertainty of the timing of a recovery in the Florida housing market. In 2009, PGS had a lower average number of customers than in 2008. In 2008, PGS had forecast customer growth of approximately 1.0%; however, actual customer growth was 0.2%, which is significantly lower than the average customer growth experienced for the previous five years. PGS provides service in areas of Florida that experienced some of the most rapid growth in 2005 and 2006, including the Miami, Ft. Myers and Naples areas. These areas continue to experience the most significant impacts of the housing market collapse. In 2010, customer growth and therm sales growth at PGS will be impacted by the uncertain timing of economic and housing market recoveries. Excluding all FPSC approved cost recovery clause related expenses, operation and maintenance expense is expected to decrease in 2010 as a result of the 2009 restructuring. Depreciation expense is expected to increase from continued capital investments in facilities to reliably serve customers. Base rate relief was granted in 2009, which amounts to $19.2 million on an annualized basis effective in June 2009. Since its acquisition by TECO Energy in 1997, PGS has expanded its gas distribution system into areas of Florida not previously served by natural gas, such as the lower southwest coast in the Ft. Myers and Naples areas and the northeast coast in the Jacksonville area. In 2010, PGS expects its capital spending to support modest system expansion in anticipation that the Florida housing market will recover over the next several years. Over time, PGS expects customer additions and related revenues to increase, assuming an economic and housing market recovery throughout the state of Florida, and other factors (see the Risk Factors section). Gas Supplies PGS purchases gas from various suppliers depending on the needs of its customers. The gas is delivered to the PGS distribution system through three interstate pipelines on which PGS has reserved firm transportation capacity for delivery by PGS to its customers. Gas is delivered by the Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) through 59 interconnections (gate stations) serving PGS operating divisions. In addition, PGS Jacksonville Division receives gas delivered by the South Georgia Natural Gas Company pipeline through two gate stations located northwest of Jacksonville. PGS also receives gas delivered by Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline through seven gate stations. 46 Table of Contents PGS procures natural gas supplies using baseload and swing supply contracts with various suppliers along with spot market purchases. Pricing generally takes the form of either a variable price based on published indices, or a fixed price for the contract term. TECO COAL TECO Coal recorded net income of $37.2 million in 2009, more than double the $18.0 million in 2008, on sales of 8.7 million tons, compared to sales of 9.3 million tons in 2008. Lower volume and the sales mix in 2009 reflects coal market conditions, which included high inventory levels at utility steam coal customers and reduced demand for coal used in the production of steel. At almost $72 per ton, the 2009 full year average net per ton selling price was 20% above the 2008 average selling price. At almost $67 per ton, the 2009 all in total per ton cost of production was 14% higher than in 2008. In 2009, TECO Coals effective income tax rate was 17%. TECO Coal recorded net income of $18.0 million in 2008, compared to $90.9 million in 2007 on sales of 9.3 million tons, compared to 9.2 million tons, which included 6.0 million tons of synthetic fuel, in 2007. TECO Coals 2007 Non GAAP Results Excluding Synthetic Fuel, which excluded the $52.6 million benefit associated with the production of synthetic fuel, were $38.3 million (see the 2007 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results table). Results in 2008 reflected an average net selling price per ton across all products, which excluded transportation allowances, almost 7% higher than in 2007. Due to the signing of steam coal contracts for 2008 delivery during periods of lower prices in 2006 and 2007 and its 2008 metallurgical coal contracts early in the renewal cycle in late 2007, TECO Coal realized lower average prices per ton in 2008 than other coal producers realized from contracts signed during the period of very strong coal markets in 2008. The cash cost of production increased 14% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven by diesel oil prices that were 42% higher than 2007 prices, higher per ton costs for steel products used in underground mining, higher costs for explosives used in surface mining operations, and higher costs associated with contract miners. The cost of production in 2008 also reflected the industry wide issues of a shortage of qualified miners and lost productivity due to increased safety inspections, and difficult geology at several TECO Coal mines at various times during the year. Results also reflected a $2.6 million benefit from a contract settlement related to future coal sales, and a $0.6 million benefit from the true up of the 2007 synthetic fuel tax credit rate, compared to a $1.6 million benefit in 2007 for the true up of the 2006 rate. Net income in 2007 reflected $52.6 million of benefits from the production of synthetic fuel. The tax credit program for the production of synthetic fuel expired Dec. 31, 2007. TECO Coal Outlook We expect TECO Coals net income to increase in 2010 over 2009 from higher contract selling prices. TECO Coal expects sales to be in range between 8.3 and 8.7 million tons. The total expected sales are contracted and priced at an average price of more than $75 per ton. More than one third of sales are to steel producers and specialty stoker coal users with the remainder sold to utility steam coal customers. The all in, fully loaded production costs are expected to be in a range between $65 and $69 per ton, driven by lower diesel fuel costs offset by higher safety requirements, productivity that reflects the industry wide trend of increased inspections by state and federal agencies, and higher royalty cost and severance taxes due to the higher selling prices. Diesel fuel prices have been hedged for those contracts that do not have diesel price adjustments in the contract at average prices below 2009 levels. For the past several years, the issuance of permits by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act required for surface mining activities in the Central and Northern Appalachian mining regions have been challenged in the courts. These challenges have been appealed by various mining companies affected on a number of occasions, but very few permits have been issued over the past several years. TECO Coal has six permits on the list of permits subject to enhanced review by the U.S. EPA under its memorandum of understanding with the USACE, which was issued in September 2009. Production from a mine affected by one of those permits that has been delayed is included in the 2010 sales projections. This mine is expected to contribute approximately 3% of 2010 sales. To date, there has been no progress in granting these permits. TECO Coal is currently producing from other mines to offset the lost production from the delayed permit. Coal Markets Following the rapid increase in coal prices that started late in 2007, in the third quarter of 2008, in response to the U.S. economic recession, the prices for many commodities, which had previously experienced very strong and very volatile prices in 2008, started to drop. The decline in commodity prices, including coal, accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the spread of the U.S. economic recession to many other economies around the world. At that time, the U.S. steel industry, which is a large consumer of metallurgical coal, was reported to be operating at a less than 40% utilization rate. In the first half of 2009, coal producers around the world experienced generally depressed demand for their product, which resulted in lower shipments and lower prices. In the second half of 2009, government economic stimulus actions resulted in very strong demand for metallurgical coal in China and India. As the international economies started to emerge from the economic recession in late 2009, demand and 47 Table of Contents prices for metallurgical coal increased, both in the U.S. and in international markets. In February 2010, Coal industry newsletters reported that spot prices for high quality metallurgical coal were approaching $200 per metric ton delivered to the customer. Demand for coal used by utilities to generate electricity declined in 2009 due to the economic recession. Natural gas prices, as measured on a cent per million BTU basis, being below coal prices allowed utilities to substitute natural gas for coal in the generation of electricity. Further, demand for electricity, especially by industrial users across the country, decreased due to the recession. As a result, utility coal stockpiles were significantly above long term averages, which caused some utilities to defer contracted tons into future years and to not purchase coal in the spot markets as they normally would. All of these factors caused prices for utility steam coal, as measured by reported spot market prices, to drop below $50 per ton for coal from Central Appalachia in 2009, which is less than 50% of the 2008 levels. In 2010, cold weather early in the year, a recovery in electricity usage by industrial customers, higher natural gas prices, and the improving world economy may cause utilities to again seek new coal supplies, but probably not until the second half of 2010. The significant factors that could influence TECO Coals results in 2010 are the cost of production and the ability of customers to accept their full contracted volumes. Longer term factors that could influence results include inventories at steam coal users, weather, the ability to obtain environmental permits for mining operations, general economic conditions, the level of oil and natural gas prices, commodity price changes that impact the cost of production, and changes in environmental regulations (see the Environmental Compliance and Risk Factors sections). TECO GUATEMALA Our TECO Guatemala operations consist of two power plants operating in Guatemala under long term contracts and an ownership interest in DECA II, which has an ownership interest in Guatemalas largest distribution utility, Empresa El&eacute;ctrica de Guatemala (EEGSA) and affiliated energy related companies which provide, among other things, electricity transmission services, wholesale power sales to unregulated electric customers, and engineering services. The San Jos&eacute; and Alborada power stations in Guatemala both have long term power sales contracts. TECO Guatemalas effective 24% ownership interest in EEGSA is held jointly with partners Iberdrola Energia, S.A. of Spain (Iberdrola) and Electricidad of Portugal (EDP). Together, TECO Guatemala, Iberdrola and EDP own an 81% controlling interest in DECA II. TECO Guatemala has a 30% interest in DECA II. The Alborada Power Station, which consists of oil fired, simple cycle combustion turbines, is a peak load facility with high availability, but operates at a low capacity factor by design. Guatemala is heavily dependent on hydro electric sources for baseload power generation. The Alborada Power Station is under contract to EEGSA but it is designated to be an operating reserve for the country of Guatemala by the countrys power dispatcher. The plant runs at peak times or in times of loss of a major generating unit or transmission circuit in the country. In 2001, EEGSA and Alborada entered into an agreement (the Option) to extend the term of the Alborada power sales contract, which is scheduled to expire in September 2010, for five years at the end of the contract period. At the time of the execution of the Option (2001), the Guatemalan regulators expressly approved the pass through to the tariff of all costs associated with the extended term of the contract, however, even though Alborada is in compliance with all of the terms of the Option, the current Guatemalan regulator has objected to the extension citing modifications to regulations passed in 2007. Alborada is currently in talks with the Guatemalan government to extend this contract term. In Guatemala, the VAD charges applicable in the tariffs charged by EEGSA are normally reset for new five year terms. In the summer of 2008, the VAD was expected to be reset in a manner similar to the process utilized in 2003, in accordance with applicable Guatemalan law. On Jul. 25, 2008, the National Electric Energy Commission (CNEE), the Guatemalan regulatory body, issued a communication unilaterally disbanding the panel of experts appointed under existing regulations to review and approve the new VAD. EEGSA expected that the panels action was going to result in increased rates. On Aug. 1, 2008, CNEE issued resolutions setting new tariff rates for EEGSA, which deviated significantly from the rates calculated consistent with the panel of experts guidance. The VAD revenues resulting from the new rates are approximately 30% 40% below the prior level, essentially putting all of EEGSAs earnings, in which our subsidiary, TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC, (TGH) shares, which had previously averaged about $10 million annually, at risk during the time this tariff remains in effect. As a result of these actions, in January 2009, our subsidiary, TGH delivered a Notice of Intent to the Guatemalan government indicating its intent to file an arbitration claim against the Republic of Guatemala under the DR CAFTA. TGH continues to evaluate its options related to a DR CAFTA filing (see the Risk Factors section). In the normal course of business, TECO Guatemala evaluated its $146.7 million investment in DECA II, including associated goodwill at Dec. 31, 2009 and determined that the value was not impaired. However, the outcome of the ongoing efforts and a potential arbitration under a DR CAFTA claim is uncertain, and could impact this determination in the future (see Note 12 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). 48 Table of Contents EEGSA, Iberdrola, EEGSAs largest investor, and EEGSAs other investors have actively pursued legal and other efforts in Guatemala to remedy CNEEs actions which have been resolved against EEGSA. Through Dec. 31, 2009, these efforts had not resolved the dispute and TGH has until 2011 to initiate a claim under the DR CAFTA . Iberdrola is in international arbitration under the bilateral trade treaty in place between the Republic of Guatemala and the Kingdom of Spain. In 2009, TECO Guatemalas net income was $38.6 million, compared to $36.9 million in 2008. TECO Guatemalas full year 2009 non GAAP results, which exclude the $8.7 million gain on the sale of Navega were $29.9 million, compared to 2008 non GAAP results of $46.5 million, which exclude $9.6 million of taxes related to the December cash repatriation. Results in 2009 reflect lower results at the San Jos&eacute; Power Station due to unplanned outages for much of the first half of the year and lower capacity payments under the power sales contract as a result of lower availability due to the unplanned outages, partially offset by a $1.7 million net insurance recovery related to the unplanned outages. Results also reflect the reduction in the VAD tariff at EEGSA which reduced 2009 earnings at TECO Guatemala by approximately $5.0 million. The effect of the VAD more than offset the benefit of 28,000 additional customers, or 2.9% customer growth, higher energy sales, and cost control measures at EEGSA. The earnings from the DECA II unregulated EEGSA affiliated companies, which provide, among other things, electricity transmission services, wholesale power sales to unregulated electric customers and engineering services, decreased due to the loss of the earnings from the telecommunications service provider, Navega, which was sold in the first quarter of 2009. The 2009 results for EEGSA and affiliated companies also include a $2.5 million benefit related to an adjustment to previously estimated year end equity balances, compared to a similar $3.1 million benefit in 2008. In 2008, TECO Guatemalas net income was $36.9 million, compared to $44.7 million in 2007. In December 2008, TECO Guatemala repatriated $71.7 million of cash and investments to TECO Energy, resulting in additional taxes of $9.6 million. TECO Guatemalas full year 2008 non GAAP results, which exclude $9.6 million of taxes related to the December 2008 repatriation of cash, were $46.5 million. The San Jos&eacute; Power Station realized increased revenues in 2008 from significantly higher prices for spot energy sales. Revenues from contract energy sales increased due to a scheduled price escalation. Higher operating expenses and lower interest income on lower cash balances were essentially offset by lower interest on project debt. EEGSA had 3.9% customer growth in 2008, increasing its customer base by 37,000 to over 877,000 at year end. The reduction in the VAD tariff at EEGSA starting in August 2008 reduced 2008 earnings at TECO Guatemala approximately $5.0 million. The 2008 results for EEGSA and affiliated companies also included a $3.1 million benefit related to an adjustment to previously estimated 2007 income and year end equity balances, compared to a similar $1.9 million benefit in 2007. TECO Guatemala Outlook In 2010, we expect improved operating and financial performance at the San Jos&eacute; Power Station following the extended unplanned outages in 2009, and higher contract capacity payments, which are expected to increase as the 12 month rolling average capacity factor improves. EEGSA, the Guatemalan distribution utility, continues to experience customer and energy sales growth, but the issue with the VAD remains unresolved. There have been hearings in the Guatemalan courts, and Iberdrola, EEGSAs largest investor, is in an international arbitration process under the bilateral trade agreement between Spain and Guatemala. In 2001, EEGSA and Alborada (a subsidiary of TECO Guatemala) entered into an agreement (the Option) to extend the term of the Alborada power sales contract, which is scheduled to expire in September 2010, for five years at the end of the contract period. At the time of the execution of the Option (2001), the Guatemalan regulators expressly approved the pass through to the tariff of all costs associated with the extended term of the contract; however, even though Alborada is in compliance with all of the terms of the Option, the current Guatemalan regulator has objected to the extension citing modifications to regulations passed in 2007. Alborada is currently in negotiations with the Guatemalan government to extend this contract term as originally intended. If the term of the contract is not extended in accordance with the Option, the net income from Alborada would be reduced or eliminated and an impairment charge could be taken. PARENT/OTHER In 2009, Parent/other cost was $54.0 million, compared to a cost of $55.2 million in 2008. Non GAAP Parent/other cost was $48.6 million in 2009, compared to $45.8 million in 2008. Results in 2009 reflect a $2.6 million unfavorable valuation adjustment to foreign tax credits, a $1.5 million gain on the sale of a lease, the final asset held in a leveraged lease portfolio, and a $2.6 million benefit from a sale of property by TECO Properties. Results in 2009 also reflect negative tax return adjustments that normally occur, compared to 2008 when the tax return adjustments were favorable. Non GAAP Parent/other cost in 2009 excluded $1.6 million of restructuring costs and a $3.8 million charge associated with the sale of student loan securities held at TECO Energy parent (see the 2009 and 2008 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results tables). Parent/other cost was $55.2 million in 2008, compared to net income of $52.5 million in 2007. In 2008 the non GAAP cost was $45.8 million, compared to the non GAAP cost of $60.4 million in 2007. Non GAAP costs in 2008 exclude $12.0 million of non cash income taxes on the December 2008 repatriation of cash and investments from TECO Guatemala and a $2.6 million net benefit from adjustments to income taxes and previously estimated costs related to the sale of TECO Transport. Non GAAP costs in 2007 exclude the $149.4 million net gain on the sale of TECO Transport, $16.3 million of charges related to the sale of TECO 49 Table of Contents Transport, and the $20.2 million charge related to the debt extinguishment/exchanges completed in December (see the 2008 and 2007 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results tables). In 2008, interest expense at TECO Energy Parent and TECO Finance, combined, declined $18.5 million reflecting debt retirement actions. TECO TRANSPORT We completed the sale of TECO Transport to an investment group for gross proceeds of $405 million in December 2007. The sale resulted in a net book gain of $149.4 million, before $16.3 million of transaction related costs recorded at TECO Energy parent. Proceeds from the sale of TECO Transport were used to pay down parent level debt on an accelerated basis. Because of the Assets Held for Sale classification of TECO Transport, the recording of depreciation was discontinued as of Apr. 1, 2007. Net income through Dec. 3, 2007 was $34.0 million and Non GAAP results were $24.3 million in 2007, including the $9.7 million of depreciation expense that was not recorded in GAAP net income (see the 2007 Reconciliation of GAAP net income from continuing operations to non GAAP results tables). OTHER ITEMS IMPACTING NET INCOME Other income (expense) In 2009, Other income (expense) of $79.3 million reflected $68.5 million, which included the $18.3 million pretax gain on the sale of Navega, from the Guatemalan operations, which are accounted for as equity investments, and a net $3.3 million charge related to the sale of various investments. In 2008, Other income (expense) of $100.7 million reflected $72.5 million of pretax income from the Guatemalan operations, which are accounted for as equity investments; $7.2 million of pretax interest income on invested cash balances; and $6.7 million of pretax income from the sale of right of way easements and a contract settlement related to future coal sales at TECO Coal. In 2007, Other income (expense) of $152.1 million reflected $84.5 million of mark to market gains on the oil price hedges on synthetic fuel production at TECO Coal; $68.6 million of pretax income from the Guatemalan operations, which are accounted for as equity investments; $19.4 million of pretax interest income on invested cash balances; and a $32.9 million pretax charge related to the debt extinguishment/exchange . AFUDC equity at Tampa Electric, which is included in Other income (expense), was $9.3 million, $6.3 million and $4.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. AFUDC is expected to decrease in 2010 due to the completion of the installation of combustion turbines to meet peak load capacity needs, the rail unloading facilities at Tampa Electrics Big Bend Power Station and for the third NOx control also at Big Bend Power Station (see the Environmental Compliance and Liquidity, Capital Resources sections). Interest Expense In 2009, total interest expense was $227.0 million compared to $228.9 million in 2008 and $257.8 million in 2007. In 2009, interest expense was reduced by lower interest rates on floating rate debt and higher AFUDC debt at Tampa Electric, which is a credit to interest expense. In 2008, interest expense was reduced by the December 2007 retirement of $297 million of TECO Energy debt and the full year benefit of other debt retirement in 2007, including the repayment of $300 million of 6.125% notes in May 2007 and the repayment of $111 million of 5% Dock and Wharf bonds in September 2007. Interest expense also reflects Tampa Electric Companys issuance of $100 million of 6.10% notes in July 2009 (see the Financing Activity section). Interest expense is expected to be higher in 2010 due to higher borrowing levels at Tampa Electric Company, less AFUDC debt capitalized to construction, and the refinancing of $100 million of low interest rate, floating rate debt maturing in 2010 (see the Liquidity, Capital Resources section). Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased in 2009 primarily due to higher operating income, partially offset by lower foreign tax credit valuation allowances, lower taxes on cash repatriated from Guatemala, and increased depletion and AFUDC equity. The provision for income taxes decreased in 2008 due to lower operating income, the termination of the synthetic fuel operations tax credit program and its related investor income, and the gain recognized on the sale of TECO Transport in 2007. Income tax expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before taxes was 31.6% in 2009, 36.8% in 2008, and 34.9% in 2007. For 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 35%. The cash payments for income taxes, as required by the federal Alternative Minimum Tax rules (AMT), state income taxes and payments (refunds) related to prior years audits totaled $4.1 million, $6.0 million and ($10.5) million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2007 refund was a result of a 2003 and 2004 foreign tax credit carryback claim. In recent years, due to the generation of deferred income tax assets related to the net operating loss (NOL) carryforward from disposition of the generating assets formerly held by TWG Merchant, our unregulated power generation subsidiary which is no longer in that business, cash tax payments for income taxes were limited to approximately 10% of the AMT rate. We expect future 50 Table of Contents cash tax payments to be limited to a similar level reduced by AMT foreign tax credits and various state taxes. We currently expect to utilize these NOLs through 2013, at which time we expect to start using more than $190 million of AMT carry forward to limit future cash tax payments for federal income taxes to the level of AMT. We currently project cash tax payments of approximately $0.5 million in 2010, and less than $3 million in 2011 and 2012. We expect 2013 cash payments to increase to $25 million as a result of having fully utilized the remainder of the NOL. The tax credit for the production of synthetic fuel expired at the end of 2007. The credit was determined annually and was $0.4103 per million Btu for 2007 after phase out ($1.2509 per million Btu with no phase out). The income tax effect of gains and losses from discontinued operations is shown as a component of results from discontinued operations. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In 2007, net income from discontinued operations reflected a $14.3 million tax benefit recorded in discontinued operations in the second quarter as a result of reaching a favorable conclusion with taxing authorities related to the 2005 disposition of the Union and Gila River merchant power plants. TECO Transport was not classified as a discontinued operation due to the ongoing contractual relationship with Tampa Electric for solid fuel waterborne transportation services. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The table below sets forth the Dec. 31, 2009 consolidated liquidity and cash balances, the cash balances at the operating companies and TECO Energy parent, and amounts available under the TECO Energy/Finance and Tampa Electric Company credit facilities. Balances as of Dec. 31, 2009 (millions) Consolidated Tampa ElectricCompany UnregulatedCompanies Parent Credit facilities $ 675.0 $ 475.0 $ $ 200.0 Drawn amounts/LCs 62.6 55.7 6.9 Available credit facilities 612.4 419.3 193.1 Cash and short term investments 46.8 5.5 19.4 21.9 Total liquidity $ 659.2 $ 424.8 $ 19.4 $ 215.0 Consolidated other cash and short term investments included $19.4 million of cash at the unregulated operating companies for normal operations. In addition to consolidated cash, as of Dec. 31, 2009 unconsolidated affiliates owned by TECO Guatemala, CGESJ (San Jos&eacute;) and TCAE (Alborada), had unrestricted cash balances of $24.1 million, which are not included in the table above. In 2009, we met our cash flow needs primarily from a mix of internal sources supplemented with net borrowings of $57.1 million, of which $102.0 million represented notes issued by Tampa Electric Company (see the Financing Activity section). Cash from operations was $724.7 million. Other sources of cash included $31.6 million of proceeds from the sale of businesses, primarily the sale of our ownership interest in the Guatemalan telecommunications provider, Navega, $5.1 million from the sale of common stock, primarily through dividend reinvestment, and $16.1 million from the sale of student loan securities and other investments. We paid dividends of $170.8 million in 2009, and capital expenditures were $639.8 million. In 2008, we met our cash needs primarily from a mix of internal sources and cash on hand at the beginning of the year, including cash held offshore which was repatriated in December 2008. We supplemented this with net borrowings of $102 million, of which $68 million represented borrowings under bank credit facilities. Cash from operations was $388 million in 2008. Other sources of cash included net proceeds of $79 million in January associated with the settlement of 2007 oil price hedges related to TECO Coals synthetic fuel program, and $22 million in common stock proceeds. We paid dividends in 2008 of $169 million, and our capital expenditures for the year were $590 million. In 2007, cash from operations was $554 million. Other sources of cash in 2007 included $405 million from the sale of TECO Transport. We used cash to retire $357 million of TECO Energy parent debt at maturity, $111 million of TECO Energy parent guaranteed TECO Transport Dock and Wharf bonds at maturity, and $297 million of TECO Energy parent debt prior to maturity, and the regulated companies reduced short term borrowings $23 million and repaid $150 million of long term debt at maturity. Cash from Operations In 2009, consolidated cash flow from operations was $724.7 million, which was positively impacted by $136.6 million associated with net recoveries of deferred costs, primarily fuel and purchased power, under FPSC approved recovery clauses. Cash from operations reflects a $6.7 million contribution to the pension plan in 2009. 51 Table of Contents We expect cash from operations in 2010 to be below the 2009 level. Although we expect higher net income in 2010, we expect the net recoveries under various regulatory clauses to reduce cash from operations. In November 2009, the FPSC approved recovery clause rates that provide for refunds to customers of estimated 2009 net over recoveries of fuel and purchased power over the 12 months beginning Jan. 1, 2010 (see the Regulation section). Cash from Investing Activities Our investing activities in 2009 resulted in a net use of cash of $582.3 million, including capital expenditures totaling $639.8 million. We received $29.0 million in 2009 representing the proceeds from our ownership interest in the Guatemalan telecommunications provider, Navega. Investing activity in 2009 also included 16.1 million received primarily from the sale of student loan securities and other investments. We expect capital spending for the next several years to be lower, primarily at Tampa Electric due to the 2009 completion of spending on combustion turbines to meet peak load needs and rail unloading facilities for the delivery of coal, and the completion of the fourth and final NOx control project in 2010. Spending to support customer growth at Tampa Electric and PGS is expected to be lower for several years due to the weak Florida economy and housing market. The economic recession and reduction in energy demand statewide has allowed the deferral of certain Central Florida transmission system upgrades (see the Tampa Electric and Capital Expenditures sections). Cash from Financing Activities Our financing activities in 2009 resulted in net use of cash of $108.6 million. Major items included $102.0 million of proceeds from Tampa Electric Companys issuance of notes due in 2018, and the repayment of $38.0 million of short term debt. We paid $170.8 million in common stock dividends, and we received $5.1 million from the sale of common stock from our dividend reinvestment program and exercises of stock options. In 2010, Tampa Electric Company expects to utilize internally generated funds, equity contributions from TECO Energy, and short term borrowings under its credit facilities to support its capital spending program and for normal working capital fluctuations. We have $100 million of floating rate notes maturing in 2010. See the Cash and Liquidity Outlook section below for a discussion of financing expectations in 2010 and beyond. Cash and Liquidity Outlook In general, we target to maintain consolidated liquidity (unrestricted cash on hand plus undrawn credit facilities) of at least $500 million. At Dec. 31, 2009 our consolidated liquidity was $659.2 million, consisting of $424.8 million at Tampa Electric Company, $215.0 million at TECO Energy parent and $19.4 million at the other consolidated operating companies. In addition, there was $24.1 million of unrestricted cash at the unconsolidated TECO Guatemala operating companies. We expect our sources of cash in 2010 to include cash from operations at levels below 2009, due in large part to lower net recoveries under various regulatory clauses in 2010 as described above, partially offset by expected higher net income from the operating companies. We plan to use cash generated in 2010 to fund capital spending estimated at $445 million, and for dividends to shareholders. Because of the current favorable interest rate environment, we intend to refinance our $100 million of notes maturing in 2010. Tampa Electric Company expects to utilize cash from operations and equity contributions from us to support its capital spending program, supplemented with minimal incremental utilization of its credit facilities. Our credit facilities contain certain financial covenants (see Covenants in Financing Agreements section). Although we expect the normal utilization of our credit facilities to be low, we estimate that we could fully utilize the total available capacity under our facilities in 2010 and remain within the covenant restrictions. Beyond 2010, our long term debt maturities for TECO Energy parent and TECO Finance total $364 million in 2011, $336 million in 2012, $200 million in 2015 and $300 million in 2017. Although we plan to retire a portion of these maturities with cash generated internally, because market conditions are currently favorable, on Feb. 22, 2010, we commenced a tender offer to ultimately refinance up to $300 million of the notes with new notes having longer maturities. Tampa Electric Company has two series of notes totaling $650 million maturing in 2012 and will need to issue replacement debt to fund those maturities. The existing bank credit facilities for both Tampa Electric Company and TECO Energy/TECO Finance expire in 2012. Our expected cash flow could be affected by variables discussed in the individual operating company sections, such as customer growth and usage changes at our regulated businesses, and coal margins. In addition, actual fuel and other regulatory clause net recoveries will typically vary from those forecasted; however, the differences are generally recovered within the next calendar year. It is possible, however, that unforeseen cash requirements and or shortfalls, or higher capital spending requirements could cause us to fall short of our liquidity target (see the Risk Factors section). 52 Table of Contents The capital expenditures expected at Tampa Electric Company over the next several years will require additional equity contributions from TECO Energy in order to support the capital structure and financial integrity of the utilities. Tampa Electric Company expects to fund its capital needs with a combination of internally generated cash, and equity contributions from us. The 2007 sale of TECO Transport allowed us to use proceeds for the early implementation of parent debt retirement plans and positioned us to redeploy part of the cash planned for parent debt retirement in future years to Tampa Electric Company in the form of significant parent equity contributions in 2008. In addition, through 2012, we expect to realize significant cash benefits from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2004 and 2005 upon the disposition of merchant power assets to reduce federal and certain state income taxes and expect that our cash payment of income taxes in those years will be less than $3 million. As a result of our significant debt retirements in 2007 and reduced business risk, we have improved our debt credit ratings and ratings outlooks (see Credit Ratings section). It is our intention to continue to improve our financial profile, with a goal of achieving additional ratings improvements. In the unlikely event Tampa Electric Companys ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, counterparties to our derivative instruments could request immediate payment or full collateralization of net liability positions. If the credit risk related contingent features underlying these derivative instruments were triggered as of Dec. 31, 2009, we could have been required to post additional collateral or settle existing positions with counterparties totaling $37 million, including Tampa Electric Company positions of $36 million. In addition, credit provisions in long term gas transportation agreements of Tampa Electric and PGS would give the transportation providers the right to demand collateral which we estimate to be approximately $52 million. None of our credit facilities or financing agreements has ratings downgrade covenants, which would require immediate repayment or collateralization; however in the event of a downgrade our interest expense could be higher. Credit Facilities At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, the following credit facilities and related borrowings existed: Dec. 31, 2009 Dec. 31, 2008 (millions) CreditFacilities BorrowingsOutstanding (1) Letters ofCreditOutstanding CreditFacilities BorrowingsOutstanding (1) Letters ofCreditOutstanding Tampa Electric 5 year facility $ 325.0 $ 55.0 $ 0.7 $ 325.0 $ $ 1.4 1 year accountsreceivable facility 150.0 150.0 29.0 TECO Finance 5 year facility 200.0 6.9 200.0 64.0 7.1 Total $ 675.0 $ 55.0 $ 7.6 $ 675.0 $ 93.0 $ 8.5 (1) Borrowings outstanding are reported as notes payable. Credit facilities, including the one year accounts receivable facility which was renewed in February 2010, require commitment fees ranging from 7.0 to 60.0 basis points. The weighted average interest rates on outstanding notes payable under the credit facilities at Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008 were 0.66% and 2.65%, respectively. At Dec. 31, 2009, TECO Finance had a $200 million bank credit facility in place guaranteed by TECO Energy with a maturity date in May 2012. Tampa Electric Company had a bank credit facility totaling $325 million, also maturing in May 2012. In addition, Tampa Electric Company had a $150 million accounts receivable securitized borrowing facility with a maturity date in March 2010. The TECO Finance and Tampa Electric Company bank credit facilities include sub limits for letters of credit of $200 million and $50 million, respectively. At Dec. 31, 2009, the TECO Finance credit facility was undrawn and $6.9 million of letters of credit were outstanding. At Dec. 31, 2009, $55.0 million was drawn on the Tampa Electric Company credit facilities and $0.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding. These credit facilities have financial covenants as identified in Covenants in Financing Agreements section. At current ratings, TECO Finances and Tampa Electric Companys bank credit facilities require commitment fees of 12.5 basis points and 7.0 basis points, respectively, and drawn amounts are charged interest at LIBOR plus 55.0 60.0 basis points and 35.0 40.0 basis points, respectively. At Dec. 31, 2009, the LIBOR interest rate was 0.23%. Tampa Electric Company and TEC Receivables Corp. (TRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tampa Electric Company, have a $150 million accounts receivable collateralized borrowing facility. Under this facility, Tampa Electric Company sells and or contributes to TRC all of its receivables for the sale of electricity or gas to its customers and related rights. The receivables are sold by Tampa Electric Company to TRC at a discount, which was initially 2%. The discount is subject to adjustment for future sales to reflect changes in prevailing interest rates and collection experience. TRC is consolidated in the financial statements of Tampa Electric Company and TECO Energy. Under a Loan and Servicing Agreement, TRC may borrow up to $150 million to fund its acquisition of the receivables under the facility, and TRC secures such borrowings with a pledge of all of its assets, including the receivables. Tampa Electric Company acts as the servicer to service the collection of the receivables. TRC pays program and liquidity fees based on Tampa Electric 53 Table of Contents Companys credit ratings, which total 100 basis points under its renewed facility. Interest rates on the borrowings are based on prevailing asset backed commercial paper rates, unless such rates are not available from conduit lenders, or under certain circumstances upon a change of accounting rules applicable to the lenders, in which case the rates will be at an interest rate equal to, at Tampa Electric Companys option, either Citibanks prime rate (or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, if higher) or a rate based on the London interbank deposit rate (if available) plus a margin. The facility includes the following financial covenants: (1) at each quarter end, Tampa Electric Companys debt to capital ratio, as defined in the agreement, must not exceed 65%; and (2) certain dilution and delinquency ratios with respect to the receivables (see the Covenants in Financing Agreements section). Tampa Electric Company renewed this facility Feb. 19, 2010 with a Feb. 18, 2011 maturity date. Covenants in Financing Agreements In order to utilize their respective bank credit facilities, TECO Energy/Finance and Tampa Electric Company must meet certain financial tests as defined in the applicable agreements (see the Credit Facilities section). In addition, TECO Energy, TECO Finance, Tampa Electric Company, and other operating companies have certain restrictive covenants in specific agreements and debt instruments. At Dec. 31, 2009, TECO Energy, TECO Finance, Tampa Electric Company, and the other operating companies were in compliance with all required financial covenants. The table that follows lists the significant financial covenants and the performance relative to them at Dec. 31, 2009. Reference is made to the specific agreements and instruments for more details. TECO Energy Significant Financial Covenants (millions, unless otherwise indicated) Instrument Financial Covenant (1) Requirement/Restriction Calculation at Dec. 31, 2009 Tampa Electric Company PGS senior notes EBIT/interest (2) Minimum of 2.0 times 3.2 times Restricted payments Shareholder equity at least $500 $2,104 Funded debt/capital Cannot exceed 65% 49.8% Sale of assets Less than 20% of total assets 0% Credit facility (3) Debt/capital Cannot exceed 65% 49.4% Accounts receivable credit facility (3) Debt/capital Cannot exceed 65% 49.4% 6.25% senior notes Debt/capital Cannot exceed 60% 49.4% Limit on liens (4) Cannot exceed $700 $0 liens outstanding Insurance agreement relating to certain pollution bonds Limit on liens (4) Cannot exceed $429 (7.5% of net assets) $0 liens outstanding TECO Energy/TECO Finance Credit facility EBITDA/interest (2) Minimum of 2.6 times 3.9 times TECO Energy floating rate and 6.75% notes and TECO Finance 6.75% notes Restrictions on secured debt (6) (5) (5) TECO Diversified Coal supply agreement guarantee Dividend restriction Net worth not less than $298 (40% of tangible net assets) $555 (1) As defined in each applicable instrument.

However, in each circumstance, the term is subject to the definition prescribed under the relevant agreements. (3) See description of the Tampa Electric Company accounts receivable credit facilities (see Note 6 and Note 26 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). (4) If the limitation on liens is exceeded the company is required to provide ratable security to the holders of these notes. (5) The indentures for these notes contain restrictions which limit secured debt of TECO Energy if secured by Principal Property or Capital Stock or indebtedness of directly held subsidiaries (with exceptions as defined in the indentures) without equally and ratably securing these notes. (6) These limitations would not include first mortgage bonds of Tampa Electric if any were outstanding. Credit Ratings of Senior Unsecured Debt at Dec. 31, 2009 Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Tampa Electric Company BBB Baa1 BBB+ TECO Energy/TECO Finance BBB Baa3 BBB On May 6, 2009, Standard & Poors Rating Services changed its corporate credit rating on TECO Energy, TECO Finance and Tampa Electric Company to BBB from BBB and changed its outlook to stable from positive. This upgrade resulted in credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of TECO Energy and TECO Finance of BBB . This upgrade returned TECO Energys senior unsecured credit rating to investment grade at these three credit rating agencies. As a result many, but not all, of the restrictive covenants in various financing arrangements are no longer applicable. 54 Table of Contents On May 15, 2009 Moodys Investors Service upgraded Tampa Electric Companys senior unsecured debt to Baa1 from Baa2 and changed its outlook to stable from positive. At the same time Moodys affirmed the ratings for TECO Energy and TECO Finance with stable outlooks at both. On Jun. 1, 2009, Fitch Ratings affirmed the outstanding ratings of TECO Energy, TECO Finance and Tampa Electric Company, and the outlook remained stable. All three rating agencies cited the March and May decisions by the FPSC in the base rate proceedings for Tampa Electric and PGS, respectively, as being supportive of credit quality. Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch describe credit ratings in the BBB or Baa category as representing adequate capacity for payment of financial obligations. The lowest investment grade credit ratings for Standard & Poors is BBB , for Moodys is Baa3 and for Fitch is BBB ; thus all three credit rating agencies assign TECO Energy, TECO Finance and Tampa Electric Companys senior unsecured debt investment grade ratings. A credit rating agency rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Any future downgrades in credit ratings may affect our ability to borrow and may increase financing costs, which may decrease earnings (see the Risk Factors section). Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table lists the obligations of TECO Energy and its subsidiaries for cash payments to repay debt, lease payments and unconditional commitments related to capital expenditures. This table does not include contingent obligations, which are discussed in a subsequent table. Contractual Cash Obligations at Dec. 31, 2009 Payments Due by Period (millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Long term debt (1) Recourse $ 3,302.1 $ 106.5 $ 366.9 $ 989.8 $ 144.0 $ 1,694.9 Non recourse (2) 7.6 1.4 1.5 1.5 3.2 Operating leases/rentals (3) 50.8 10.3 8.0 4.7 4.9 22.9 Net purchase obligations/commitments (4) 314.1 156.3 41.8 39.1 76.7 0.2 Interest payment obligations (5) 1,782.0 209.9 193.8 160.0 221.9 996.4 Pension plans (6) 251.6 41.5 89.6 46.3 74.2 Total contractual obligations $ 5,708.2 $ 525.9 $ 701.6 $ 1,241.4 $ 524.9 $ 2,714.4 (1) Includes debt at TECO Energy, TECO Finance, Tampa Electric, PGS and the other operating companies (see Note 7 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements for a list of long term debt and the respective due dates). Does not include debt at the deconsolidated Guatemalan affiliates. (2) Reflects an intercompany loan at TECO Guatemala between its consolidated Cayman Island entity and an unconsolidated Guatemalan affiliate. (3) The table above excludes payment obligations under contractual agreements of Tampa Electric and PGS for fuel, fuel transportation and power purchases, which are recovered under regulatory clauses approved by the FPSC annually (see the Regulation section). One of these agreements, in accordance with accounting standards for arrangements that contain a lease has been determined to contain a lease (see Note 12 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). (4) Reflects those contractual obligations and commitments considered material to the respective operating companies, individually. At the end of 2009, these commitments include Tampa Electrics outstanding commitments for materials and installation related to the NOx control equipment or other major projects, long term capitalized maintenance agreements for its combustion turbines, and commitments related to the SeaCoast pipeline and associated lateral. (5) Includes variable rate notes at interest rates as of Dec. 31, 2009. (6) The total includes the estimated minimum required contributions to the qualified pension plan as of the measurement date and incremental amounts estimated to achieve certain funding levels. Future contributions are included but they are subject to annual valuation reviews, which may vary significantly due to changes in interest rates, discount rate assumptions, plan asset performance, which is affected by stock market performance and other factors (see Liquidity, Capital Resources section and Note 5 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). 55 Table of Contents Summary of Contingent Obligations The following table summarizes the letters of credit and guarantees outstanding that are not included in the Summary of Contractual Obligations table above and not otherwise included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts represent guarantees by TECO Energy on behalf of consolidated subsidiaries. TECO Energy has no guarantees outstanding on behalf of unconsolidated or unrelated parties.

(2) Represents the capital expenditures of TECO Coal, Seacoast LLC and the consolidated operations of TECO Guatemala. TECO Energys 2009 capital expenditures of $639.8 million included $533 million at Tampa Electric, including $13.8 million of AFUDC debt and equity and $13 million of amounts paid in 2009 but incurred in a prior period. Capital expenditures at PGS were $51 million in 2009. Tampa Electrics capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily for equipment and facilities to meet limited customer growth, generating equipment maintenance, capital expenditures required for construction of additional generating capacity in the form of five peaking units, a rail coal unloading facility, environmental compliance, and NOx control projects (see the Environmental Compliance section). Capital expenditures for PGS were approximately $33 million for system expansion and approximately $18 million for maintenance of the existing system. TECO Coals capital expenditures included $24 million primarily for normal mining equipment replacement, and $23 million for new mine development. TECO Energy estimates capital spending for ongoing operations to be $450 million for 2010 and approximately $1.6 billion during the 2011 2014 period. For 2010, Tampa Electric expects to spend $305 million. For the transmission and distribution systems Tampa Electric expects to spend $130 million in 2010, including approximately $88 million for normal transmission and distribution system expansion and reliability, $22 million for transmission and distribution system storm hardening, and $20 million for expansion and improvements to Tampa Electrics high voltage transmission system. Capital expenditures for the existing generating facilities of $125 million include approximately $30 million for repair and refurbishments of combustion turbines under long term agreements 56 Table of Contents with equipment manufacturers; approximately $35 million in major improvements to the coal fired Big Bend Unit 1 to take advantage of the extended outage to install NOx control equipment, $10 million for a reclaimed water pipeline to eliminate ground water usage at the Polk Power Station, and $50 million for other improvements and refurbishments to generating units. In addition, Tampa Electric expects to spend the final $15 million for the addition of SCR equipment at the Big Bend Power Station for NOx control, and $10 million for other environmental compliance programs in 2010. The Environmental Consent Decree compliance expenditures are eligible for recovery of depreciation and a return on investment through the ECRC (see the Environmental Compliance section). In the 2011 2014 period, Tampa Electric expects to spend $45 million for the completion of the reclaimed water pipeline project at the Polk Power Station. Capital spending for environmental compliance is expected to average almost $20 million annually in the same period. In addition to the above amounts, Tampa Electric expects to spend approximately $285 million annually to support normal system growth and reliability in the 2011 2014 period. This level of ongoing capital expenditures reflects the costs for materials and contractors, long term regulatory requirements for storm hardening, and an active program of transmission and distribution system upgrades which will occur over the forecast period. These programs and requirements include: approximately $35 million annually for repair and refurbishments of combustion turbines under long term agreements with equipment manufacturers; average annual expenditures of more than $90 million to support generating unit availability and reliability; average annual expenditures of $25 million for general infrastructure to support customers; average annual expenditures of more than $20 million for transmission and distribution system storm hardening; approximately $25 million annually for transmission system reliability and capacity improvements; and an average of about $90 million annually for distribution system reliability and to meet the expected resumption of modest customer growth after 2010. Capital expenditures for PGS are expected to be about $50 million in 2010 and $200 million during the 2011 2014 period. Included in these amounts is an average of approximately $25 million annually for projects associated with customer growth and system expansion. The remainder represents capital expenditures for ongoing renewal, replacement and system safety. The unregulated companies expect to invest $95 million in 2010 and $190 million during the 2011 2014 period. Included in these amounts are expenditures for coal mine development to maintain production, compliance with new safety requirements under the MINER Act, and for normal coal mining equipment renewal and replacement at TECO Coal. Included in the 2010 forecast are $45 million of capital expenditures associated with the construction of the Seacoast LLC natural gas pipeline in northeast Florida, which is expected to be completed in late 2010. Tampa Electric Generating Capacity Additions In 2009, Tampa Electric completed the construction of five peaking capacity combustion turbines at the Bayside and Big Bend power stations, with a total project cost of approximately $195 million, excluding AFUDC. These units were used to meet the summer peak demand requirements in 2009 and the new winter peak experienced in January 2010. One combustion turbine at each of the facilities is configured to meet the NERC black start requirements for system reliability. Due to the dramatic slowdown in the Florida and national economies and the Florida housing market, Tampa Electric has deferred new baseload capacity until beyond the current forecast period. Tampa Electric may require peaking capacity in the 2013 period, after the expiration of the purchased power agreement with the Hardee Power Station in Central Florida. If demand growth resumes and additional generating capacity is required, Tampa Electric may construct this additional peaking capacity or seek to purchase power rather than build based on the economics (see the Tampa Electric and Regulation sections). If Tampa Electric builds this capacity, capital expenditures would start in 2012. Pending action by the U.S. Congress or the Florida Legislature on a national or Florida renewable portfolio standard (RPS), the need for additional capital spending for renewable generating resources to meet the requirements of a RPS is likely but not yet defined (see the Environmental Compliance section). Depending on the final federal or state rules, which may be enacted in 2010, Tampa Electric may need to invest capital to develop additional sources of renewable power generation. The forecast capital expenditures shown above are based on our current estimates and assumptions for normal maintenance capital at the operating companies; capital expenditures to support normal system reliability and growth at Tampa Electric and PGS; the programs for transmission and distribution system storm hardening and transmission system reliability requirements; and incremental investments above normal maintenance capital to expand the PGS system, the Seacoast LLC pipeline construction, and production capacity at TECO Coal. Actual capital expenditures could vary materially from these estimates due to changes in costs for materials or labor or changes in plans (see the Risk Factors section). Financing Activity Our year end 2009 consolidated capital structure was 62% senior debt and 38% common equity. The debt to total capital ratio has improved significantly over the past three years, primarily due to the repayment of $765 million of parent and parent guaranteed debt in 2007, as well as the increase in retained earnings due to the gain on the sale of TECO Transport in 2007. At Dec. 31, 2009, Tampa Electric Companys year end capital structure was 49% debt and 51% common equity. 57 Table of Contents In 2009, we issued no new long term debt at the TECO Energy parent level or at TECO Finance. We raised $5.1 million of equity primarily through our dividend reinvestment plan. In July 2009, Tampa Electric Company completed an offering of $100 million aggregate principal amount of 6.10% Notes due May 15, 2018. These notes were sold at 102.988% of par. The offering resulted in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses) of approximately $102.0 million. Net proceeds were used to repay short term debt and for general corporate purposes. In May 2008, Tampa Electric Company issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.10% Notes due May 15, 2018. The notes were sold at par. The offering resulted in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses) of approximately $148.7 million. Net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In connection with this debt offering, Tampa Electric Company settled interest rate swaps entered into in 2007 for $11.8 million. These amounts will be reclassified to interest expense over the 10 year term of the related debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6.89%. In March 2008, in response to the turmoil in the auction rate securities market, the Hillsborough County Industrial Development Authority (HCIDA) remarketed $86.0 million Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (Tampa Electric Company Project), Series 2006, in a fixed rate mode. The bonds, which previously had been in auction rate mode, bear interest at 5.00% per annum and are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on Mar. 15, 2012 from the proceeds of a remarketing of the bonds. Tampa Electric Company is responsible for payment of the interest and principal associated with the bonds. Regularly scheduled principal and interest, when due, are insured by Ambac Assurance. Also in March 2008, Tampa Electric Company purchased in lieu of redemption $75.0 million Polk County Industrial Development Authority (PCIDA) Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Refunding Bonds (Tampa Electric Company Project), Series 2007 and $125.8 million HCIDA Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (Tampa Electric Company Project), Series 2007A, B and C (collectively, the 2007 Bonds). Also on that date, the Insurance Agreement with Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), pursuant to which FGIC issued a financial guaranty insurance policy for the 2007 HCIDA Bonds, was terminated. Tampa Electric Company also entered into a corresponding First Supplemental Loan and Trust Agreement regarding the removal of the bond insurance on the 2007 HCIDA Bonds. After these changes to the 2007 HCIDA Bonds, Tampa Electric Company remarketed the $54.2 million 2007 Series A and the $51.6 million 2007 Series B Bonds in long term interest rate modes. The $54.2 million 2007 Series A bonds, which previously had been in auction rate mode, bear interest at 5.65% per annum until maturity on Mar. 15, 2018. The $51.6 million 2007 Series B bonds, which previously had been in auction rate mode, bear interest at 5.15% per annum and will be subject to mandatory tender on Sep. 1, 2013 from the proceeds of a remarketing of the bonds. Tampa Electric Company is responsible for payment of the interest and principal associated with the 2007 Bonds. As a result of these transactions, $95.0 million of the bonds purchased in lieu of redemption were held by the trustee at the direction of Tampa Electric Company as of Dec. 31, 2009 (the Held Bonds) to provide an opportunity to evaluate refinancing alternatives. The Held Bonds effectively offset the outstanding debt balances and are presented net on the balance sheet. Off Balance Sheet Debt at Dec. 31, 2009 Unconsolidated affiliates had project debt balances as follows at Dec. 31, 2009. The San Jos&eacute; Power Station financing is a non recourse project loan, and the debt associated with DECA II is general corporate debt at DECA II; all of this debt is held at the project entity level. Although we are not directly obligated on the debt, our equity interest in those unconsolidated affiliates and its commitments with respect to those projects are at risk if interest and principal payments on these loans are not made timely. Our equity investment in TECO Guatemala was $361.1 million at Dec. 31, 2009. (millions) Long term Debt Ownership Interest TECO Guatemala San Jos&eacute; Power Station $ 54.4 100 % DECA II $ 174.3 30 % The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments in partnership and corporate entities in which we, our subsidiary companies, do not have either a majority ownership or exercise control. We deconsolidated the project entities for the San Jos&eacute; and Alborada power stations in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of implementing the accounting guidance for variable interest entities. The San Jos&eacute; Power Station is partially financed with non recourse debt, which following the deconsolidation was considered to be off balance sheet financing. As a result of new accounting standards regarding variable interest entities, effective Jan. 1, 2010 we are re consolidating the San Jos&eacute; and Alborada project entities, including the $54.4 million of debt shown in the table above (see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section). 58 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingencies. The policies and estimates identified below are, in the view of management, the more significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. See Note 1 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our significant accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Deferred Income Taxes We use the liability method in the measurement of deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, we estimate our current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation for financial statement and tax purposes. These differences are reported as deferred taxes measured at current rates in the consolidated financial statements. Management reviews all reasonably available current and historical information, including forward looking information, to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we determine that it is likely that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is recorded to report the balance at the amount expected to be realized. At Dec. 31, 2009, we had net deferred income tax assets of $222.7 million, attributable primarily to property related items, alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards, operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits and a valuation allowance. Based primarily on historical income levels and the steady growth expectations for future earnings of the companys core utility operations, management has determined that the net deferred tax assets recorded at Dec. 31, 2009 will be realized in future periods. We believe that the accounting estimate related to deferred income taxes, and any related valuation allowance, is a critical estimate for the following reasons: 1) realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income, both operating and capital, in future periods; 2) a change in the estimated valuation reserves could have a material impact on reported assets and results of operations; and 3) administrative actions of the IRS or the U.S. Treasury or changes in law or regulation could change our deferred tax levels, including the potential for elimination or reduction of our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets (see Note 4 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. See further discussion of Uncertainty in Income Taxes in Note 4 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan (pension plan) that covers substantially all of our employees. In addition, we have unfunded non qualified, non contributory supplemental executive retirement benefit plans available to certain senior management. Several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. Key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets, salary increases and discount rates. These factors are determined by us within certain guidelines and with the help of external consultants. We consider market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. We believe that the accounting related to employee postretirement benefits is a critical accounting estimate for the following reasons: 1) a change in the estimated benefit obligation could have a material impact on reported assets, accumulated other comprehensive income and results of operations; and 2) changes in assumptions could change our annual pension funding requirements, having significant impact on our annual cash requirements. Pension plan assets (plan assets) are invested in a mix of equity and fixed income securities. The expected return on assets assumption was based on expectations of long term inflation, real growth in the economy, fixed income spreads and equity premiums consistent with our portfolio, with provision for active management and expenses paid from the trust. The discount rate assumption is based on a cash flow matching technique developed by our outside actuaries and reflects current economic conditions. This technique matches the yields from high quality (AA rated, non callable) corporate bonds to the companys projected cash flows for the pension plan to develop a present value that is converted to a discount rate assumption, which is subject to change each year. The salary increase assumption was based on the same underlying expectation of long term inflation together with assumptions regarding real growth in wages and company specific merit and promotion increases. Holding all other 59 Table of Contents assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased 2009 net income by approximately $2.8 million. Likewise, a 1.0% increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption would have resulted in an approximately $2.5 million increase or a $2.4 million decrease in 2009 net income, respectively. For 2010, a 1% increase in the discount rate assumption would result in an approximately $4.4 million decrease in the expected pension cost. A 1% decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would result in an approximately $4.4 million increase in expected pension cost. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over a period of up to 15 years, which represents the expected remaining service life of the employee group. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected return and actual returns on plan assets. These unrecognized gains and losses will be systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for pensions. Our policy is to fund the plan based on the required contribution determined by our actuaries within the guidelines set by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended. In addition, we currently provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees retiring after age 50 who meet certain service requirements. The key assumptions used in determining the amount of obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pension (OPEB), under the applicable accounting guidance, include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs. The discount rate used to determine the obligation for these benefits matched the discount rate used in determining our pension obligation in 2008; however, in 2009 we elected to determine the discount rate for the OPEB using that individual plans projected benefit cash flow rather than using the same discount rate that was determined for the pension plan. In estimating the health care cost trend rate, we consider our actual health care cost experience, future benefit structures, industry trends, and advice from our outside actuaries. We assume that the relative increase in health care cost will trend downward over the next several years, reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as Medicare Part D, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription benefit, which is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In May 2004, the FASB issued guidance that required: 1) that the effects of the federal subsidy be considered an actuarial gain and recognized in the same manner as other actuarial gains and losses and 2) certain disclosures for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. We adopted the guidance retroactive to the second quarter of 2004 for benefits provided that we believe to be actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The expected subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) at Dec. 31, 2009 by $33.0 million and increased net income for 2009 by $1.3 million. In 2009, we filed for and received a Part D subsidy of $0.9 million. The assumed health care cost trend rate for medical costs was 8.50% in 2009 and decreases to 5.00% in 2016 and thereafter. A 1% increase in the health care trend rates would have produced a 2.3% increase in the aggregate service and interest cost for 2009, which would have decreased net income $0.2 million, and a 3.6% increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of Dec. 31, 2009, the measurement date. A 1% decrease in the health care trend rates would have produced a 2.0% decrease in the aggregate service and interest cost for 2009, which would have increased net income $0.2 million, and a 2.9% decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of Dec. 31, 2009, the measurement date. The actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension and OPEB retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations. See the discussion of Employee Postretirement Benefits in Note 5 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements. Evaluation of Assets for Impairment Long Lived Assets In accordance with accounting guidance for long lived assets, we assess whether there has been an other than temporary impairment of our long lived assets and certain intangibles held and used by us when such indicators exist. We annually review all long lived assets in the last quarter of each year to ensure that any gradual change over the year and the seasonality of the markets are considered when determining which assets require an impairment analysis. We believe the accounting estimates related to asset impairments are critical estimates for the following reasons: 1) the estimates are highly susceptible to change, as management is required to make assumptions based on expectations of the results of operations for significant/indefinite future periods and or the then current market conditions in such periods; 2) markets can experience significant uncertainties; 3) the estimates are based on the ongoing expectations of management regarding probable future uses and holding periods of assets; and 4) the impact of an impairment on reported assets and earnings could be material. Our assumptions relating to future results of operations or other 60 Table of Contents recoverable amounts are based on a combination of historical experience, fundamental economic analysis, observable market activity and independent market studies. Our expectations regarding uses and holding periods of assets are based on internal long term budgets and projections, which give consideration to external factors and market forces, as of the end of each reporting period. The assumptions made are consistent with generally accepted industry approaches and assumptions used for valuation and pricing activities. At Dec. 31, 2009, there were no indications of impairment for any of the companys long lived assets. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Under the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill is not subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are subject to an annual (or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment) assessment for impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are generally determined as one level below the operating segment level; reporting units with similar characteristics are grouped for the purpose of determining the impairment, if any, of goodwill and other intangible assets. At Dec. 31, 2009, the company had $59.4 million of goodwill on its balance sheet, which is reflected in the TECO Guatemala segment. This goodwill balance arose from the purchase of multiple entities as a result of the companys investments in its San Jos&eacute; and Alborada power plants ($52.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively), and its equity investment in DECA II ($3.9 million). Since these three investments are one level below the operating segment level, discrete cash flow information is available, and management regularly reviews their operating results separately. This is the reporting unit level at which potential impairment is tested. Additionally, since San Jos&eacute; and Alborada were deconsolidated as a result of accounting guidance for variable interest entities, these were considered equity investments and any potential impairment is tested under accounting guidance for equity investments, along with TECO Guatemalas investment at DECA II (see the discussion below and Notes 17 and 18 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result of the new accounting guidance for variable interest entities effective Jan. 1, 2010, the San Jos&eacute; and Alborada project entities will be re consolidated as of Jan. 1, 2010. While these entities remain consolidated, their associated goodwill will be subject to annual assessments for impairment. Equity Investments Equity investments, including their associated goodwill, and any potential impairment are tested under the accounting guidance for equity investments. Under this guidance, an impairment charge must be recorded if the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of equity investment impairments involve the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly. Similarly, the estimates that we make with respect to our equity investments are subject to variation, and the impact of such variations could be material. Additionally, if the entities in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment of a long lived asset, we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our equity investment for an other than temporary decline in value (see Note 18 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). Regulatory Accounting Tampa Electrics and PGS retail businesses and the prices charged to customers are regulated by the FPSC. Tampa Electrics wholesale business is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). As a result, the regulated utilities qualify for the application of accounting guidance for certain types of regulation. This guidance recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise as a result of a difference between generally accepted accounting principles and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory authorities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred, as their future recovery in customer rates is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers from previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred. As a result of regulatory treatment and corresponding accounting treatment, we expect that the impact on utility costs and required investment associated with future changes in environmental regulations would create regulatory assets. Current regulation in Florida allows utility companies to recover from customers prudently incurred costs (including, for required capital investments, depreciation and a return on invested capital) for compliance with new environmental regulations through the ECRC (see the Environmental Compliance and Regulation sections). We periodically assess the probability of recovery of the regulatory assets by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes, recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction, the current political climate in the state, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities 61 Table of Contents continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. We believe the application of regulatory accounting guidance is a critical accounting policy since a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact on reported assets and the results of operations (see the Regulation section and Notes 1 and 3 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value In August 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that clarifies how to measure the fair value of a liability when there is not a quoted price in an active market for a liability. This update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using alternative techniques including, but not limited to: 1) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or 2) quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets. It was effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance. The new requirement did not have an impact on the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance that names the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP for non governmental entities recognized by the FASB. It became effective Jul. 1, 2009 and supersedes all U.S. GAAP accounting standards, aside from rules and interpretive releases issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Codification is not intended to change GAAP; rather, it changes all referencing of U.S. GAAP including the notes to financial statements. Therefore, it did not have an impact on the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance that amended the analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). It requires an enterprise to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: 1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2009. TECO Energy adopted this guidance on Jan. 1, 2010. Upon adoption, it was determined that as a result of the new approach, the company would reconsolidate the San Jos&eacute; and Alborada projects that were deconsolidated under the prior guidance. This new guidance will have an impact on the companys 2010 statement of position and cash flows, but not an impact on the results of operations. See Note 19 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Subsequent Events In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to disclose the date through which they evaluated subsequent events and whether that date corresponds with the filing of their financial statements. It became effective for fiscal periods ending after Jun. 15, 2009. The adoption did not have an impact on the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, not an entity specific measurement, and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The guidance applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The effective date was for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2007. In November of 2007, the FASB informally granted a one year deferral for non financial assets and liabilities. In February 2008, the FASB formally delayed the effective date of the fair value guidance to fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2008 for non financial assets and non financial liabilities except for items that are required to be recognized or disclosed at fair value at least annually in the companys financial statements. As a result, the company adopted the fair value guidance effective Jan. 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities and Jan. 1, 2009 for non financial assets and liabilities. No adoption adjustment was necessary. Financial assets and liabilities of the company measured at fair value include derivatives and certain investments, for which fair values are primarily based on observable inputs. Non financial assets and liabilities of the company measured at fair value include asset retirement obligations (AROs) when they are incurred and any long lived assets or equity method investments that are impaired in a currently reported period. 62 Table of Contents In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance to address fair value valuation concerns in the current market environment. The guidance addresses applying the fair value model when the market for an asset is not active, other than temporary impairments (OTTI) of debt and equity securities and interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments. When the market for an asset is not active, the newly issued guidance affirms that the objective of fair value is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date in the inactive market. The determination of whether a transaction was not orderly should be based on the weight of the evidence. An entity is required to disclose a change in valuation technique and the related inputs resulting from the application of the new guidance and to quantify its effects. Retrospective application was not permitted. The new guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending after Jun. 15, 2009. This did not have a material impact on the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. The OTTI guidance is applicable to debt securities and requires that a company recognize the credit component of an OTTI in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income if management asserts it does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. It requires an entity to present, separately in the financial statement where the components of other comprehensive income are reported, the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the noncredit portion of OTTI recognized for available for sale and held to maturity debt securities. Additionally, disclosure requirements were amended and are required for interim periods. The guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending after Jun. 15, 2009 and did not have a material impact on the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. Interim disclosures of fair value information, including methods and significant assumptions in measuring fair value, for financial instruments are required under the new guidance. The guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending after Jun. 15, 2009 and had no impact on the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures about plan assets of defined benefit pension plans or other postretirement plans, including the concentrations of risk in those plans. The guidance was effective for fiscal years ending after Dec. 15, 2009 and is significant to the companys financial statement disclosures through the provision of additional information (see Note 5 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements) but has no impact on the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance requiring that the two class method earnings per share calculation include unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether the dividend or dividend equivalents are paid or not paid. The guidance became effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2008 and had no material impact to the companys results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the disclosure framework for derivatives and hedging. Enhanced disclosures about the purpose of an entitys derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and hedged items are accounted for, and how the entitys financial position, cash flows and performance are enhanced by the derivative instruments and hedged items were required for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after Nov. 15, 2008. The guidance was significant to the companys financial statement disclosures but had no impact on its results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. Additionally, in April 2008, the FASB revised previously issued implementation guidance to reflect the enhanced disclosures required by the new guidance. These revisions are significant to the companys financial statement disclosures but have no impact on its results of operations, statement of position or cash flows. INFLATION The effects of general inflation on our results have not been significant for the past several years. The annual average rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI U), all items, all urban consumers as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor, was 2.7%, 3.8% and 2.8% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The current economic situation and the early stages of the economic recovery continue to cause the outlook for 2010 to vary widely. Reports published in The Wall Street Journal in January 2010 state that The American Bankers Association expects core inflation, which excludes fuel and food, to be 1.2% in 2010. At its January 2010 meeting, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee stated that With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. 63 Table of Contents With the rapid slowing of economies world wide in the second half of 2008 and the dramatic declines in commodity prices, especially petroleum based products, inflation dropped to almost zero in early 2009. Crude oil prices rose in the second quarter, but stabilized in a range between $70 and $80 per barrel in the second half of 2009. Tampa Electric and PGS are eligible to recover the cost of commodity fuel through the respective FPSC approved fuel adjustment clauses. In those cases where the higher costs can not be similarly recovered, higher costs could reduce the profit margins at the operating companies. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE Environmental Matters Among our companies, Tampa Electric has a number of significant stationary sources with air emissions impacted by the Clean Air Act, material Clean Water Act implications, and which may potentially be impacted by pending federal and state initiatives to adopt climate change legislation or regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Tampa Electric has undertaken major steps to dramatically reduce its air emissions through a series of voluntary actions, including technology selection (e.g., IGCC and conversion of coal fired units to natural gas fired combined cycle); implementing a responsible fuel mix taking into account price and reliability impacts to its customers; a substantial capital expenditure program to add Best Available Control Technology (BACT) emissions controls; implementation of additional controls to accomplish earlier reductions of certain emissions allowing for lower emission rates when BACT was ultimately installed; and enhanced controls and monitoring systems for certain pollutants. All of these improvements represent an investment in excess of $2 billion since 1994. Through these actions, Tampa Electric has achieved significant reductions of all air pollutants, including CO2, while maintaining a reasonable fuel mix through the clean use of coal for the economic benefit of its customers. Air Quality Control Consent Decree Tampa Electric, through voluntary negotiations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), signed a Consent Decree, which became effective Feb. 29, 2000, and a Consent Final Judgment, which became effective Dec. 6, 1999, as settlement of federal and state litigation. Pursuant to these agreements, allegations of violations of New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act were resolved, a provision was made for environmental controls and pollution reductions, and Tampa Electric began implementing a comprehensive program to dramatically decrease emissions from its power plants. The emission reduction requirements included specific detail with respect to the availability of flue gas desulfurization systems (scrubbers) to help reduce SO2, projects for NOx reduction on Big Bend Units 1 through 4, and the repowering of the coal fired Gannon Power Station to natural gas, which was renamed as the H. L. Culbreath Bayside Power Station (Bayside Power Station), in 2003 and 2004. Upon completion of the conversion the station capacity was about 1,800 megawatts (nominal) of natural gas fueled, combined cycle electric generation. The repowering has reduced the facilitys NOx and SO2 emissions by approximately 99% and particulate matter (PM) emissions by approximately 92% from 1998 levels. In 2004, Tampa Electric made its NOx reduction technology selection and decided to install SCR systems for NOx control on the coal fired Big Bend units. The first three SCR units at Big Bend Power Station were reported in service in May 2007, June 2008 and May 2009, respectively. The remaining SCR unit, Big Bend Unit 1, is expected to be in service in May 2010. The engineering and design is complete and construction of the remaining SCR system is currently in progress. Tampa Electrics capital investment forecast includes amounts in 2010 for completion of the final NOx control project (see the Capital Expenditures section). The FPSC has determined that it is appropriate for Tampa Electric to recover the operating costs of and earn a return on the investment in the SCRs to be installed on all four of the units at the Big Bend Power Station and pre SCR projects on Big Bend Units 13 (which were early plant improvements to reduce NOx emissions prior to installing the SCRs) through the ECRC (see the Regulation section). Cost recovery for the SCRs began in each of the years that the units entered service, Big Bend Unit 4 in 2007, Big Bend Unit 3 in 2008 and Big Bend Unit 2 in 2009. In November 2009 the FPSC approved cost recovery for the capital investment on the Big Bend Unit 1 SCR to start in 2010. In November 2007, Tampa Electric entered into an agreement with the EPA and DOJ for a Second Amendment to the Consent Decree. The Second Amendment: 1) establishes a 0.12 lb/MMBtu NOx limit on a 30 day rolling average for Big Bend Units 1 through 3, which is lower than the original Consent Decree that had a provision for a limit as high as 0.15 lb/MMBtu depending on certain conditions; 2) allows for the sale of NOx allowances gained as a result of surpassing the emission limit goals of the Consent Decree; and 3) calls for Tampa Electric to install a second PM Continuous Emissions Monitoring System and potentially replace the originally installed system if the new system is successful. 64 Table of Contents Emission Reductions Projects committed to under the Consent Decree and Consent Final Judgment have resulted in significant reductions in emissions. Since 1998, Tampa Electric has reduced annual SO2, NOx and PM from its facilities by 154,000 tons, 57,000 tons, and 4,000 tons, respectively. Reductions in SO2 emissions were accomplished through the installation of scrubber systems on Big Bend Units 1 and 2 in 1999. Big Bend Unit 4 was originally constructed with a scrubber. The Big Bend Unit 4 scrubber system was modified in 1994 to allow it to scrub emissions from Big Bend Unit 3 as well. Currently the scrubbers at Big Bend Power Station remove more than 95% of the SO2 emissions from the flue gas streams. The repowering of the Gannon Power Station to the Bayside Power Station has resulted in a significant reduction in emissions of all pollutant types. We expect that Tampa Electrics actions to install NOx emissions controls on all Big Bend Power Station units will result in the further reduction of emissions and that by the expected completion in May 2010, the SCR projects will result in a total phased reduction of NOx by 62,000 tons per year from 1998 levels. In total, we expect that Tampa Electrics emission reduction initiatives will result in the annual reduction of SO2, NOx and PM emissions by 88%, 90% and 71%, respectively, below 1998 levels by 2010. With these state of the art improvements in place, Tampa Electrics activities have helped to significantly enhance the quality of the air in the community. As a result of its emission reduction actions, and completion of the SCR projects, Tampa Electric has achieved emission reduction levels called for in Phase I of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). In July 2008, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated CAIR on emissions of SO2 and NOx. The federal appeals court reinstated CAIR in December 2008 as an interim solution. The EPA is continuing to work on a replacement rule that is expected to be proposed in 2010 and finalized in 2011. Until a new rule is proposed, CAIR will remain intact. Due to pollution control benefits from the environmental improvements, reductions in mercury emissions have occurred from the repowering of Gannon Power Station to Bayside Power Station. At the Bayside Power Station, where mercury levels have decreased 99% below 1998 levels, there are virtually zero mercury emissions. Additional mercury reductions are also anticipated from the installation of NOx controls at Big Bend Power Station, which are expected to lead to a reduction of mercury emissions of more than 75% from 1998 levels by 2010. The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) Phase I requirements were scheduled for implementation in 2010. CAMR was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 8, 2008. Prior to the courts decision Tampa Electric expected that it would have been in compliance with CAMR Phase I without additional capital investment. The EPA is expected to propose new or modified rules to address mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by late 2011. On Sep. 16, 2009, the EPA announced it would reconsider its 2008 decision setting national standards for ground level ozone. The EPA is reconsidering the standards to ensure they are grounded in science, protect public health with an adequate margin of safety, and are sufficient to protect the environment. Much of Tampa Electrics service territory is not expected to meet the current ground level ozone standards and will most likely be deemed to not meet national ambient air quality standards. Carbon Reductions Tampa Electric has historically supported voluntary efforts to reduce carbon emissions and has taken significant steps to reduce overall emissions at Tampa Electrics facilities. Since 1998, Tampa Electric has reduced its system wide emissions of CO2 by approximately 20%, bringing emissions to near 1990 levels. Tampa Electric expects emissions of CO2 to remain near 1990 levels until the addition of the next baseload unit, which is not expected until after 2014 (see the Tampa Electric and Capital Expenditures sections). Tampa Electric estimates that the repowering to natural gas and the shut down of the Gannon Station coal fired units resulted in an annual decrease in CO2 emissions of approximately 4.8 million tons below 1998 levels. During this same time frame, the numbers of retail customers and retail energy sales have risen by approximately 25%. Tampa Electrics voluntary activities to reduce carbon emissions also include membership in the U.S. Department of Energys Climate Challenge (now Power Partners) program since 1994, voluntary annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the Energy Information Agency (EIA) EIA 1605(b) Report beginning in 1995 and participation in the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), a voluntary but legally binding cap and trade program dedicated to reducing GHG emissions since 2003. Because of Tampa Electrics membership in the CCX, its reported CO2 emissions are audited annually by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (formerly National Association of Securities Dealers), which has certified the results thus far. In January 2008, the CCX recognized Tampa Electric for achieving its Phase I GHG participation targets for CO2 reduction. While the commitment required in Phase I was a reduction of 4% below the average of the year 1998 2001, Tampa Electric surpassed this level with an actual reduction of approximately 20%. Recently the EPA issued its Final Rule on the mandatory reporting of GHGs, requiring facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 per year to begin collecting GHG data under a new reporting system on Jan. 1, 2010, with the first annual report due Mar. 31, 2011. Tampa Electric expects to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement, in large part utilizing the same methods and procedures utilized for the voluntary activities. 65 Table of Contents Climate Change There are pending initiatives on the federal and state levels to adopt climate legislation that would require reductions in GHG emissions. At the federal level, there are several legislative proposals that would limit CO2 emissions. Most of these bills contain some type of cap and trade system with various allocation scenarios for regulated utilities, including credit for early action. While the timing of passage of any federal legislation into law remains uncertain, we will participate in the debate in an effort to ensure a comprehensive environmental approach to carbon emission reductions maintains a reliable energy supply at affordable prices. In order to meet the reduction contemplated, Tampa Electric could be required to make significant additional capital investments in technologies to reduce GHG that are not yet commercially viable. On Dec. 15, 2009, the EPA published the final Endangerment Finding in the Federal Register. Although the finding is technically being made in the context of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and does not in itself impose any requirements on industry or other entities, the finding will trigger GHG regulation of a variety of sources under the CAA. Related to utility sources, the EPA has proposed a tailoring rule rule addressing the GHG emission threshold triggers for permitting review of new and or major modifications to existing stationary sources of GHG emissions. At the state level, the Governor signed three Executive Orders in July 2007 aimed at reducing Floridas emissions of GHG. The three orders include directives for reducing GHG emissions by electric utilities to 2000 levels by 2017; to 1990 levels by 2025; and by 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050; and the creation of the Governors Action Team on Energy and Climate Change to develop a plan to achieve the targets contained in the Executive Orders including any necessary legislative initiatives required. Also in 2008, the state legislature passed broad energy and climate legislation that, among other items, affirmed the FDEPs authority to establish a utility carbon reduction schedule and a carbon dioxide cap and trade system by rule, but added a requirement for legislative ratification of the rule no sooner than January 2010. The FDEP has initiated the rule development process, but the process has slowed and is likely to be pushed out since the issue has become increasingly active at the federal level. The company is examining various options relating to its carbon emissions. In the fall of 2007, Tampa Electric announced that it would not move forward with its previously announced coal fired IGCC unit, because of the continued uncertainty related to carbon reduction regulations, particularly capture and sequestration issues. At this time, Tampa Electric expects to meet its needs for its next baseload generating capacity with natural gas fired combined cycle technology, as well as energy efficiency programs and renewable resources (see the Tampa Electric section). While natural gas has lower carbon emissions than coal, fuel prices can make natural gas generating facilities less economic than coal fired facilities. Fuel switching from coal to natural gas, absent additional sources of supply, would increase natural gas prices, further reducing the economic efficiency of natural gas generation facilities. Increased costs for electricity may cause customers to change usage patterns, which would impact Tampa Electrics sales. Tampa Electric currently emits approximately 16.6 million tons of CO2 per year. Assuming a projected long term average annual load growth of 1.0% 2.0%, Tampa Electric may emit approximately 19.8 million tons of CO2 (an increase of approximately 19%) by 2020 if natural gas fired peaking and combined cycle generation additions are used to meet growing customer needs. Tampa Electric expects that the costs to comply with new environmental regulations would be eligible for recovery through the ECRC. If approved as prudent, the costs required to comply with CO2 emissions reductions would be reflected in customers bills. If the regulation allowing cost recovery is changed and the cost of compliance is not recovered through the ECRC, Tampa Electric could seek to recover those costs through a base rate proceeding, but can not predict whether the FPSC would grant such recovery. Although Tampa Electrics current coal based generation has declined to less than 60% of its output in 2009 from 95% of its output in 2002, due primarily to the conversion of the coal fired Gannon Power Station into the natural gas fired Bayside Power Station, coal fired facilities remain a significant part of Tampa Electrics generation fleet and additional coal units could be used in the future. In the case of TECO Guatemala, the coal fired San Jos&eacute; Power Station in Guatemala is in compliance with current World Bank and Guatemalan Environmental Guidelines. While there are no known plans for legislation mandating GHG reductions in Guatemala, new rules or regulations could require additional capital investments or increase operating costs. In the case of TECO Coal, it is unclear if the requirements for CO2 emissions reductions would directly impact it as a carbon based fuel provider or the user. In either case, it could make the use of coal more expensive or less desirable, which could impact TECO Coals margins and profitability. Additional discussion related to climate change issues is included in the Risk Factors section. Renewable Energy Renewables are a component of Tampa Electrics environmental portfolio. Tampa Electrics renewable energy program offers to sell renewable energy as an option to customers and utilizes energy generated in the state from renewable sources (e.g. biomass and solar). To date, 30 million kWh of renewable energy have been produced to support participating customer requirements. 66 Table of Contents Tampa Electric has installed almost 55,000 watts of solar panels to generate electricity from the sun at three schools and the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, and continues to evaluate opportunities for additional solar panel installations. In the area of biomass, which is organic plant material from yard clippings and other vegetation, Tampa Electric has tested bahia grass as a fuel to generate electricity at the Polk Power Station where it was ground and mixed with the pulverized coal slurry used in the plants gasifier. Despite the emphasis on the use of renewable energy sources to reduce GHG in the Governors Executive Orders, the recently completed FPSC study conducted by Navigant Consulting indicates that only under the most favorable conditions of high customer incentives, a mature Renewable Energy Credit (REC) market and a high revenue rate cap would utilities hope to achieve the Governors renewable energy target. The Navigant study also found that solar photovoltaic power generation and biomass were the most viable sources of renewable energy and that Florida was a poor location for either significant land based wind generation or concentrating solar generation. While support for tax incentives for renewable energy development specific to regional disparities may facilitate the development of new sources, mandates for renewable portfolios at high percentages create concerns that RECs would have to be purchased to meet the mandate, rates for customers would grow rapidly and such mandates would not likely result in significant quantities of renewable energy sources to be developed in the state. A mandatory renewable energy portfolio standard could add to Tampa Electrics costs and adversely affect its operating results. In Florida, the executive orders tasked the FPSC with evaluating a renewable portfolio target of 20% by 2020. The 2008 Energy Bill directed the FPSC to draft a rule for a RPS to be presented to the Florida Legislature by Feb. 1, 2009, for ratification, but did not specify targets and timeframes. Under this direction, the FPSCs recommendation to the legislature is that the RPS percentage and timing be 7% by Jan. 1, 2013, 12% by Jan. 1, 2016, 18% by Jan. 1, 2019 and 20% by Jan. 1, 2021. In addition, a 2% of retail revenue cost cap was proposed, and a new clause for the recovery of costs associated with meeting the RPS standard was also proposed. Ultimately the Legislature did not ratify the rule in the 2009 session, so the rule has not taken effect. The Legislature may take up the issue in the upcoming legislative session, which could include approval of the rule as adopted by the FPSC, rejection of the rule entirely, or amendment to one or more elements of the rule. While prospects in the Legislature are uncertain, nothing can become final until further action of the FPSC after the 2010 legislative session. Although the U.S. Congress has considered, but to date has not passed, a federal RPS, there is likely to be an increased emphasis on the passage of a federal RPS. Tampa Electric could incur significant costs to comply with a high percentage renewable energy portfolio standard, as proposed, and its operating results could be adversely affected if the company were not permitted to recover these costs from customers, or if customers change usage patterns in response to increased rates. Water Supply and Quality The EPAs final Clean Water Act Section 316(b) rule became effective Jul. 9, 2004. The rule established aquatic protection requirements for existing facilities that withdraw 50 million gallons or more of water per day from rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, oceans, or other U.S. waters for cooling purposes. Tampa Electric uses water from Tampa Bay at its Bayside and Big Bend facilities as cooling water. Both plants use mesh screens to reduce the adverse impacts to aquatic organisms and Big Bend units 3 and 4 use proprietary fine mesh screens, the best available technology, to further reduce impacts to aquatic organisms. Subsequent to promulgation of the rule, a number of states, environmental groups and others sought judicial review of the rule. On Jan. 25, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the rule to the EPA for revisions. Among other things, the court rejected the EPAs use of cost benefit analysis and suggested some ways to incorporate cost considerations. The Supreme Court agreed to review the Second Circuits decision and heard arguments in December 2008. EPA decided to rewrite the rule, and expects to propose a new rule in 2010. The full impact of the new regulations will depend on subsequent legal proceedings, the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules implementation, and the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies. On Jan. 14, 2009, the EPA released a letter stating that it had made a determination that numeric nutrient water quality criteria is necessary in Florida to implement the Clean Water Act and established a deadline of Jan. 14, 2010 to propose criteria for lakes and streams, and Jan. 14, 2011 for estuaries. The EPAs proposed criteria for lakes and streams was published in the form of a proposed rule in the Federal Register on Jan. 26, 2010. This proposed rule has the potential to affect Polk Power Stations cooling reservoir discharge to surface waters, and may require the station to reduce the amount of nutrients in the cooling reservoir water before discharge. The proposed rule is subject to public comments and the language may be modified as a result of comments or reconsidered by the EPA. The provisions of the final rule will not be known until the final rule is published and becomes effective. The full effect of the EPAs criteria for lakes and streams will depend on the outcome of the rulemaking and future legal proceedings. The Big Bend, Bayside and Polk Power stations also use water on a daily basis to generate electricity with steam and to operate its scrubbers to reduce SO2 emissions. Water recycling and beneficial reuse programs are widely employed in the fresh water systems at all three power stations to reduce demand on higher cost water sources such as municipal water systems. Conservation Energy conservation is becoming increasingly important in a period of volatile energy prices and in the GHG emissions reduction debate. In 2007, the Governor signed three Executive Orders aimed at reducing Floridas emissions of GHG, which included a directive for the development of new policies to enhance energy efficiency and conservation statewide. The Climate Action Team described above completed a final report by the October 2008 deadline and included policy recommendations on 67 Table of Contents energy efficiency and conservation targets which may either be used in the development of new legislation or in the augmentation of existing FPSC regulation. Tampa Electric offers customers 27 comprehensive programs to conserve energy. These programs are designed to reduce peak energy demand which allows Tampa Electric to delay construction of future generation facilities. Since their inception, these conservation programs have reduced the summer peak demand by 232 megawatts, and the winter peak demand by 660 megawatts. PGS offers customers programs to switch to higher efficiency natural gas appliances from older electric power appliances. These programs and their costs are approved annually by the FPSC with the costs recovered through a clause on the customers bill. In 2007, the FPSC approved the modification of nine existing programs and the addition of 13 new conservation programs. Following a two year pilot program, the FPSC approved the Energy Planner program, which is a program aimed at residential customers that is expected to reduce summer peak demand by 22 megawatts, winter demand by 28 megawatts and annual energy consumption by almost 10,000 megawatt hours. In addition, PGS offers programs that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, with the costs recovered through customers bills. In December 2009, the FPSC established new demand side management (DSM) goals for 2010 2019 for all investor owned electric utilities. For Tampa Electric, the summer and winter demand goals are 138 and 109 megawatts, respectively, and the annual energy goal is 360 gigawatt hours. These goals are very aggressive and represent as much as a 300 percent increase over the companys previous goals. Tampa Electric is actively developing its overall DSM plan with its associated new and modified programs designed to meet the new goals. The DSM plan filing is due to the FPSC on Mar. 30, 2010 with an expected ruling for approval in June 2010. Implementation of the plan will immediately follow the ruling. Superfund and Former Manufactured Gas Plant Sites Tampa Electric Company, through its Tampa Electric and PGS divisions, is a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain superfund sites and, through its PGS division, for certain former manufactured gas plant sites. While the joint and several liability associated with these sites presents the potential for significant response costs, as of Dec. 31, 2009, Tampa Electric Company has estimated its ultimate financial liability to be approximately $19.9 million (primarily related to PGS), and this amount has been reflected in the companys financial statements. This amount is higher than prior estimates to reflect a 2009 study for the costs of remediation primarily related to one site. The environmental remediation costs associated with these sites, which are expected to be paid over many years, are not expected to have a significant impact on customer prices. The amounts represent only the estimated portion of the cleanup costs attributable to Tampa Electric Company. The estimates to perform the work are based on actual estimates obtained from contractors or Tampa Electric Companys experience with similar work, adjusted for site specific conditions and agreements with the respective governmental agencies. The estimates are made in current dollars, are not discounted and do not assume any insurance recoveries. Allocation of the responsibility for remediation costs among Tampa Electric Company and other PRPs is based on each partys relative ownership interest in or usage of a site. Accordingly, Tampa Electric Companys share of remediation costs varies with each site. In virtually all instances where other PRPs are involved, those PRPs are considered credit worthy. Factors that could impact these estimates include the ability of other PRPs to pay their pro rata portion of the cleanup costs, additional testing and investigation which could expand the scope of the cleanup activities, additional liability that might arise from the cleanup activities themselves or changes in laws or regulations that could require additional remediation. Under current regulation, these additional costs would be eligible for recovery through customer rates. Coal Combustion By products Recycling The combustion of coal at two of Tampa Electrics power generating facilities, the Big Bend and Polk Power stations, produces ash and other by products, collectively known as Coal Combustion Byproducts (CCBs). The CCBs produced at Big Bend includes fly ash, gypsum, boiler slag, bottom ash and economizer ash. The CCBs produced at the Polk Power Station include gasifier slag and sulfuric acid. Overall, over 98% of all CCBs produced at these facilities were marketed to customers for beneficial use in commercial and industrial products in 2009. In response to the TVA Kingston coal ash pond failure that occurred in December 2008, the EPA announced that it would propose new regulations for the management and disposal of CCBs. These rules, which are expected to be published in the Federal Register in the first quarter of 2010, may include a designation of CCBs as a new category of hazardous wastes. In addition, these new rules may prohibit construction of new unlined by product storage ponds and place additional management requirements on existing ash ponds such as those at Big Bend. However, we do not expect that this provision would adversely affect Tampa Electric, since all of its CCB storage areas are either lined or are in the process of being lined in accordance with current requirements. REGULATION The retail operations of Tampa Electric and PGS are regulated by the FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, quality of service and reliability, issuances of securities, planning, siting and construction of facilities, accounting and depreciation practices, and other matters. 68 Table of Contents In general, the FPSCs pricing objective is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost of providing service, plus a reasonable return on invested capital. For both Tampa Electric and PGS, the costs of owning, operating and maintaining the utility system, other than fuel, purchased power, conservation and certain environmental costs, are recovered through base rates. These costs include operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on investment in assets used and useful in providing electric and natural gas distribution services (rate base). The rate of return on rate base, which is intended to approximate the individual companys weighted cost of capital, primarily includes its costs for debt, deferred income taxes at a zero cost rate and an allowed return on common equity. Base rates are determined in FPSC rate setting hearings which occur at irregular intervals at the initiative of Tampa Electric, PGS, the FPSC or other parties. Tampa Electric is also subject to regulation by the FERC in various respects, including wholesale power sales, certain wholesale power purchases, transmission and ancillary services, and accounting practices. Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations cover air quality, water quality, land use, power plant, substation and transmission line siting, noise and aesthetics, security of electric system operating infrastructure, computer systems, customer and employee related data, solid waste and other environmental matters (see the Environmental Compliance section). Tampa Electric Base Rates Tampa Electrics rates and allowed return on equity (ROE) range of 10.25% to 12.25%, with a midpoint of 11.25%, are in effect until such time as changes are occasioned by an agreement approved by the FPSC or other FPSC actions as a result of rate or other proceedings initiated by Tampa Electric, FPSC staff or other interested parties. Before August 2008, Tampa Electric had not sought a base rate increase since 1992. As a result of lower customer growth, lower energy sales growth, and average annual capital investments of more than $350 million annually over the past nine years, Tampa Electrics 13 month average regulatory ROE was 8.7% at the end of 2008. Recognizing the significant decline in ROE, Tampa Electric filed for a $228.2 million base rate increase in August 2008. In March 2009, the FPSC approved a $104.3 million increase in annual base rates, authorizing a new ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25% with a mid point of 11.25% and an equity ratio of 54.0% for rates effective in May 2009. The Commission also authorized a $33.5 million change in base rates effective Jan. 1, 2010 to recover the cost of five peaking combustion turbines and solid fuel rail unloading facilities at the Big Bend Station, subject to the conditions that the investments were in commercial operation by Dec. 31, 2009 and the five peaking combustion turbines are needed to serve customers. The FPSC later clarified that it would perform an audit to review the continuing need for the CTs and the costs incurred to place the CTs and rail unloading facilities in service. In July, in response to a motion for reconsideration, the FPSC determined that adjustments to the capital structure used to calculate the new rates should have been calculated over all sources of capital rather than only investor sources. This change resulted in a $9.3 million increase in revenue requirements for a total 2009 increase of $113.6 million, and an additional $0.5 million in 2010. At the same time the FPSC voted to reject the intervenors joint motion requesting reconsideration of the 2010 portion of base rates approved in 2009. In September, the intervenors filed a joint appeal to the Florida Supreme Court related to the FPSCs decision to reject their motion for reconsideration of the 2010 portion of base rates approved in 2009. The FPSC and Tampa Electric will oppose this appeal. The intervenors filed appellate briefs on Feb. 24, 2010. There is no specific time frame for a resolution. In December 2009, the FPSC approved Tampa Electrics petition requesting that the proposed rates to support the CTs and rail unloading facilities be put into effect Jan. 1, 2010. At that time, the FPSC determined that, based on its staff audit of the actual costs incurred, the portion of base rates approved in 2009 should be reduced by $8.4 million to $25.7 million, subject to refund. A regulatory proceeding will be held during 2010 regarding the continuing need for the CTs, the appropriate amount to be recovered and the resulting rates. Subject to final FPSC approval, the hearing is tentatively set for the first week of September 2010. Tampa Electric Cost Recovery Clauses Fuel, purchased power, conservation and certain environmental costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges established pursuant to the FPSCs cost recovery clauses. These charges, which are reset annually in an FPSC proceeding, are based on estimated costs of fuel, environmental compliance, conservation programs and purchased power and estimated customer usage for a specific recovery period, with a true up adjustment to reflect the variance of actual costs from the projected costs. The FPSC may disallow recovery of any costs that it considers imprudently incurred. In November 2008, the FPSC approved Tampa Electrics originally requested 2009 fuel rates. The rates included the costs for natural gas and coal expected in 2009, and the recovery of fuel and purchased power expenses, which were not collected in 2008. In March 2009, Tampa Electric filed a mid course correction with the FPSC to adjust its projected 2009 fuel and purchased power 69 Table of Contents costs to reflect the decline in commodity fuel prices, primarily natural gas. The revised forecast reduced fuel and purchased power costs by $191 million for 2009, which when combined with $35 million over recovery in late 2008, resulted in a $226 million lower projected fuel and purchased power cost. With the FPSC approved lower projected fuel and power costs combined with the 2009 base rate increase described above, a 1,000 kWh monthly residential bill decreased 11% to $114.67. In September 2009, Tampa Electric filed with the FPSC for approval of cost recovery rates for fuel and purchased power, capacity, environmental and conservation costs for the period January through December 2010. In November 2009, the FPSC approved Tampa Electrics requested rates. The rates include the cost for natural gas, oil and coal expected in 2010, the net over recovery of fuel, purchased power and capacity clause expenses, which were collected in 2009 following the March adjustment, and the operating cost for and a return on the capital invested in the fourth SCR project to enter service on Big Bend Unit 1 as well as the operation and maintenance expense associated with the project as required by the EPA Consent Decree and FDEP Consent Final Judgment (see the Environmental Compliance section). Rates in 2010 also reflect a two block residential fuel factor structure with a lower factor for the first 1,000 kilowatt hours used each month. Including the effects of the 2010 base rate change approved in December 2009, discussed above, Tampa Electrics residential customer rate per 1,000 kilowatt hours decreased $1.94 from $114.67 in 2009 to $112.73 in 2010. The FPSC determined that it was appropriate for Tampa Electric to recover SCR operating costs through the ECRC as well as earn a return on its SCR investment installed on the Big Bend coal fired units for NOx control in compliance with the environmental consent decree. The SCR for Big Bend Unit 4 was reported in service in May 2007, the SCR for Big Bend Unit 3 was reported in service in June 2008, the SCR for Big Bend Unit 2 was reported in service in May 2009 and cost recovery started in the respective in service years. The SCR for Big Bend Unit 1 is scheduled to enter service by May 1, 2010. Coal Transportation Contract In 2003, following a request for proposal process, Tampa Electric executed a new five year contract with TECO Transport, (at the time an affiliated company, now United Maritime, an unaffiliated company) effective Jan. 1, 2004, for waterborne coal transportation and storage services at market rates. Hearings regarding the prudence of the RFP process and final contract were held and a final order on the matter was issued in October 2004, which reduced the annual amount Tampa Electric could recover from its customers through the fuel adjustment clause for the water transportation services for coal and petroleum coke provided by TECO Transport. The annual disallowance was $8 million to $10 million, depending on the volumes and origination points of the coal shipments, which is reflected in our results. To settle a dispute with the FPSC that arose in 2008 over the calculation of the waterborne transportation disallowance over its five year life, Tampa Electric recorded a $1.9 million charge in 2008 (see the Tampa Electric section). Tampa Electric issued a RFP for solid fuel transportation services in October 2007. Tampa Electric structured the RFP to comply with the FPSC order issued in October 2004. New contracts for solid fuel deliveries were executed with United Maritime, AEP Memco and CSX Railroad prior to the expiration of the then existing contract with United Maritime on Dec. 31, 2008. The rail service contract provides Tampa Electric with bimodal capability for solid fuel transportation, which the FPSC had encouraged Tampa Electric to pursue, with the 2009 completion of construction of rail unloading facilities at Big Bend Power Station (see the Liquidity, Capital Resources section). In its November 2009 fuel hearings, the FPSC approved the full recovery of rates for 2010 that included the costs associated with the contracts described above. Hardening of Transmission and Distribution Facilities Due to extensive storm damage to utility facilities during the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons and the resulting outages utility customers experienced throughout the state, the FPSC initiated a proceeding to explore methods of designing, building and strengthening transmission and distribution systems that would minimize long term outages and restoration costs. The FPSC subsequently issued an order requiring all investor owned utilities (IOUs) to implement a 10 point storm preparedness plan designed to improve the statewide electric infrastructure to better withstand severe storms and expedite recovery from future storms. Tampa Electric has implemented its plan and estimates the average incremental non fuel operation and maintenance expense of this plan to be approximately $20 million annually. The FPSC also modified its rule regarding the design standards for new and replacement transmission and distribution line construction, including certain critical circuits in a utilitys system. Future capital expenditures required under the storm hardening program are expected to average approximately $20 million annually for the foreseeable future. Floridas Energy Plan The FDEP has produced an energy plan for the state that, among other initiatives, encourages fuel diversity for electric generation, streamlining of the power plant siting review process, conservation by state agencies and consumers, educational programs for residential and business customers regarding energy conservation, expansion of the use of hydrogen and additional grants to study alternative energy supplies (see the Environmental Compliance section). 70 Table of Contents Utility Competition Electric Tampa Electrics retail electric business is substantially free from direct competition with other electric utilities, municipalities and public agencies. At the present time, the principal form of competition at the retail level consists of self generation available to larger users of electric energy. Such users may seek to expand their alternatives through various initiatives, including legislative and or regulatory changes that would permit competition at the retail level. Tampa Electric intends to retain and expand its retail business by managing costs and providing high quality service to retail customers. Presently there is competition in Floridas wholesale power markets among Floridas utilities and from other suppliers of electricity largely as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and related federal initiatives. However, the states Power Plant Siting Act, which sets the states electric energy and environmental policy and governs the building of new generation involving steam capacity of 75 megawatts or more, requires that applicants demonstrate that a plant is needed prior to receiving construction and operating permits. FPSC rules require IOUs to issue RFPs prior to filing a petition for Determination of Need for construction of a power plant with a steam cycle greater than 75 megawatts. The rules provide a mechanism for expedited dispute resolution, allow bidders to submit new bids whenever the IOU revises its cost estimates for its self build option, require IOUs to disclose the methodology and criteria to be used to evaluate the bids, and provide more stringent standards for the IOUs to recover cost overruns in the event the self build option is deemed the most cost effective. PGS Rates PGS previous base rates, which became effective in January 2003, were agreed to in a settlement with all parties involved. PGS 2003 authorized rates provided an allowed ROE range from 10.25% to 12.25% with an 11.25% midpoint. At the end of 2007, PGS 13 month average regulatory ROE was below the bottom of its allowed range as a result of higher operating costs, continued investment in the distribution system and higher costs associated with required safety requirements, such as transmission and distribution pipeline integrity management. Recognizing the significant decline in ROE, PGS filed for a $26.5 million base rate increase in August 2008. In May 2009, the FPSC approved a $19.2 million increase in annual base rates, authorizing a new ROE range of 9.75% to 11.75% with a mid point of 10.75% and an equity ratio of 54.7% for rates effective in June 2009. PGS Cost Recovery Clauses PGS recovers the costs it pays for gas supply and interstate transportation for system supply through the PGA clause. This charge is designed to recover the costs incurred by PGS for purchased gas, and for holding and using interstate pipeline capacity for the transportation of gas it delivers to its customers. These charges may be adjusted monthly based on a cap approved annually in an FPSC hearing. The cap is based on estimated costs of purchased gas and pipeline capacity, and estimated customer usage for a specific recovery period, with a true up adjustment to reflect the variance of actual costs and usage from the projected charges for prior periods. In November 2009, the FPSC approved rates under PGS PGA for the period January 2010 through December 2010 for the recovery of the costs of natural gas purchased for its distribution customers. In addition to its base rates and purchased gas adjustment clause charges, PGS customers (except interruptible customers) also pay a per therm conservation charge for all gas. This charge is intended to permit PGS to recover its costs incurred in developing and implementing energy conservation programs, which are mandated by Florida law and approved and supervised by the FPSC. PGS is permitted to recover, on a dollar for dollar basis, prudently incurred expenditures made in connection with these programs if it demonstrates that the programs are cost effective for its ratepayers. Utility Competition Gas Although PGS is not in direct competition with any other regulated distributors of natural gas for customers within its service areas, there are other forms of competition. At the present time, the principal form of competition for residential and small commercial customers is from companies providing other sources of energy, including electricity, propane and fuel oil. PGS has taken actions to retain and expand its natural gas distribution business, including managing costs and providing high quality service to customers. In Florida, gas service is unbundled for all non residential customers. PGS has a NaturalChoice program, offering unbundled transportation service to all eligible customers and allowing non residential customers to purchase commodity gas from a third party but continue to pay PGS for the transportation. As a result, PGS receives its base rate for distribution regardless of whether a customer decides to opt for transportation only service or continue bundled service. PGS had approximately 15,200 transportation customers as of Dec. 31, 2009 out of approximately 31,400 eligible customers. Competition is most prevalent in the large commercial and industrial markets. In recent years, these classes of customers have been targeted by companies seeking to sell gas directly by transporting gas through other facilities and thereby bypassing PGS facilities. In response to this competition, PGS has developed various programs, including the provision of transportation services at discounted rates. 71 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Risk Management Infrastructure We are subject to various types of market risk in the course of daily operations, as discussed below. We have adopted an enterprise wide approach to the management and control of market and credit risk. Middle Office risk management functions, including credit risk management and risk control, are independent of each transacting entity (Front Office). Our Risk Management Policy (Policy) governs all energy transacting activity at the TECO Energy group of companies. The Policy is approved by our Board of Directors and administered by a Risk Authorizing Committee (RAC) that is comprised of senior management. Within the bounds of the Policy, the RAC approves specific hedging strategies, new transaction types or products, limits, and transacting authorities. Transaction activity is reported daily and measured against limits. For all commodity risk management activities, derivative transaction volumes are limited to the anticipated volume for customer sales or supplier procurement activities. The RAC administers the Policy with respect to interest rate risk exposures. Under the Policy, the RAC operates and oversees transaction activity. Interest rate derivative transaction activity is directly correlated to borrowing activities. Risk Management Objectives The Front Office is responsible for reducing and mitigating the market risk exposures which arise from the ownership of physical assets and contractual obligations, such as debt instruments and firm customer sales contracts. The primary objectives of the risk management organization, the Middle Office, are to quantify, measure, and monitor the market risk exposures arising from the activities of the Front Office and the ownership of physical assets. In addition, the Middle Office is responsible for enforcing the limits and procedures established under the approved risk management policies. Based on the policies approved by the companys Board of Directors and the procedures established by the RAC, from time to time, members of the TECO Energy group of companies enter into futures, forwards, swaps and option contracts to limit the exposure to: Price fluctuations for physical purchases and sales of natural gas in the course of normal operations at Tampa Electric and PGS; Interest rate fluctuations on debt at TECO Energy and its affiliates; and Price fluctuations for physical purchases of fuel at TECO Coal. The TECO Energy companies use derivatives only to reduce normal operating and market risks, not for speculative purposes. Our primary objective in using derivative instruments for regulated operations is to reduce the impact of market price volatility on ratepayers. For unregulated operations, the companies use derivative instruments primarily to mitigate the price uncertainty related to commodity inputs, such as diesel fuel. Derivatives and Hedge Accounting Accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires us and our affiliates to recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements, to measure those instruments at fair value, and to reflect the changes in the fair value of those instruments as components of other comprehensive income or net income, depending on the designation of those instruments. Designation of a hedging relationship requires management to make assumptions about the future probability of the timing and amount of the hedged transaction and the future effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting the change in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. The determination of fair value is dependent upon certain assumptions and judgments, as described more fully below (see Note 22 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). Fair Value Measurements Effective Jan. 1, 2008, the company adopted accounting standards for fair value measurement. These standards define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, and expand disclosures about financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value. The majority of the companys financial assets and liabilities are in the form of natural gas, heating oil and interest rate derivatives classified as cash flow hedges and auction rate securities. This adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or capital. Most natural gas derivatives were entered into by the regulated utilities to manage the impact of natural gas prices on customers. As a result of applying the provisions of accounting standards for regulated activities, the changes in value of natural gas derivatives of Tampa Electric and PGS are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities to reflect the impact of the risks of hedging activities in the fuel recovery clause. Because the amounts are deferred and ultimately collected through the fuel clause, the unrealized gains and losses associated with the valuation of these assets and liabilities do not impact our results of operations. 72 Table of Contents Interest rate derivatives at the regulated utilities were entered into in 2007 as a cash flow hedge to reduce exposure to interest rate changes for debt that was issued in 2008. The $11.8 million settlement of these instruments at the time the debt was issued, May of 2008, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized to earnings over the life of the related debt which matures on May 15, 2018. Heating oil hedges are used to mitigate the fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel which is a significant component in the cost of coal production at TECO Coal and its subsidiaries. The valuation methods we used to determine fair value are described in Note 22 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Risk We have a rigorous process for the establishment of new trading counterparties. This process includes an evaluation of each counterpartys financial statements, with particular attention paid to liquidity and capital resources; establishment of counterparty specific credit limits; optimization of credit terms; and execution of standardized enabling agreements. Our Credit Guidelines require transactions with counterparties below investment grade to be collateralized. Contracts with different legal entities affiliated with the same counterparty are consolidated for credit purposes and managed as appropriate, considering the legal structure and any netting agreements in place. Credit exposures are calculated, compared to limits and reported to management on a daily basis. The Credit Guidelines are administered and monitored within the Middle Office, independent of the Front Office. We have implemented procedures to monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties and to consider nonperformance in valuing counterparty positions. Net liability positions are generally not adjusted as we use our derivative transactions as hedges and we have the ability and intent to perform under each of our contracts. In the instance of net asset positions, we consider general market conditions and the observable financial health and outlook of specific counterparties, forward looking data such as credit default swaps when available and historical default probabilities from credit rating agencies in evaluating the potential impact of nonperformance risk to derivative positions. Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require our debt, or in the case of derivative instruments where Tampa Electric Company is the counterparty, Tampa Electric Companys debt, to maintain an investment grade credit rating from any or all of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings, including Tampa Electric Companys, were to fall below investment grade it could trigger these provisions, and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features that are in a liability position on Dec. 31, 2009, was $36.7 million, including Tampa Electric Company positions of $35.9 million. If the credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered as of Dec. 31, 2009, we could have been required to post collateral or settle existing positions with counterparties totaling $36.7 million. In the unlikely event that this situation would occur, we believe that we maintain adequate lines of credit to meet these obligations. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of our borrowing activities. We may enter into futures, swaps and option contracts, in accordance with the approved risk management policies and procedures, to moderate this exposure to interest rate changes and achieve a desired level of fixed and variable rate debt. As of Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, a hypothetical 10% increase in the consolidated groups weighted average interest rate on its variable rate debt during the subsequent year would not result in a material impact on pretax earnings. This is driven by the low amounts of variable rate debt at TECO Energy and at our subsidiaries. These amounts were determined based on the variable rate obligations existing on the indicated dates at TECO Energy and its subsidiaries. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair market value of our long term debt by approximately 2.7% at Dec. 31, 2009 and 4.0% at Dec. 31, 2008 (see the Financing Activity section and Notes 6 and 7 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements). The above sensitivities assume no changes to our financial structure and could be affected by changes in our credit ratings, changes in general economic conditions or other external factors (see the Risk Factors section). Commodity Risk We and our affiliates face varying degrees of exposure to commodity risks including coal, natural gas, fuel oil, and other energy commodity prices. Any changes in prices could affect the prices these businesses charge, their operating costs and the 73 Table of Contents competitive position of their products and services. We assess and monitor risk using a variety of measurement tools. Management uses different risk measurement and monitoring tools based on the degree of exposure of each operating company to commodity risks. Regulated Utilities Historically, Tampa Electrics fuel costs used for generation were affected primarily by the price of coal and, to a lesser degree, the cost of natural gas and fuel oil. With the repowering of the Bayside Power Station, the use of natural gas, with its more volatile pricing, has increased substantially. PGS has exposure related to the price of purchased gas and pipeline capacity. Currently, Tampa Electrics and PGS commodity price risk is largely mitigated by the fact that increases in the price of fuel and purchased power are recovered through cost recovery clauses, with no anticipated effect on earnings. However, increasing fuel cost recovery has the potential to affect total energy usage and the relative attractiveness of electricity and natural gas to consumers. To moderate the impacts of fuel price changes on customers, both Tampa Electric and PGS manage commodity price risk by entering into long term fuel supply agreements, prudently operating plant facilities to optimize cost, and entering into derivative transactions designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of wholesale natural gas. At Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, a change in commodity prices would not have had a material impact on earnings for Tampa Electric or PGS, but could have had an impact on the timing of the cash recovery of the cost of fuel (see the Tampa Electric and Regulation sections). Unregulated Operating Companies Our unregulated operating companies, TECO Coal and TECO Guatemala, are subject to significant commodity risk. The operating companies do not speculate using derivative instruments. However, all derivative instruments may not receive hedge accounting treatment due to the strict requirements and narrow applicability of the accounting rules to dynamic transactions. TECO Coal is exposed to commodity price risk through coal sales as a part of its daily operations. Where possible and economical, TECO Coal enters into fixed price sales transactions to mitigate variability in coal prices. TECO Coal is also exposed to variability in operating costs as a result of periodic purchases of diesel oil in its operations. At Dec. 31, 2009, TECO Coal had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price variability for its anticipated 2010 diesel oil purchases for nearly all coal production volumes sold under contracts that did not include a fuel price component. Accordingly, a change in the average annual price for diesel oil is not expected to significantly change TECO Coals cost of production. Like Tampa Electric and PGS, TECO Guatemala has commodity price risk that is largely mitigated by the fact that increases in the price of fuel are passed through to the power purchasing distribution utility. However, changes in the relative cost of coal fired and oil fired generation in Guatemala can have a substantial impact on the dispatch frequency of TECO Guatemalas units and its ability to achieve incremental spot market sales.
