ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION WPS Resources Corporation is a holding company. Our wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Upper Peninsula Power Company. Another wholly owned subsidiary, WPS Resources Capital Corporation, is a holding company for our nonregulated businesses including WPS Energy Services, Inc. and WPS Power Development, Inc. 2001 Compared with 2000 WPS Resources Corporation Overview WPS Resources 2001 and 2000 results of operations are shown in the following chart: WPS Resources Results (Millions, except share amounts) 2001 2000 Change Consolidated operating revenues $2,675.5 $1,949.0 37% Income available for common shareholders $77.6 $67.0 16% Basic earnings per share $2.75 $2.53 9% Diluted earnings per share $2.74 $2.53 8% Consolidated operating revenues increased due to sales volume growth for all business segments and higher natural gas prices in the first part of 2001. In addition, rate increases at Wisconsin Public Service contributed to increased revenues in 2001. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized a 5.4% increase in Wisconsin retail electric rates and a 1.5% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective January 1, 2001. Increased profitability at our nonregulated segments offset a decrease in earnings at our electric and natural gas utility segments resulting in improved earnings in 2001. A gain on the sale of hydro lands as part of our asset management strategy, increased natural gas and electric utility margins, increased electric and natural gas margins at WPS Energy Services, additional tax credits at WPS Power Development and a gain on the sale of a portion of WPS Power Developments investment in its synthetic fuel operation contributed to higher earnings. Partially offsetting these factors were increased operating expenses at all segments and a lower margin at WPS Power Development. Overview of Utility Operations Utility operations include the electric utility operations at Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power and the natural gas utility operations at Wisconsin Public Service. Income from electric utility operations was $58.8 million in 2001 compared with $60.7 million in 2000. Income from gas utility operations was $8.9 million in 2001 and $11.6 million in 2000. Electric Utility Operations The consolidated electric utility margin represents electric revenue less cost of sales exclusive of intercompany transactions. Our consolidated electric utility margin increased $11.4 million, or 3%, primarily due to a 5.4% Wisconsin retail electric rate increase at Wisconsin Public Service which became effective on January 1, 2001. Electric Utility Results (Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $654.4 $623.8 $582.5 Fuel and purchased power 218.2 199.0 187.4 Margin $436.2 $424.8 $395.1 Sales in kilowatt hours 12,741,024 12,565,011 12,503,487 The consolidated electric utility margin increased due to the electric rate increase at Wisconsin Public Service and higher sales volumes to most customer classes at Upper Peninsula Power and Wisconsin Public Service. Summer weather was 66% warmer in 2001 than in 2000, and 17% warmer than normal. Partially offsetting these factors was a 2% decrease in sales to large commercial and industrial customers at Wisconsin Public Service due to declining economic conditions. Affecting the electric utility margin was a change in the customer mix at Wisconsin Public Service. Sales to lower margin, non firm customers increased more than sales to higher margin customers. The lack of new retail electric rates at Upper Peninsula Power also affected the margin negatively. Upper Peninsula Powers application for a $5.7 million rate increase which had been pending before the Michigan Public Service Commission since October 2000 was dismissed in August 2001 at Upper Peninsula Powers request. Upper Peninsula Power requested a dismissal because the information filed in the case was outdated. Upper Peninsula Power intends to submit a new application for rate increases in 2002. Our consolidated fuel expense for production plants decreased $5.2 million, or 4%, largely due to decreased production at Wisconsin Public Services combustion turbine generation plants. Our consolidated purchased power expense, however, increased $24.4 million due to an increase in power purchases and a 19% increase in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by Wisconsin Public Service in 2001 compared with 2000. Power purchases were 21% higher in 2001 due to warmer summer weather and the availability of economically priced energy. Also contributing to increased power purchases were a scheduled outage at Wisconsin Public Services nuclear plant and an unscheduled outage at one of its fossil fueled generation plants. Wisconsin Public Services Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant was off line for a scheduled refueling and replacement of its steam generators which began in late September of 2001. The Kewaunee plant returned to service in early December as scheduled. Wisconsin Public Service is currently a 59% owner of the Kewaunee plant. Wisconsin Public Services Pulliam Unit 7 was off line for unscheduled repairs in the fourth quarter of 2001 and returned to service on February 3, 2002. Wisconsin Public Service chose to take advantage of purchased power during these outages because of economically favorable pricing. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows Wisconsin Public Service the opportunity to adjust prospectively the amount billed to Wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range. Wisconsin Public Service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus 2% from forecasted costs on an annualized basis. In the third quarter of 2001, Wisconsin Public Service submitted a fuel filing with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin requesting a $1.9 million retail electric rate reduction. The rate reduction was approved and implemented on September 3, 2001. Wisconsin Public Service submitted an additional fuel filing in November 2001, and a rate reduction of $0.3 million was approved and implemented on December 8, 2001. Gas Utility Operations The consolidated gas utility margin represents natural gas revenues less purchases exclusive of intercompany transactions. Effective April 1, 2001, the gas utility margin at Wisconsin Public Service includes the merged Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company operations. Wisconsin Public Service Corporations Gas Utility Results (Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $321.6 $264.5 $191.5 Purchase costs 230.2 185.1 117.6 Margin $ 91.4 $ 79.4 $ 73.9 Throughput in therms 742,722 701,094 662,615 The gas utility margin at Wisconsin Public Service increased $12.0 million, or 15%, in 2001. This increase was due to a 1.5% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective January 1, 2001, and higher overall natural gas throughput volumes of 6%. Increased gas throughput volumes were largely the result of Wisconsin Public Services acquisition of Wisconsin Fuel and Light in the second quarter of 2001. Gas throughput volumes to large commercial and industrial customers, however, decreased 9% as a result of customers switching to the gas transport customer class and declining economic conditions. Gas throughput volumes to gas transport customers increased 15%. In addition, gas throughput volumes to interruptible customers decreased 6%. Gas throughput volumes were negatively affected by winter weather which was 9% milder in 2001 than in 2000, and 8% milder than normal. Wisconsin Public Services natural gas revenues increased $57.1 million, or 22%, as the result of an increase in the average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of 2001, increased throughput, and the 1.5% increase in Wisconsin retail gas rates. Wisconsin Public Services natural gas purchase costs increased $45.1 million, or 24%, largely due to a higher average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of 2001. The higher natural gas prices experienced earlier in 2001 were passed on to customers and are reflected in both revenues and gas purchases, thus having little impact on margin. Under current regulatory practice, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Michigan Public Service Commission allow Wisconsin Public Service to pass changes in the cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause. Other Utility Expenses/Income Utility operating expenses increased $36.3 million largely due to increased transmission expenses associated with the transfer of assets to American Transmission Company, increased payments to the Wisconsin Department of Administration for demand side management (energy conservation) activities, increased maintenance costs at the Kewaunee plant during its refueling outage, and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has allowed a portion of the higher transmission costs to be deferred. The deferred transmission costs, $4.4 million for 2001, are expected to be recovered in future regulatory proceedings. Lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund contributed to a decrease in other income from utility operations. Due to regulatory practice, lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund were offset by decreased depreciation expense. Also contributing to decreased depreciation expense were an extension in the Kewaunee plants assumed depreciable life and a reduction in the nuclear decommissioning fund contribution. Interest expense increased due to the issuance of additional long term debt by Wisconsin Public Service in August of 2001. Overview of Nonregulated Operations Nonregulated operations consist of the natural gas, electric, and other sales at WPS Energy Services, a diversified energy supply and services company and the operations of WPS Power Development, an electric generation asset development company. WPS Energy Services net income increased to $6.4 million in 2001 compared with $1.7 million in 2000. WPS Power Developments net income increased to $2.3 million in 2001 compared with $0.9 million in 2000. Overview of WPS Energy Services WPS Energy Services principal business involves nonregulated gas sales. In addition, nonregulated electric sales have become an important factor in the growth of WPS Energy Services. Revenues at WPS Energy Services grew to $1,575.1 million in 2001 compared with $955.6 million in 2000, an increase of 65%. This increase was the result of additional natural gas and electric sales volumes coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas in the first half of 2001. The higher unit cost of natural gas is also reflected in cost of sales, thus having little impact on margin. Income increased $4.7 million in 2001 due to increased sales and improved operations. WPS Energy Services Margins WPS Energy Services Gas Results (Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Nonregulated natural gas revenues $1,406.3 $919.5 $288.0 Nonregulated natural gas cost of sales 1,390.4 908.2 283.4 Margin $ 15.9 $ 11.3 $ 4.6 Nonregulated gas revenues at WPS Energy Services increased $486.8 million, or 53%, primarily as the result of sales volume growth and higher natural gas prices in the first half of 2001. The nonregulated gas margin increased $4.6 million, or 41%, due to increased sales volumes and exiting from unprofitable market segments. WPS Energy Services Electric Results (Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Nonregulated electric revenues $165.0 $33.8 $3.4 Nonregulated electric cost of sales 150.3 29.4 3.2 Margin $ 14.7 $ 4.4 $ .2 Nonregulated electric revenues at WPS Energy Services increased $131.2 million, or 388%. The nonregulated electric margin increased $10.3 million, or 234%. Higher electric sales volumes in existing and newly entered retail electric markets, increased electric wholesale activities, as well as impacts from marketing energy from WPS Power Developments Sunbury plant, contributed to these increases. WPS Energy Services Other Expenses Other operating expenses at WPS Energy Services increased $8.5 million largely due to costs associated with business expansion and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts. Impact of Enron Although WPS Energy Services is an energy marketer, it has experienced little impact on day to day operations as a result of the bankruptcy of Enron Corporation, and is in a net payable position with Enron affiliates. WPS Energy Services has liquidated all open positions with the Enron affiliates and replaced them with other suppliers. The forward contracts with the Enron affiliates provided for payments representing the net liquidation value of the contracts at the time of liquidation, and this net liquidation amount is reflected on the balance sheet as a current accounts payable, contingent upon the outcome of Enrons bankruptcy proceedings. Management believes these liabilities are properly recorded. The Enron bankruptcy is expected to have an effect on other companies throughout the industry. As a result, WPS Energy Services is more closely monitoring its credit exposure with other trading partners. Overview of WPS Power Development Revenues at WPS Power Development increased $13.4 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher revenues at its Sunbury generation plant of $7.0 million and higher revenues from its steam operations of $7.1 million. WPS Power Developments income was $2.3 million in 2001 compared with $0.9 million in 2000. Additional tax credits of approximately $4 million from its synthetic fuel operation was the primary factor in WPS Power Developments increased income in 2001. WPS Power Developments Margin WPS Power Developments Production Results (Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Nonregulated other revenues $141.5 $128.1 $35.4 Nonregulated other cost of sales 110.2 94.8 18.6 Margin $ 31.3 $ 33.3 $16.8 WPS Power Development experienced a decrease of $2.0 million in its margin in 2001 from 2000. The primary factors in this decrease were a $2.8 million margin decrease at Sunbury due to higher fuel costs as a result of purchasing coal at current market prices and higher costs of replacement power during outages. WPS Power Development is attempting to recover a portion of the fuel cost increase through a lawsuit which it filed against a coal supplier for failure to deliver under the terms of a coal supply agreement. The Sunbury margin decrease was partially offset by higher margins at the Westwood generation plant, which was acquired in September of 2000. WPS Power Developments Other Expenses/Income Other operating expenses at WPS Power Development increased by $4.5 million in 2001 compared with 2000, primarily due to costs associated with operations at the Westwood plant, higher payroll expenses, and increased development costs for potential new projects. Other income increased $1.8 million, primarily from a portion of the gain that was recognized in the sale of a partial interest in WPS Power Developments synthetic fuel facility. Tax Credits WPS Power Development recorded synthetic fuel tax credits of $21.5 million in 2001, an increase of approximately $4 million over 2000. We used these credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal tax liability, and the remainder increased our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years. Approximately $10 million of tax credits where carried over from 2001, which brings the cumulative credits being carried forward to approximately $21 million. Alternative minimum tax credits can be used in future years to reduce our regular tax liability, subject to various limitations. Based on a review of all known facts and circumstances, management has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use these credits in the future to reduce our federal tax liability. Overview of Holding Company and Other Operations Holding Company and Other operations include the operations of WPS Resources and WPS Resources Capital as holding companies and the nonutility activities at Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. Holding Company and Other operations experienced income of $1.3 million in 2001 compared with a loss of $7.9 million in 2000. Other nonutility income at Wisconsin Public Service included a pre tax gain of $13.1 million on the sale of hydro lands in December of 2001. The sale of these hydro lands was the first significant transaction in our five to seven year asset management strategy to increase shareholder return from the sale, development, or use of certain real estate assets deemed to be no longer essential to operations. In addition, earnings on equity investments were higher in 2001 compared with 2000 primarily due to our investment in American Transmission Company. Interest expense increased due to additional short term borrowing at WPS Resources for working capital needs in the first half of 2001. 2000 Compared with 1999 WPS Resources Corporation Overview WPS Resources 2000 and 1999 results of operations are shown in the following chart: WPS Resources Results (Millions, except share amounts) 2000 1999 Change Consolidated operating revenues $1,949.0 $1,098.5 77% Income available for common shareholders 67.0 59.6 12% Basic and diluted earnings per share $2.53 $2.24 13% The substantial revenue growth was largely due to increased natural gas and electric sales at WPS Energy Services and increased sales at WPS Power Development as we acquired additional customers and expanded into new markets. Part of the increase in revenues was a result of the record high unit cost of natural gas experienced in 2000. Gas cost per therm was 43% higher in 2000 than in 1999. The high unit cost of natural gas was reflected in both revenues and cost of sales, thus having little impact on margin. The increase in income and earnings per share was the result of higher electric and natural gas utility margins and increases in WPS Energy Services electric and natural gas margins. Additionally, a higher margin along with additional tax credits at WPS Power Development contributed to higher income. Partially offsetting these factors were increases in operating and interest expenses, coupled with costs associated with an electric energy contract entered into by WPS Resources as a hedge against potential summer energy price spikes. Overview of Utility Operations Income from electric utility operations was $60.7 million in 2000 compared with $56.1 million in 1999. Income from natural gas utility operations was $11.6 million in 2000 and $11.2 million in 1999. The primary reasons for higher utility net income were a Wisconsin retail electric rate increase and increased natural gas sales volumes as the result of winter weather that was 8% colder in 2000 than in 1999. Electric Utility Operations Our consolidated electric utility margin increased $29.7 million, or 8%, primarily due to a 4.6% Wisconsin retail electric rate increase at Wisconsin Public Service which became effective on January 1, 2000. This rate increase was primarily intended to recover additional fuel and purchased power costs for the year. The 2000 electric rate increase also took into account the expected gain on the sale of utility assets which is discussed under "Other Electric and Gas Utility Expenses/Income." Although our consolidated kilowatt hour sales were only slightly higher, partially due to a 31% cooler summer in 2000 than in 1999, consolidated revenues increased 7% due to the Wisconsin retail electric rate increase at Wisconsin Public Service. Our consolidated fuel expense increased $15.7 million, or 14%, due to increased production at Wisconsin Public Services fossil fueled and combustion turbine generation plants. In addition, the average cost of generation at the combustion turbine plants increased 90% largely as a result of a higher unit cost of natural gas. Generation costs at the Kewaunee plant decreased 14% in 2000 due to its scheduled outage for refueling and maintenance in the second quarter of 2000. A similar outage did not occur in 1999. The Kewaunee plant was off line beginning April 22, 2000 and returned to full power on June 2, 2000. During the scheduled outage, nuclear generation was replaced with additional fossil fuel and combustion turbine generation and additional purchased power. Wisconsin Public Service was the operator and 41.2% owner of the Kewaunee plant in 2000. Our consolidated purchased power expense decreased $4.1 million, however, largely due to a 5% decrease in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by Wisconsin Public Service in 2000 compared with 1999. Annual fuel costs at December 31, 2000 were within the 2% fuel window authorized by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and, accordingly, no adjustment was made to electric rates for 2000 fuel costs. Gas Utility Operations The gas utility margin at Wisconsin Public Service increased $5.4 million, or 7%, in 2000 due to an increase in throughput volumes. Winter weather was a factor for Wisconsin Public Services natural gas operations in 2000. Weather was 8% colder in 2000 than in 1999; however, weather was 2% warmer than normal in 2000. Wisconsin Public Services natural gas revenues increased $73.0 million, or 38%, as the result of a 43% increase in the average unit cost of natural gas coupled with a 6% increase in overall throughput volumes. Wisconsin Public Services natural gas purchase costs increased $67.6 million, or 57%. This increase resulted from a higher average unit cost of natural gas and higher gas volumes purchased of 10%. The higher unit cost of natural gas was reflected in both revenues and gas purchases, thus having little impact on margin. Other Electric and Gas Utility Expenses/Income Utility operating expenses increased $22.3 million. Electric utility operating expenses increased $18.4 million primarily due to costs associated with the scheduled outage and other maintenance activities at the Kewaunee plant. Higher earnings of $6.2 million on the Kewaunee plants nuclear decommissioning fund resulted in increased other income at Wisconsin Public Service in 2000. Due to regulatory practices, this higher income was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expense. Other income at Wisconsin Public Service also included a gain of $3.8 million on the sale of a combustion turbine which Wisconsin Public Service constructed for another Wisconsin utility. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin considered this gain in the Wisconsin retail electric rate adjustment which was effective January 1, 2000. Nonregulated Operations WPS Energy Services net income improved to $1.7 million in 2000 compared with a loss of $3.5 million in 1999. Income at WPS Power Development also improved. WPS Power Developments net income was $0.9 million in 2000 compared with a loss of $3.8 million in 1999. Overview of WPS Energy Services Revenues at WPS Energy Services grew to $955.6 million in 2000 compared with $292.2 million in 1999, an increase of 227%. This increase was the result of additional natural gas and electric sales volumes coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas. The higher unit cost of gas was also reflected in the cost of sales, thus having little impact on margin. Income increased $5.2 million in 2000 due to a larger increase in electric and gas margins than in the related other operating expenses. WPS Energy Services Margins The nonregulated gas margin at WPS Energy Services increased $6.7 million largely due to increased sales volumes. Natural gas revenues at WPS Energy Services more than tripled in 2000 compared with 1999. This increase was due to sales volumes that doubled as the result of additional sales in the wholesale market and general business growth. In addition, a large portion of the increase was due to a higher unit cost of natural gas in 2000. WPS Energy Services gas cost of sales tripled due to additional natural gas purchases coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas. Electric margins at WPS Energy Services increased $4.2 million in 2000. Electric revenues at WPS Energy Services were $33.8 million in 2000 and $3.4 million in 1999. This increase in revenue resulted from additional electric sales in Pennsylvania and Maine associated with WPS Power Developments assets that were acquired in the second and fourth quarters of 1999. Electric purchases increased $26.2 million due to additional sales volumes. WPS Energy Services Other Expenses Other operating expenses at WPS Energy Services increased $4.2 million, or 42%, primarily due to greater payroll and other operational costs associated with business expansion. Overview of WPS Power Development Income at WPS Power Development was $0.9 million in 2000 compared with a loss of $3.8 million in 1999. The increase in income was primarily due to a higher margin on operating activities and additional tax credits. Partially offsetting these factors were higher operating and interest expenses. Tax credits at WPS Power Development increased approximately $16.7 million in 2000. We used these tax credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal income tax liability. Approximately $11 million of these tax credits were carried forward from 2000 to reduce our tax liability in subsequent years. A large portion of the tax credits at WPS Power Development relate to the operations of its synthetic fuel facilities. Production at the synthetic fuel facility was higher than anticipated in 2000, despite the physical relocation of the project from Alabama to Kentucky during 2000. The facility was taken out of operation in April 2000 to prepare for relocation, and WPS Power Development began operation of the facilities in the new location on September 1, 2000. In addition, WPS Power Development reversed $0.9 million of previously recorded losses in the first quarter of 2000 as a result of an equity contribution to its synthetic fuel project by the minority owner. Prior to this transaction, WPS Power Development had been recording 100% of the operating losses of this project because the minority owners equity had been reduced to zero; however, it had been allocated only 66.7% of the tax credits. Through an agreement with the minority owner, WPS Power Development received 100% of the tax credits and operating results from the project until the minority owner was able to contribute further capital to fund its share of the operating costs. WPS Power Developments Margin WPS Power Development experienced an increase of $16.5 million in its margin in 2000. This increase was largely due to the operation of the electric generation facilities acquired in Maine and Canada in the second quarter of 1999 and in Pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of 1999. WPS Power Developments Other Expenses Other operating expenses at WPS Power Development increased $27.2 million in 2000 due to maintenance and higher production costs at its generation plants in Pennsylvania. Costs associated with the investigation and start up of new projects at WPS Power Development also increased in 2000. Higher interest expense of $6.3 million in 2000 was largely due to nonrecourse debt put in place to finance the plant acquisitions. Additional costs at the Sunbury generation plant in Pennsylvania lowered results at WPS Power Development, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2000. This included higher production costs, higher maintenance costs (both planned and accelerated) and increased costs of replacement power while the plant was undergoing maintenance. The decision was made to move some maintenance scheduled in future years into 2000 to coincide with other plant downtime. The accelerated maintenance at the Sunbury plant was intended to enhance availability in 2001 and future years. Overview of Holding Company and Other Operations Holding Company and Other Operations experienced a loss of $7.9 million in 2000 compared with a loss of $0.4 million in 1999. The increased loss was primarily due to additional interest expense, increased operating expenses, and a cost of $3.8 million for an electric energy contract entered into by WPS Resources in 2000 as a hedge against potential summer energy price spikes. BALANCE SHEET WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION 2001 Compared With 2000 Customer and other receivables decreased $69.8 million and accrued unbilled revenues decreased $27.4 million as the result of milder weather and a substantially lower unit cost of natural gas experienced in December of 2001 compared with December of 2000. Regulatory assets increased $16.5 million as the result of deferred costs related to compliance with certain Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements and additional regulatory assets acquired as a result of the Wisconsin Fuel and Light merger, largely related to future environmental remediation costs. Other assets increased $104.7 million largely as a result of the investment in American Transmission Company, goodwill associated with the Wisconsin Fuel and Light merger, and an increase in pension assets. Assets from risk management activities decreased $155.1 million and liabilities from risk management activities decreased $219.6 million largely due to changes in forward prices. Short term debt decreased $83.4 million as the result of replacing short term debt with additional long term debt at Wisconsin Public Service and common stock equity at WPS Resources. The current portion of long term debt includes $50.0 million of 7.30% first mortgage bonds at Wisconsin Public Service which mature on October 1, 2002. We currently have no plans to refinance these bonds with long term debt. Long term debt increased $67.8 million as the result of additional senior notes issued at Wisconsin Public Service in the third quarter of 2001 and obtaining financing through tax exempt bonds for WPS Power Developments Westwood plant in the second quarter of 2001. Regulatory liabilities increased $27.8 million primarily due to the deferral of $11.8 million in pension settlement gains resulting from employees transferring from Wisconsin Public Service to Nuclear Management Company, LLC. Other long term liabilities increased $47.9 million primarily due to the deferred gain of $38.0 million on the sale of a portion of WPS Power Developments ownership interest in its synthetic fuel operation. FINANCIAL CONDITION WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION Investments and Financing Payments for return of capital of $35.0 million were paid by Wisconsin Public Service to WPS Resources in 2001. WPS Resources made equity contributions of $95.0 million to Wisconsin Public Service in 2001. These payments and equity contributions allowed Wisconsin Public Services average equity capitalization and its capitalization ratio for ratemaking to remain near target levels as established by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in its most recent rate order. WPS Resources also contributed $54.8 million of equity to Wisconsin Public Service for the Wisconsin Fuel and Light acquisition. WPS Resources also made equity contributions of $12.0 million to Upper Peninsula Power Company in 2001. These equity contributions were made to maintain appropriate average common equity ratios. WPS Resources and WPS Power Development made equity contributions of $15.5 million and $9.0 million, respectively, to Sunbury Generation, LLC for expenditures at the Sunbury generation plant. Cash requirements exceeded internally generated funds by $112.8 million in 2001. Short term borrowings through commercial paper decreased $104.6 million as the result of issuing additional long term debt at Wisconsin Public Service and the sale of common stock at WPS Resources in 2001. Our pretax interest coverage, including nonrecourse debt, was 2.33 times for the 12 months ended December 31, 2001. In October 1999, WPS Resources filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which allowed the issuance of $400.0 million in the aggregate of public long term debt and common stock. Long term debt of $150.0 million was issued in 2000 and common stock of $79.0 million was issued in 2001 under the shelf registration. Effective January 2001, we began issuing new shares of common stock for our Stock Investment Plan and for certain of our stock based employee benefit plans. Equity increased by $18.6 million in 2001 as a result of these plans. WPS Resources also repurchased $1.1 million of existing common stock for stock based compensation plans. Wisconsin Public Service issued $150.0 million of 6.125% senior notes in the third quarter of 2001, with part of the proceeds used to retire $53.1 million of 8.8% first mortgage bonds. The remainder of the proceeds was used to reduce short term debt and support working capital requirements. The senior notes are secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds but become unsecured if Wisconsin Public Service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds. WPS Resources sold $79.0 million of common stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulting in a net increase in common equity of $76.0 million after issuance costs. In April 2001, the Schuylkill County Industrial Development Authority issued $27.0 million of refunding tax exempt bonds. WPS Westwood Generation is obligated to repay the refunding bonds. WPS Resources agreed to guaranty WPS Westwood Generations obligation to provide sufficient funds to pay the refunding bonds and the related obligations and indemnities. Wisconsin Public Service makes large investments in capital assets. Net construction expenditures, including nuclear fuel, for Wisconsin Public Service are expected to be approximately $565 million in the aggregate for the 2002 through 2004 period. Larger projects include $60 million for automated meter reading, $27 million for computer software and systems, and $68 million for the start of construction of generation facilities that will continue to be constructed through 2007. Other capital requirements for Wisconsin Public Service for the three year period include contributions of $7.8 million to the Kewaunee plants decommissioning trust fund. In 2004, the second phase of Wisconsin Public Services agreement to purchase electricity from the De Pere Energy Center, a gas fired cogeneration facility, will be accounted for as a capital lease. The De Pere Energy Center lease will be capitalized at approximately $80 million. Upper Peninsula Power is expected to incur net construction expenditures of about $37 million in the aggregate for the period 2002 through 2004, primarily for electric distribution improvements and repairs at hydro facilities. In addition, Upper Peninsula Power is considering the potential need for construction of a combustion turbine at an estimated cost of $41 million during the 2002 through 2003 timeframe. Identified capital expenditures for WPS Power Development for 2002 2004 include the acquisition of the CH Resources generating facilities for approximately $62 million in 2002, $13 million for handling NOx emissions at the Sunbury facility, and $4.7 million for generation facilities at the Combined Locks Energy Center. Other capital expenditures for WPS Power Development for 2002 2004 could be significant depending on its success in pursuing development and acquisition opportunities. When applicable, non recourse financing will be sought for funding significant portions of these acquisitions. WPS Resources expects to make capital contributions of up to $92 million to fund construction of our portion of the Wausau to Duluth transmission line which will be transferred to American Transmission Company in exchange for an increase in our equity ownership in American Transmission Company. Regulatory On December 21, 2000, Wisconsin Public Service received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing a 5.4% increase in retail electric rates and a 1.5% increase in retail natural gas rates for 2001 and 2002. A 12.1% return on equity was approved. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2001. On April 12, 2001, Wisconsin Public Service filed an application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for additional rate relief in 2002. Wisconsin Public Service requested an $86.8 million, or 16.1%, increase in retail electric rates and a $13.5 million, or 4.5%, increase in retail natural gas rates for 2002. Wisconsin Public Service requested a 12.6% return on equity, with equity constituting 55% of the capital structure. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsins order, originally expected to be issued in January 2002, has now been delayed until April 2002. Wisconsin Public Service received an interim rate order on December 19, 2001 and implemented interim rates on January 1, 2002. The order authorized a $55.5 million, or 10.3%, retail electric rate increase and a $11.2 million, or 4.7% retail natural gas rate increase. Interim rates are based on a 12.1% return on equity, with equity constituting 55% of the capital structure, are subject to refund to the extent interim revenues exceed revenue authorized in the final rate order, and will be in effect until superseded by the final rate order establishing new rates. Wisconsin Public Service anticipates that it will not be required to refund revenues collected under the interim rates. Upper Peninsula Power intends to submit an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission for rate increases sometime in 2002 and anticipates new rates will be effective in 2003. Merger with Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company The merger of Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company into Wisconsin Public Service was completed on April 1, 2001. Wisconsin Fuel and Light shareholders received 1.73 shares of WPS Resources common stock for each share of Wisconsin Fuel and Lights common stock. A total of 1,763,943 shares were issued resulting in a purchase price of $54.8 million based on an average price of $31.0625, the prevailing price at the time of the merger announcement. Wisconsin Public Service used the purchase method of accounting and recorded $41.9 million of total premium associated with the purchase. Of that total, $36.1 million was recorded as goodwill and $5.8 million after tax was recorded as an acquisition adjustment included in plant. The acquisition adjustment is expected to be recovered in Wisconsin retail rates over the period 2003 2005 as approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. American Transmission Company, LLC In the first and second quarters of 2001, Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power transferred transmission assets at their net book value to American Transmission Company in exchange for cash and an approximate 15% ownership interest in American Transmission Company. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin initiated a generic docket to address the potential recovery of deferred 2000 and 2001 start up costs and increased transmission operating costs of American Transmission Company by the member Wisconsin utilities including Wisconsin Public Service. Completion of the docket is anticipated in the spring of 2002 and should identify the costs to be recovered and the method for recovery. Wisconsin Public Service began recovering some of these costs, as a result of its interim rate case order, which was implemented January 1, 2002. The interim recovery of these costs is subject to refund should the costs in the final generic docket be less than the costs included in the interim rates. American Transmission Company implemented new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tariffs, subject to refund, on January 1, 2001. Settlements related to issues surrounding these tariffs were approved in late 2001. The settlement reduced transmission rates for Wisconsin Public Service by approximately $8 million during the 2001 2005 phase in period. On August 17, 2001, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the construction of a 220 mile 345 kV transmission line from Wausau, Wisconsin to Duluth, Minnesota. The joint project of Wisconsin Public Service and Minnesota Power had received the approval of the Minnesota Public Service Commission in March of 2001. Construction of the line is expected to begin in 2002 with completion in 2005. Our funding obligation of the construction costs is estimated to be between $46 million and $92 million. Our interest in the line will eventually be contributed to American Transmission Company for an increased equity interest in American Transmission Company. We anticipate that our equity interest in American Transmission Company may increase to approximately 25% after completion and contribution of the line. Kewaunee Nuclear Plant On January 1, 2001, Wisconsin Public Services administrative employees at the Kewaunee plant transferred to Nuclear Management Company, LLC. As a result of these employees leaving the Wisconsin Public Service benefit plans, a curtailment loss of $8.8 million was experienced. Most of the curtailment loss was deferred as a regulatory asset. We recognized settlement gains of $12.8 million in 2001 as a result of these employees and other former employees taking withdrawals from the pension plan during the year. The majority of the settlement gains were recorded as a regulatory liability. Wisconsin Public Service will return the net of settlement gains and curtailment losses to ratepayers in future rates. The Kewaunee plants co owners received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to apply deferred accounting treatment beginning March 27, 2001 to the incremental costs associated with compliance with certain Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements mandating improvements to plant procedures. Wisconsin Public Service received an order to recover the deferred costs subject to review by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in a future rate proceeding. Wisconsin Public Service has deferred approximately $10 million as a regulatory asset through December 31, 2001. On September 24, 2001, Wisconsin Public Service acquired Madison Gas and Electrics 17.8% interest in the Kewaunee plant for $17.5 million. This acquisition increased Wisconsin Public Services ownership interest in the Kewaunee plant to 59%. Security On December 19, 2001, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized Wisconsin Public Service to defer additional costs incurred with regard to increased security measures at Kewaunee and other facilities. The deferred security costs will be addressed in Wisconsin Public Services rate proceeding to be filed in 2002 for 2003 rate relief. Wisconsin River Power Company Wisconsin Public Services ownership interest in Wisconsin River Power Company decreased to 50% effective December 31, 2001 as the result of the sale of a portion of its ownership interest to Wisconsin Power and Light Company. Acquisition of Generation Facilities On September 10, 2001, Mid American Power, LLC, a joint venture of WPS Power Development and Burns & McDonnell, announced a plan for construction of an additional 200 megawatts of electrical capacity at the existing 53 megawatt Stoneman power plant in Cassville, Wisconsin. Construction is expected to begin in 2003 with completion by the first quarter of 2006. We expect the Combined Locks Energy Center, a cogeneration project owned by WPS Power Development and located at the Appleton Coated paper mill in Combined Locks, Wisconsin, to begin full operation by May 1, 2002. WPS Energy Services will market the electric energy produced by the facility in the wholesale electric marketplace. Construction is underway to install a heat recovery steam generator which will complete the cogeneration aspect of the project. In December 2001, WPS Power Development reached an agreement to purchase the stock of CH Resources, Inc. which owns three power plants and other assets. The $62 million transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2002. WPS Resources is expected to issue short term debt in order to provide equity funding to WPS Power Development for this acquisition. ECO Coal Pelletization #12 LLC Operations In November 2001, WPS Power Development, through its subsidiary ECO Coal Pelletization #12 LLC, entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of a public company resulting in ECO #12 contributing its synthetic fuel producing machinery to a newly formed entity in exchange for cash and a one third ownership interest in the newly formed entity. The transaction generated a pre tax gain of $40.1 million of which $38.0 million has been deferred as of December 31, 2001 as a result of certain rights of rescission and written puts being granted to the buyer. As these rights of rescission expire and the amount of the put options granted to the buyer diminishes, WPS Power Development will recognize the deferred gain on the transaction. Concurrent with the partial sale of this project, WPS Power Development bought out the interest of its previous partner in the ECO #12 project. The actual payments to this former partner are contingent upon the same provisions referred to above. As a result, on December 31, 2001, $21.3 million was held in escrow, which will be released proportionally as the respective rescission rights and put options expire. Sunbury Generation, LLC WPS Power Development acquired the Sunbury generation plant in November of 1999. As a result of both market conditions and issues related to the physical performance of the plant, the project to date has not met managements projected near term financial performance levels. Due to this lower level of performance, WPS Resources and WPS Power Development contributed additional capital into the project to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures and to ensure that the project complies with its project financing debt covenants. In 2001, capital contributions amounted to $24.5 million. Projections going forward indicate that Sunbury will produce adequate cash flows for its operations, with capital contributions being required for capital expenditures. In 2002, capital contributions will be required primarily to fund a project to reduce NOx emissions from the plant. Those expenditures are estimated to be approximately $13 million and were anticipated when the plant was acquired. TRENDS WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Judgments and uncertainties about the application of these accounting policies along with estimates and other assumptions may affect reported results. We consolidate the financial statements of all majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and their financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating each utility. For Wisconsin Public Service, these include the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, 90% of revenues; the Michigan Public Service Commission, 2% of revenues; and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 8% of revenues. Although unlikely, should Wisconsin Public Service or Upper Peninsula Power no longer meet the criteria for applying Statement No. 71, we would discontinue its application as defined under Statement No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." Assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurs. We accrue estimated amounts for services rendered but not yet billed. We reserve an estimate for potential uncollectible customer accounts based on historical uncollectible experience and specific customer identification where practical. WPS Energy Services follows the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." WPS Energy Services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to its customers. WPS Energy Services also uses derivatives to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases as well as trading activities. Derivatives may include futures and forward contracts, price swap agreements, and call and put options. Accordingly under Issue No. 98 10, WPS Energy Services marks its energy trading contracts to fair value on the balance sheet, and recognizes changes in market value in earnings. Impact of New Accounting Standards We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," on January 1, 2001. This statement requires derivative instruments to be recorded at their fair value as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Changes in the derivatives fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We concluded that the majority of contracts at our utility subsidiaries and at WPS Power Development for the purchase, sale, and storage of natural gas, electricity, coal, and nuclear fuel do not meet the definition of a derivative as defined under Statement No. 133 and, therefore, are not subject to the accounting requirements of Statement No. 133. Wisconsin Public Service entered into a limited number of commodity contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. We believe that any gains or losses resulting from the settlement of these contracts will be collected from, or refunded to, retail customers. Derivative assets and liabilities that are recorded as a result of these derivative contracts are offset with corresponding regulatory assets and liabilities. At January 1, 2001, Wisconsin Public Service recorded a derivative asset and an offsetting regulatory liability of approximately $17 million. The cumulative effect on income was not significant. WPS Energy Services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold to customers at firm prices. WPS Energy Services also uses derivatives to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases as well as trading activities. WPS Energy Services concluded that its energy contracts were trading contracts and, therefore, applies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." Accordingly, WPS Energy Services recorded its energy contracts at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Because WPS Energy Services marks its energy trading contracts to market in accordance with Issue 98 10 and does not anticipate designating any derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, the adoption of Statement No. 133 did not have a material impact at WPS Energy Services. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on January 1, 2002. The financial statement impact of adapting Standard No. 142 was immaterial. In accordance with the requirements of this statement, we ceased amortizing the goodwill associated with the Wisconsin Fuel and Light merger at January 1, 2002, and prepared a preliminary evaluation of the fair market value of the gas utility business segment to assess the potential impairment of the goodwill balance. Based on the estimated fair value, an impairment charge was not required. Liquidity WPS Resources normally uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements. We may periodically issue long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. We seek non recourse financing for funding some nonregulated acquisitions. WPS Resources commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses and Upper Peninsula Power. The specific forms of financing, amounts, and timing depend on the availability of projects, market conditions, and other factors. The current credit ratings for WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys WPS Resources Corporation Senior unsecured debt Commercial paper Trust preferred securities A+ A 1 A Aa3 P 1 A1 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation Bonds Preferred stock Commercial paper AA A A 1+ Aa1 A1 P 1 These ratings are among the best in the energy industry and have allowed us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms. Rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a companys credit rating. These measures include business risk, liquidity risk, competitive position, capital mix, financial condition, predictability of cash flows, management strength, and future direction. Some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios, while the qualitative ones are more subjective. The recapture of its operating and capital costs through ratemaking mechanisms such as the electric fuel window, purchased gas adjustment clause, and frequent rate adjustments based on projected test years have a positive impact on Wisconsin Public Services liquidity. WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service maintain separate commercial paper borrowing programs in compliance with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsins directives. Factors affecting the commercial paper credit ratings at both WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service include the overall credit strength for the company, the ratings on its long term debt, the amount of its short term debt, and the amount and quality of the bank facilities backing up its commercial paper borrowing. If the companys long term debt rating were to fall below a rating of A+/A 1, the potential exists for a downgrade in its commercial paper rating. WPS Resources holds credit lines to back 100% of its commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit. Included in the credit lines of WPS Resources, and also of Wisconsin Public Service, are credit lines of $10 million and $15 million, respectively, that require both companies to maintain a commercial paper rating of A 1/P 1. A decrease in ratings below that level could adversely affect the company by increasing the interest rates at which it can borrow, restricting its ability to obtain lines and letters of credit, and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the company in the commercial paper market. A restriction in the companys ability to use commercial paper borrowing for its working capital needs could require it to secure funds through bank loans resulting in higher interest expense and delayed availability of funds. WPS Energy Services maintains underlying agreements to support its electric and gas trading operations. In the event of a deterioration of WPS Resources credit rating, most of these agreements allow the counter party to demand additional assurance of payment. This provision could pertain to existing business, new business, or both with the counter party. The additional assurance requirements could be met with letters of credit, surety bonds, or cash deposits and would likely result in WPS Resources being required to maintain increased bank lines of credit, incur additional expenses, and could restrict the amount of business WPS Energy Services can conduct. WPS Energy Services uses the NYMEX and over the counter financial markets to hedge its exposure to physical customer obligations. These hedges are closely correlated to the customer contracts, but price movements on the hedge contracts may require financial backing. Certain movements in price for contracts through the NYMEX exchange require posting of cash deposits equal to the market move. For the over the counter market, the underlying contract may allow the counter party to require additional collateral to cover the increased obligation. Market price changes could cause significant near term cash requirements to support the business. Increased requirements related to market price changes should only result in a temporary liquidity need that will unwind as the sales contracts are fulfilled. WPS Power Development has some projects which are partially funded by non recourse debt. These debt obligations have certain debt coverage covenants related to liquidity that must be met. Factors that can impact liquidity at these projects are overall electric market conditions, the physical availability of the project to meet contractual requirements, the cost and availability of required inputs to production, and the level of operating and maintenance costs. If any of these projects should fall below the required debt coverage levels, WPS Resources can either contribute additional equity or, if market conditions are such that the project is no longer considered viable, abandon the project. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables summarize the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of WPS Resources, including its subsidiaries. Payments due by period Contractual Obligations (Millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt principal and interest payments $1,173.2 $102.7 $230.3 $ 86.9 $753.3 Minimum capital lease obligations 124.7 5.2 16.9 12.3 90.3 Operating leases 4.9 2.7 1.9 0.2 0.1 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,228.2 694.9 444.3 28.2 60.8 Total contractual cash obligations $2,531.0 $805.5 $693.4 $127.6 $904.5 Long term debt principal and interest payments represent bonds, notes, and loans held by WPS Resources and its subsidiaries. We record all principal obligations on the balance sheet. Wisconsin Public Service records minimum capital lease obligations on its balance sheet at net present value. The above table represents the total future obligation. Unconditional purchase obligations represent energy supply contracts at WPS Energy Services and certain commodity purchase contracts at Wisconsin Public Service and WPS Power Development. The energy supply contracts at WPS Energy Services have offsetting energy sale contracts. Wisconsin Public Service expects to recover the costs of its contracts in future customer rates. Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments (Millions) Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years Over 5 years Lines of credit $133.3 $60.0 $73.3 $ $ Standby letters of credit 18.4 18.3 0.1 Guaranties 4.5 4.5 Total commercial commitments $156.2 $82.8 $73.4 $ $ The WPS Resources Board of Directors has authorized management to issue corporate guaranties in the aggregate amount of up to $500 million to support the business operations of WPS Energy Services which are not reflected in the table above. WPS Resources primarily issues the guaranties to counter parties in the wholesale electric and natural gas marketplace to meet the counter parties requirements and permit WPS Energy Services to operate within these markets. The authorized amount of the guaranties is in excess of the amount of obligations actually backed by the WPS Resources guaranties. The amount supported is dependent on the amount of outstanding business WPS Energy Services has with the counter parties holding the guaranties at any point in time. WPS Resources reflects WPS Energy Services obligations supported by these parental guaranties on its consolidated balance sheet either as accounts payable or liabilities from risk management activities. The WPS Resources Board of Directors has authorized corporate guaranties as needed to support certain specific business operations of WPS Power Development. WPS Resources has issued approximately $130 million in guaranties which are not reflected in the table above. WPS Resources issues the guaranties for indemnification obligations related to business purchase agreements, borrowings, and counter parties in the wholesale electric marketplace to meet their credit requirements and permit WPS Power Development to operate within these markets. The authorized amount of the guaranties is in excess of the amount of obligations actually backed by WPS Resources guaranties. The amount supported is dependent on the amount of the outstanding obligation that WPS Power Development has with the parties holding the guaranties at any point in time. The guaranties are required to support WPS Power Development in its normal operations of energy production and the sale of electricity. WPS Resources reflects WPS Power Developments obligations supported by these parental guaranties on its consolidated balance sheets or in the footnotes to its financial statements. Since May 2000, WPS Resources has provided limited financial support and energy supply services to a third party, Quest Energy, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company. Quest is a retail electricity marketing entity, doing business as a registered Alternative Electric Supplier in the state of Michigan. Financial support is in the form of an interest bearing note with an initial maturity date of May 2005, secured by the assets of Quest. On December 31, 2001, the loan amount remaining was $1.0 million. The note contains certain restrictions on Quests ability to enter into additional debt instruments. WPS Resources also provides corporate guaranties on behalf of Quest that are not included in its consolidated financial statements. Guaranties have been made to Quests transmission providers in the amount of $4.5 million. These guaranties assure Quests ability to pay for the transmission services it purchases from these entities. These guaranties are reflected in the table above. WPS Energy Services provides substantially all of the electric energy supply to Quest on a wholesale basis without requiring the credit assurances required of other wholesale customers. WPS Energy Services exercises its right to evaluate Quests sales portfolio to verify the portfolios ability to generate the revenues necessary to pay for purchased wholesale supply. WPS Energy Services further provides computational infrastructure and support services related to the daily operational activities of Quest. At year end, Quest was current in its payables to WPS Energy Services. On occasion, however, payments from Quest have been late and WPS Energy Services imposes payment penalties on these late payments. Trading Activities WPS Energy Services measures the fair value of contracts, including NYMEX exchange and over the counter contracts, natural gas options, natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts, basis contracts, and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis using risk management systems. The primary input for natural gas pricing is the settled forward price curve of the NYMEX exchange which includes spreads, contracts, and options. Basis pricing is derived from published indices (Gas Daily, Natural Gas Intelligence, and Inside FERC) and well documented broker quotes. WPS Energy Services bases electric prices on published indices and well documented broker quotes. Because the majority of the contracts have a term of less than 36 months, the forward curves have a reasonable degree of liquidity and WPS Energy Services does not determine any forward price curves internally. Low tolerance for price risk causes WPS Energy Services to use financial instruments to hedge substantially all its positions and, therefore, changes in the primary variable, which is the forward price curves, has little impact on the net fair value of the contracts as marked to market. An outside company with an established practice in energy risk evaluation verified the electric mark to market position at December 31, 2001 due to the large increase in new business and the introduction of new electric risk management software. The results of its independent calculation were consistent with those generated by WPS Energy Services. WPS Energy Services, Inc. Mark to Market Roll Forward (Millions) Natural Gas Electric Total Fair value of contracts January 1, 2001 $ 7.3 $0.3 $ 7.6 Less contracts realized or settled during period 2.2 0.3 2.5 Plus fair value of new contracts entered into during period and other changes in fair value 8.7 6.3 15.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001 $13.8 $6.3 $20.1 The fair value of contracts at January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2001, reflect the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market assets as of those dates. Contracts realized or settled include the value of contracts in existence at January 1, 2001 that were no longer in the net mark to market assets as of December 31, 2001. Mark to market gains and losses related to contracts that are still included in WPS Energy Services portfolio at December 31, 2001, are included in the fair value of new contracts entered into during the period. These amounts represent the mark to market gain or loss at the inception of these contracts. There were, in many cases, offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current year. The gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above. Although WPS Energy Services strives to maintain a balanced book of back to back transactions, due to systems limitations, any ineffectiveness in hedging activity for 2001 has been included under "fair value of new contracts entered into during period" in the table above. WPS Energy Services, Inc. Contract Aging at Fair Value Source of Fair Value (Millions) Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1 3 years Maturity 4 5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total fair value Prices actively quoted $12.0 $(0.8) $11.2 Prices provided by external sources 0.2 (0.1) 0.1 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 3.0 4.5 1.3 8.8 Total fair value $15.2 $ 3.6 $1.3 $20.1 Prices actively quoted includes NYMEX and over the counter contracts.

Prices based on models and other valuation methods include retail natural gas and electric contracts due to the volume optionality that exists in those contracts. We derive from active quotes, or external sources provide, pricing, the most significant variable in the mark to market calculation, for all contracts in the above table. Related Party Transactions We do not have material related party transactions nor other relationships which would allow us to negotiate terms of material transactions on less than an arms length basis. Electric Utility Restructuring Wisconsin Electric reliability continues to be the primary issue for the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Industry restructuring and retail generation open access remain secondary issues in the state. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin is evaluating proposals regarding future construction and ownership of generation facilities in the state. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized Wisconsin Electric Power Company to proceed with its planning for generation construction. On February 1, 2002, Wisconsin Electric Power applied for Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity for its generation construction proposals. This application is being reviewed, however, and further approval is required in order for Wisconsin Electric Power to proceed. Electric Utility Restructuring Michigan In June 2000, a law was enacted which provides Michigan retail electric customers the right to choose their generation supplier by January 1, 2002. Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power, along with other Michigan Electric and Gas Association members, jointly developed and filed open access tariffs and business practices with the Michigan Public Service Commission prior to January 1, 2002. Gas Utility Restructuring Wisconsin In its 2001 2002 Wisconsin retail rate application, Wisconsin Public Service proposed to facilitate customer choice of natural gas suppliers through the use of its new automated meter reading system. The proposal was approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and provided customer choice of gas suppliers for large commercial customers beginning on November 1, 2001. Customer choice will be offered to additional commercial customers beginning on November 1, 2002. This program will be expanded to all customers as the automated meter reading system is installed system wide. Gas Utility Restructuring Michigan Most of Michigans largest gas customers are allowed to choose their natural gas commodity supplier. The smaller Michigan natural gas utilities, including Wisconsin Public Service, are to propose a customer choice program for all customer classes when it is in the best interests of each utility and its customers. Wisconsin Public Service intends to provide customer choice to its Michigan customers following the implementation of its automated meter reading system in that state. Environmental Wisconsin Public Service estimates future undiscounted investigation and cleanup costs of 10 former manufactured gas sites to be in the range of $43 million to $50 million. We may adjust these estimates in the future contingent upon remedial technology, regulatory requirements, and the assessment of environmental damages. Wisconsin Public Service currently has a $43.4 million liability recorded for gas plant cleanup with an offsetting regulatory asset (deferred charge). We expect to recover cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries in future customer rates. We will not recover carrying costs associated with the cleanup expenditures. Wisconsin Public Service has received $12.7 million in insurance recoveries which have been recorded as a reduction in the regulatory asset. The state of Wisconsin developed a nitrogen oxide reduction plan for all utilities in the ozone non attainment area established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in southern Wisconsin. The nitrogen oxide reductions begin in 2003, and the requirements are gradually increased through 2007. This reduction plan affects Edgewater Unit 4. Wisconsin Public Service owns 31.8% of this unit. A compliance plan for Edgewater Unit 4 was initiated in 2000. The plan includes a combination of combustion optimization and emission trading at a potential cost to Wisconsin Public Service of approximately $5 million. The State of Wisconsin is also seeking voluntary reductions from units outside the ozone non attainment area which may lead to additional expenditures for nitrogen oxide reductions at other units. Wisconsin Public Service is participating in voluntary efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide levels at the Columbia Energy Center. Wisconsin Public Service owns 31.8% of Columbia. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has approved recovery of the costs associated with nitrogen oxide compliance. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources initiated a rulemaking effort aimed at the control of mercury emissions. Coal fired generation plants are the primary target of this effort. The proposed rule was open to comment in October 2001. A final rule could be issued in the spring of 2002. As proposed, the rule requires phased in mercury emission reductions reaching 90% reduction in 15 years. Wisconsin Public Service estimates that it could cost $105 million per year for it to achieve the 90% reduction. Early compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act has generated surplus sulfur dioxide allowances at Wisconsin Public Service. Wisconsin Public Service has sold and will continue to consider the sale of any allowances in excess of its own needs. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has ordered that profits from the sale of allowances be passed on to Wisconsin Public Services customers. WPS Power Development acquired emission allowances as a result of the purchase of the Sunbury plant in 1999 and the Westwood plant in 2000. The costs assigned to these allowances are charged to expense as the allowances are used. The Sunbury plant also purchases incremental emission allowances on the open market to comply with air regulations. WPS Power Development is installing additional technology in order to comply with the 2003 nitrogen oxide standards. Expenditures for this technology could be significant. Asset Management Strategy In December 2001 Wisconsin Public Service sold 5,740 acres of land on the Peshtigo River in northeastern Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for $13.5 million. This sale was the first significant transaction in a five to seven year asset management strategy we adopted in 2001. The agreement with the Department of Natural Resources includes two options, one exercisable in 2003 and the other in 2004, whereby the Department may acquire, at less than fair value, approximately 5,000 additional acres for $11.5 million if both options are exercised. The value associated with the difference between the option price and the fair value will be treated as a charitable contribution. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and report operating results in terms of historic cost. The statements provide a reasonable, objective, and quantifiable statement of financial results; but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation. Under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions, Wisconsin Public Services and Upper Peninsula Powers projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues. Because rate forecasting assumes inflation, most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates. However, in these forecasts, Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION Wisconsin Public Service Corporation is a regulated electric and natural gas utility. Electric operations accounted for approximately 66% of 2001 revenues, while gas operations contributed 34% to 2001 revenues. 2001 Compared with 2000 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation Overview Wisconsin Public Services 2001 and 2000 results of operations are shown in the following chart: Wisconsin Public Services Results (Millions) 2001 2000 Change Operating revenues $932.3 $840.5 11% Earnings on common stock 80.6 70.4 14% Sales volume growth, rate increases, and higher natural gas prices in the first part of 2001 contributed to increased revenues. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized a 5.4% increase in Wisconsin retail electric rates and a 1.5% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective January 1, 2001. Earnings from electric utility operations were $57.8 million in 2001 compared with $58.2 million in 2000. Earnings from gas utility operations were $5.9 million in 2001 and $11.6 million in 2000. Other nonutility income from the gain on the sale of hydro lands as part of our asset management strategy and increased utility margins contributed to higher overall earnings. Partially offsetting these factors were increased operating expenses. Electric Utility Operations Wisconsin Public Services electric utility margin increased $13.0 million, or 3%, primarily due to a 5.4% Wisconsin retail electric rate increase which became effective on January 1, 2001. Electric Utility Results (Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $610.7 $576.0 $527.9 Fuel and purchased power 212.8 191.1 170.6 Margin $397.9 $384.9 $357.3 Sales in kilowatt hours 12,618,877 12,406,917 11,920,148 Wisconsin Public Services electric utility margin increased due to the electric rate increase and higher sales volumes to most customer classes at Wisconsin Public Service. Summer weather was 66% warmer in 2001 than in 2000, and 17% warmer than normal. Partially offsetting these factors was a 2% decrease in sales to large commercial and industrial customers due to declining economic conditions. Also affecting the electric utility margin was a change in the customer mix. Sales to lower margin, non firm customers increased more than sales to higher margin customers. Wisconsin Public Services fuel expense for production plants decreased $5.7 million, or 4%, largely due to decreased production at its combustion turbine generation plants. Wisconsin Public Services purchased power expense, however, increased $27.4 million due to an increase in power purchases and a 19% increase in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made in 2001 compared with 2000. Power purchases were 21% higher in 2001 due to warmer summer weather and the availability of economically priced energy. Also contributing to increased power purchases were a scheduled outage at Wisconsin Public Services nuclear plant and an unscheduled outage at one of its fossil fueled generation plants. Wisconsin Public Services Kewaunee plant was off line for a scheduled refueling and replacement of its steam generators in late September of 2001. The Kewaunee plant returned to service in early December as scheduled. Wisconsin Public Service is currently a 59% owner of the Kewaunee plant. Wisconsin Public Services Pulliam Unit 7 was off line for unscheduled repairs in the fourth quarter of 2001 and returned to service on February 3, 2002. Wisconsin Public Service chose to take advantage of purchased power during these outages because of economically favorable pricing. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows Wisconsin Public Service the opportunity to adjust prospectively the amount billed to Wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range. Wisconsin Public Service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus 2% from forecasted costs on an annualized basis. In the third quarter of 2001, Wisconsin Public Service submitted a fuel filing with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin requesting a $1.9 million retail electric rate reduction. The rate reduction was approved and implemented on September 3, 2001. Wisconsin Public Service submitted an additional fuel filing in November 2001, and a rate reduction of $0.3 million was approved and implemented on December 8, 2001. Gas Utility Operations Effective April 1, 2001, the gas utility margin at Wisconsin Public Service includes the merged Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company operations. Wisconsin Public Service Corporations Gas Utility Results (Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $321.6 $264.5 $191.5 Purchase costs 230.2 185.1 117.6 Margin $ 91.4 $ 79.4 $ 73.9 Throughput in therms 742,722 701,094 662,615 The gas utility margin at Wisconsin Public Service increased $12.0 million, or 15%, in 2001. This increase was due to a 1.5% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates effective January 1, 2001, and higher overall natural gas throughput volumes of 6%. Increased gas throughput volumes were largely the result of Wisconsin Public Services acquisition of Wisconsin Fuel and Light in the second quarter of 2001. Gas throughput volumes to large commercial and industrial customers, however, decreased 9% as a result of customers switching to the gas transport customer class and declining economic conditions. Gas throughput volumes to gas transport customers increased 15%. In addition, gas throughput volumes to interruptible customers decreased 6%. Gas throughput volumes were negatively affected by winter weather which was 9% milder in 2001 than in 2000, and 8% milder than normal. Wisconsin Public Services natural gas revenues increased $57.1 million, or 22%, as the result of an increase in the average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of 2001, increased throughput, and the 1.5% increase in Wisconsin retail gas rates. Wisconsin Public Services natural gas purchase costs increased $45.1 million, or 24%, largely due to a higher average unit cost of natural gas in the first half of 2001. The higher natural gas prices experienced earlier in 2001 were passed on to customers and are reflected in both revenues and gas purchases, thus having little impact on margin. Under current regulatory practice, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Michigan Public Service Commission allow Wisconsin Public Service to pass changes in the cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause. Other Utility Expenses/Income Utility operating expenses increased $36.3 million largely due to increased transmission expenses associated with the transfer of assets to American Transmission Company, increased payments to the Wisconsin Department of Administration for demand side management (energy conservation) activities, increased maintenance costs at the Kewaunee plant during its refueling outage, and higher write offs of uncollectible accounts. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has allowed a portion of the higher transmission costs to be deferred. The deferred transmission costs, $4.4 million for 2001, are expected to be recovered in future regulatory proceedings. Lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund contributed to a decrease in other income from utility operations. Due to regulatory practice, lower earnings on the nuclear decommissioning fund were offset by decreased depreciation expense. Also contributing to decreased depreciation expense were an extension in the Kewaunee plants assumed depreciable life and a reduction in the nuclear decommissioning fund contribution. Interest expense increased due to the issuance of additional long term debt by Wisconsin Public Service in August of 2001. Other Nonutility Income Other nonutility income at Wisconsin Public Service included a pre tax gain of $13.1 million on the sale of hydro lands in December of 2001. The sale of these hydro lands was the first significant transaction in our five to seven year asset management strategy to increase shareholder return from the sale, development, or use of certain real estate assets deemed to be no longer essential to operations. In addition, earnings on equity investments were higher in 2001 compared with 2000 primarily due to our investment in American Transmission Company. 2000 Compared with 1999 Overview Wisconsin Public Services 2000 and 1999 results of operations are shown in the following chart: Wisconsin Public Services Results (Millions) 2000 1999 Change Operating revenues $840.5 $719.4 17% Earnings on common stock 70.4 67.1 5% Earnings from electric utility operations were $58.2 million in 2000 compared with $54.1 million in 1999. Earnings from natural gas utility operations were $11.6 million in 2000 and $11.2 million in 1999. The primary reasons for higher utility earnings were a Wisconsin retail electric rate increase and increased natural gas sales volumes as the result of winter weather that was 8% colder in 2000 than in 1999. Electric Utility Operations Wisconsin Public Services electric utility margin increased $27.6 million, or 8%, primarily due to a 4.6% Wisconsin retail electric rate increase which became effective on January 1, 2000. This rate increase was primarily intended to recover additional fuel and purchased power costs for the year. The 2000 electric rate increase also took into account the expected gain on the sale of utility assets which is discussed under "Other Electric and Gas Utility Expenses/Income." Electric utility revenues increased $48.1 million, or 9%, due to a 4% increase in overall sales volume coupled with the Wisconsin retail electric rate increase. Sales volumes increased in spite of summer weather that was 31% cooler in 2000 than in 1999. Fuel expense increased $15.3 million, or 14%, due to increased production at Wisconsin Public Services fossil fueled and combustion turbine generation plants. In addition, the average cost of generation at the combustion turbine plants increased 90% largely as a result of a higher unit cost of natural gas. Generation costs at the Kewaunee plant decreased 14% in 2000 due to its scheduled outage for refueling and maintenance in the second quarter of 2000. A similar outage did not occur in 1999. The Kewaunee plant was off line beginning April 22, 2000 and returned to full power on June 2, 2000. During the scheduled outage, nuclear generation was replaced with additional fossil fuel and combustion turbine generation and additional purchased power. Wisconsin Public Service was the operator and 41.2% owner of the Kewaunee plant in 2000 and 1999. Purchased power expense decreased $5.2 million, however, largely due to a 5% decrease in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by Wisconsin Public Service in 2000 compared with 1999. Annual fuel costs at December 31, 2000 were within the 2% fuel window authorized by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and, accordingly, no adjustment was made to electric rates for 2000 fuel costs. Gas Utility Operations Wisconsin Public Services gas utility margin increased $5.4 million, or 7%, in 2000. This increase was primarily due to an increase in throughput volumes. Winter weather was a factor for natural gas operations in 2000. Weather was 8% colder in 2000 than in 1999; however, weather was 2% warmer than normal in 2000. Natural gas revenues increased $73.0 million, or 38%, as the result of a 43% increase in the average unit cost of natural gas coupled with a 6% increase in overall throughput volumes. Natural gas purchase costs increased $67.5 million, or 57%. This increase resulted from a higher average unit cost of natural gas and higher gas volumes purchased of 10%. The higher unit cost of natural gas is reflected in both revenues and gas purchases, thus having little impact on margin. Other Electric and Gas Utility Expenses/Income Utility operation and maintenance expenses increased $20.6 million. Electric utility operation and maintenance expenses increased $16.6 million primarily due to costs associated with the scheduled outage and other maintenance activities at the Kewaunee plant. Higher earnings of $6.2 million on the Kewaunee plants nuclear decommissioning fund resulted in increased other income in 2000. Due to regulatory practices, this higher income was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expense. Other income also included a gain of $3.8 million on the sale of a combustion turbine which Wisconsin Public Service constructed for another Wisconsin utility. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin considered this gain in the Wisconsin retail electric rate adjustment which was effective January 1, 2000. BALANCE SHEET WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE 2001 Compared with 2000 Regulatory assets increased $16.6 million as the result of deferred costs related to compliance with certain Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements and additional regulatory assets acquired as a result of the Wisconsin Fuel and Light merger, largely related to future environmental remediation costs. The goodwill balance of $35.4 million relates to Wisconsin Public Services acquisition of Wisconsin Fuel and Light in 2001. Investments and other assets increased $56.2 million largely as a result of Wisconsin Public Services ownership interest in American Transmission Company. Commercial paper decreased $60.0 million as the result of replacing short term debt with additional long term debt at Wisconsin Public Service. The current portion of long term debt includes $50.0 million of 7.30% first mortgage bonds which mature on October 1, 2002. We currently have no plans to refinance these bonds with long term debt. Long term debt increased $46.8 million as the result of additional senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2001. Regulatory liabilities increased $28.0 million primarily due to the deferral of $11.8 million in pension settlement gains resulting from employees transferring from Wisconsin Public Service to Nuclear Management Company, LLC. FINANCIAL CONDITION WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE Payments for return of capital of $35.0 million were paid by Wisconsin Public Service to WPS Resources in 2001. WPS Resources made equity contributions of $95.0 million to Wisconsin Public Service in 2001. These payments and equity contributions allowed Wisconsin Public Services average equity capitalization and its capitalization ratio for ratemaking to remain near target levels as established by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in its most recent rate order. WPS Resources also contributed $54.8 million of equity to Wisconsin Public Service for the Wisconsin Fuel and Light acquisition. Cash requirements exceeded internally generated funds by $17.9 million in 2001. Short term borrowings through commercial paper decreased $60.0 million as the result of issuing additional long term debt at Wisconsin Public Service in the third quarter of 2001. Pretax interest coverage was 4.64 times for the 12 months ended December 31, 2001. Standard & Poors has recently reviewed the credit ratings of many of the Wisconsin utilities. The current credit ratings for Wisconsin Public Service are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys Wisconsin Public Service Corporation Bonds Preferred stock Commercial paper AA A A 1+ Aa1 A1 P 1 We normally use internally generated funds and short term borrowing to satisfy most of our capital requirements. We may periodically issue additional long term debt to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. Wisconsin Public Service issued $150.0 million of 6.125% senior notes in the third quarter of 2001, with part of the proceeds used to refinance $53.1 million of 8.8% first mortgage bonds. The remainder of the proceeds was used to reduce short term debt and support working capital requirements. The senior notes are secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds but become unsecured if Wisconsin Public Service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds. Wisconsin Public Service makes large investments in capital assets. Net construction expenditures, including nuclear fuel, for Wisconsin Public Service are expected to be approximately $565 million in the aggregate for the 2002 through 2004 period. Larger projects include $60 million for automated meter reading, $27 million for computer software and systems, and $68 million for the start of construction of generation facilities that will continue to be constructed through 2007. Other capital requirements for Wisconsin Public Service for the three year period include contributions of $7.8 million to the Kewaunee plants decommissioning trust fund. In 2004, the second phase of Wisconsin Public Services agreement to purchase electricity from the De Pere Energy Center, a gas fired cogeneration facility, will be accounted for as a capital lease. The De Pere Energy Center lease will be capitalized at approximately $80 million. Regulatory On December 21, 2000, Wisconsin Public Service received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing a 5.4% increase in retail electric rates and a 1.5% increase in retail natural gas rates for 2001 and 2002. A 12.1% return on equity was approved. The new rates were implemented on January 1, 2001. On April 12, 2001, Wisconsin Public Service filed an application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for additional rate relief in 2002. Wisconsin Public Service requested an $86.8 million, or 16.1%, increase in retail electric rates and a $13.5 million, or 4.5%, increase in retail natural gas rates for 2002. Wisconsin Public Service requested a 12.6% return on equity, with equity constituting 55% of the capital structure. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsins order, originally expected to be issued in January 2002, has now been delayed until April of 2002. Wisconsin Public Service received an interim rate order on December 19, 2001 and implemented interim rates on January 1, 2002. The order authorized a $55.5 million, or 10.3%, retail electric rate increase and a $11.2 million, or 4.7% retail natural gas rate increase. Interim rates are based on a 12.1% return on equity, with equity constituting 55% of the capital structure, are subject to refund to the extent interim revenues exceed revenues authorized in the final rate order, and will be in effect until superseded by the final rate order establishing new rates. Wisconsin Public Service anticipates that it will not be required to refund revenues collected under the interim rates. Merger with Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company The merger of Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company into Wisconsin Public Service was completed on April 1, 2001. Wisconsin Fuel and Light shareholders received 1.73 shares of WPS Resources common stock for each share of Wisconsin Fuel and Lights common stock. A total of 1,763,943 shares were issued resulting in a purchase price of $54.8 million based on an average price of $31.0625, the prevailing price at the time of the merger announcement. Wisconsin Public Service used the purchase method of accounting and recorded $41.9 million of total premium associated with the purchase. Of that total, $36.1 million was recorded as goodwill and $5.8 million after tax was recorded as an acquisition adjustment included in plant. The acquisition adjustment is expected to be recovered in Wisconsin retail rates over the period 2003 2005 as approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. American Transmission Company, LLC In the first quarter of 2001, Wisconsin Public Service transferred transmission assets at their net book value to American Transmission Company in exchange for cash and an approximate 11% ownership interest in American Transmission Company. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin initiated a generic docket to address the potential recovery of deferred 2000 and 2001 start up costs and increased transmission operating costs of American Transmission Company by the member Wisconsin utilities including Wisconsin Public Service. Completion of the docket is anticipated in the spring of 2002 and should identify the costs to be recovered and the method for recovery. Wisconsin Public Service began recovering some of these costs, as a result of its interim rate case order, which was implemented January 1, 2002. The interim recovery of these costs is subject to refund should the costs in the final generic docket be less than the costs included in the interim rates. American Transmission Company implemented new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tariffs, subject to refund, on January 1, 2001. Settlements related to issues surrounding these tariffs were approved in late 2001. The settlement reduced transmission rates for Wisconsin Public Service by approximately $8 million during the 2001 2005 phase in period. On August 17, 2001, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved the construction of a 220 mile 345 kV transmission line from Wausau, Wisconsin to Duluth, Minnesota. The joint project of Wisconsin Public Service and Minnesota Power had received the approval of the Minnesota Public Service Commission in March of 2001. Construction of the line is expected to begin in 2002 with completion in 2005. Our funding obligation of the construction costs is estimated to be between $46 million and $92 million. The line will eventually be contributed to American Transmission Company for an increased equity interest in American Transmission Company. Kewaunee Nuclear Plant On January 1, 2001, Wisconsin Public Services administrative employees at the Kewaunee plant transferred to Nuclear Management Company, LLC. As a result of these employees leaving the Wisconsin Public Service benefit plans, a curtailment loss of $8.8 million was experienced. Most of the curtailment loss was deferred as a regulatory asset. We recognized settlement gains of $12.8 million in 2001 a result of these employees and other former employees taking withdrawals from the pension plan during the year. The majority of the settlement gains were recorded as a regulatory liability. Wisconsin Public Service will return the net of settlement gains and curtailment losses to ratepayers in future rates. The Kewaunee plants co owners received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to apply deferred accounting treatment beginning March 27, 2001 to the incremental costs associated with compliance with certain Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements mandating improvements to plant procedures. Wisconsin Public Service received an order to recover the deferred costs subject to review by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in a future rate proceeding. Wisconsin Public Service has deferred approximately $10 million as a regulatory asset through December 31, 2001. On September 24, 2001, Wisconsin Public Service acquired Madison Gas and Electrics 17.8% interest in the Kewaunee plant for $17.5 million. This acquisition increased Wisconsin Public Services ownership interest in the Kewaunee plant to 59%. Security On December 19, 2001, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized Wisconsin Public Service to defer additional costs incurred with regard to increased security measures at Kewaunee and other facilities. The deferred security costs will be addressed in Wisconsin Public Services rate proceeding to be filed in 2002 for 2003 rate relief. Wisconsin River Power Company Wisconsin Public Services ownership interest in Wisconsin River Power Company decreased to 50% effective December 31, 2001 as the result of the sale of a portion of its ownership interest to Wisconsin Power and Light. Asset Management Strategy In December 2001, Wisconsin Public Service sold 5,740 acres of land on the Peshtigo River in northeastern Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for $13.5 million. This sale was the first significant transaction in a five to seven year asset management strategy that WPS Resources adopted in 2001. The agreement with the Department of Natural Resources includes two options, one exercisable in 2003 and the other in 2004, whereby the Department may acquire, at less then fair value, approximately 5,000 additional acres for $11.5 million if both options are exercised. The value associated with the difference between the option price and the fair value will be treated as a charitable contribution. TRENDS WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE See WPS RESOURCES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for information regarding trends. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks WPS Resources has potential market risk exposure for instruments entered into for trading purposes related to commodity price risk and for instruments entered into for purposes other than trading related to interest rate risk, equity return and principal preservation risk, and commodity price risk. There currently is no material exposure due to foreign currency exchange rate risk. WPS Resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures. Interest Rate Risk WPS Resources is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term commercial paper borrowing. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. WPS Resources enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so. The company may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2001, WPS Resources utilized one interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on a variable rate loan at one of its nonregulated subsidiaries. Based on WPS Resources variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2001, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points in 2002 would increase annual interest expense by approximately $0.6 million. Comparatively, based on WPS Resources variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased interest expense in 2001 by approximately $1.8 million. These hypothetical changes are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would take action to mitigate the companys exposure to the change. Commodity Price Risk WPS Resources is exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the impact of market fluctuations in the price of certain commodities, including but not limited to electricity, natural gas, coal, fuel oil, and uranium, which are used and or sold by our subsidiaries in the normal course of their business. We employ established policies and procedures to reduce the market risk associated with changing commodity prices, including using various types of commodity and derivative instruments. WPS Resources exposure to commodity price risk in its utility business is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale. Therefore, the below value at risk amounts do not include measures for WPS Resources regulated utilities. To further manage commodity price risk, our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various duration for the purchase and or sale of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and electricity. WPS Power Development also uses purchase and or sale contracts for electric fuel and electricity to help manage its commodity price risk. For purposes of risk management disclosure, all of WPS Power Developments activities are classified as non trading. WPS Energy Services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with the changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers. WPS Energy Services also utilizes these instruments to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases, as well as trading activities. For purposes of risk management disclosure, all of WPS Energy Services activities, including all of its energy commodity purchase and sale contracts and its gas in storage inventory, are classified as trading. WPS Energy Services therefore follows mark to market accounting as required by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10. Value at Risk To measure commodity price risk exposure, WPS Resources performs a value at risk (VaR) analysis of its exposures. VaR is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from adverse changes in market factors, within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period. VaR models are relatively sophisticated. However, the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model. The instruments being used may have features that may trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used. VaR is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur. At WPS Resources, VaR is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a 95% confidence level. The delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods, such as one day, are normally distributed. It does not take into account higher order risk exposures, so it may not provide a good approximation of the risk in a portfolio with substantial option positions. We utilized a delta normal approximation because our portfolio has limited exposure to optionality. Our VaR calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options as well as commodities held in inventory, such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant. Our VaR amount for trading activities was calculated to be $0.5 million at December 31, 2001 compared with $0.4 million at December 31, 2000. Our VaR amount for non trading activities was calculated to be $3.2 million at December 31, 2001 compared with $4.4 million at December 31, 2000. A significant portion of the VaR amount related to non trading activities is mitigated by WPS Power Developments generating capabilities, which are excluded from the VaR calculation as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the average, high, and low VaR amounts for trading activities were $0.4 million, $0.6 million, and $0.2 million, respectively. The same amounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $0.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001 the average, high, and low VaR amounts for non trading activities were $3.0 million, $4.4 million, and $1.4 million, respectively. The same amounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $2.2 million, $4.4 million, and $1.1 million. The average, high, and low amounts were computed using the VaR amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts. Equity Return and Principal Preservation Risk WPS Resources currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits and nuclear decommissioning through various external trust funds. These funds are managed by various investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. The pension liability is adequately funded and under normal market conditions future required contributions to the plan are unlikely. Changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits or nuclear decommissioning could impact future contributions. WPS Resources monitors the trust fund portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices. All decommissioning costs and most of the employee benefit costs relate to WPS Resources regulated utilities. As such, the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates, mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through the purchase and sale of gas in Canada by one of our nonregulated subsidiaries. This risk to WPS Resources at December 31, 2001 is immaterial.
