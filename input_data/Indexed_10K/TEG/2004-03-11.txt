ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION INTRODUCTION WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION WPS Resources Corporation is a holding company which is exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Our wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (which is an operating entity as well as a holding company exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935) and Upper Peninsula Power Company. Another wholly owned subsidiary, WPS Resources Capital Corporation, is a holding company for our nonregulated businesses, including WPS Energy Services, Inc. and WPS Power Development, Inc. Our regulated and nonregulated businesses have distinct competencies and business strategies, offer differing products and services, experience a wide array of risks and challenges, and are viewed uniquely by management. The following summary provides insight into the operations of our subsidiaries. Regulated Utilities Our regulated utilities include Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. Wisconsin Public Service derives its revenues primarily from servicing retail electric and natural gas customers in northeastern and central Wisconsin and an adjacent portion of Upper Michigan. Wisconsin Public Service also provides wholesale electric service to various customers, including municipal utilities, electric cooperatives, energy marketers, other investor owned utilities, and a municipal joint action agency. Upper Peninsula Power derives revenues from the sale of electric energy in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The ability of our regulated utilities to earn their approved return on equity is dependent upon accurate budgeting and forecasting techniques, our ability to obtain timely rate increases to account for rising cost structures, minimizing the required rate increases in order to maintain the competitiveness of our core industrial customer base and keep these customers in our service area, and certain conditions that are outside of our control, such as macroeconomic factors and weather conditions. An approximately three month delay in receiving retail electric rate relief played a significant role in Wisconsin Public Service not earning its approved return on equity in 2003. As a result of this delay, we met with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and established procedures and fixed timelines for completion of the 2004 rate case in order to allow the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to rule on a more timely basis. These efforts led to a timely rate order for 2004. Even with the higher retail electric rates, Wisconsin Public Services overall electric rates are among the lowest when compared to other investor owned utilities in Wisconsin and across the nation. The approved returns on equity for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula are 12.0% and 11.4%, respectively. Perhaps the most relevant risk to our regulated utilities is deregulation. Deregulation of the electric and natural gas utilities has begun in Wisconsin, especially for natural gas service. Currently, the largest natural gas customers can purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility. Efforts are underway to make it easier for smaller natural gas customers to do the same. In addition, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has been studying how to deregulate the states electric supply. We believe electric deregulation inside Wisconsin is at least several years off as the state is focused on improving reliability by building more generation and transmission facilities and creating fair market rules. As electric choice occurs, we believe we will lose some generation load but will retain the delivery revenues and margin. Also, the capacity that is freed up should be competitive in our marketplace. Deregulation of electricity is present in Michigan; however, no customers have chosen an alternative electric supplier and no alternative electric suppliers have offered to serve any customers in Michigans Upper Peninsula due to the lack of transmission capacity in the areas we serve in the Upper Peninsula, which is a barrier to competitive suppliers entering the market. 50 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Power Development WPS Power Development competes in the wholesale merchant electric power generation industry, primarily in the midwest and northeastern United States and adjacent portions of Canada. WPS Power Developments core competencies include power plant operation and maintenance, waste disposal, and material condition assessment of assets. Revenues are derived primarily through the sale of capacity and energy generated from plant assets through wholesale outtake contracts and into liquid financial markets, primarily the PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland), New York, and NEPOOL (New England Power Pool) markets, at spot prices or day ahead prices. Historically, risk management activities have not been utilized significantly at WPS Power Development. Excluding discontinued operations (the operation of the Sunbury generation plant, which is pending sale, and certain other related assets), WPS Power Development has approximately 425 megawatts of existing capacity, with fixed price contracts in place to sell approximately 86 megawatts. The majority of the remaining 339 megawatts of generation have been leased to WPS Energy Services under an operating lease effective January 2004, as discussed in more detail below. WPS Power Development, through its subsidiary ECO Coal Pelletization #12 LLC, also owns an interest in a synthetic fuel producing facility. See Trends WPS Resources, Synthetic Fuel Operation for more information. WPS Power Developments ability to generate revenues is dependent upon open access to physical markets and liquid financial markets. We are not currently aware of any significant changes in the physical markets in which WPS Power Development operates. In addition, we believe that financial markets are becoming more liquid with the addition of large financial players. WPS Power Development is subject to clean air regulations enforced by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. New legislation could require significant capital outlays that may impact WPS Power Developments ability to compete with regulated utilities, which are allowed recovery of these costs. Oversupply of capacity, low spark spreads (spark spread is the difference between the market price of electricity and its cost of production), and extreme volatility in the price of fuel, energy, and capacity values have negatively impacted margins at WPS Power Development. In response to these market conditions, WPS Power Development has taken steps to adjust to the current wholesale merchant environment. WPS Power Development has instituted workforce reductions at the central office and at various New York and Pennsylvania plants. On October 23, 2003, a definitive agreement was entered into to sell WPS Power Developments Sunbury generating facility to a subsidiary of Duquesne Light Holdings. The pending sale of Sunbury will allow WPS Power Development to reduce uncontracted merchant exposure and redeploy capital into markets with different risk profiles. In addition, in January 2004, WPS Power Development entered into operating lease agreements with WPS Energy Services as part of its asset management strategy. This partnership will enable WPS Power Development to focus on efficient and effective operation of its plants and is expected to reduce market price risks associated with the merchant generation plants by utilizing WPS Energy Services financial and physical product trading expertise. WPS Energy Services will utilize various financial tools, including forwards and options, to limit exposure, as well as to extract additional value from volatile commodity prices. Given current market conditions, we do not expect to see significant growth through the acquisition of generation assets, but we are continuing to look for growth opportunities that will allow us to extract synergies between WPS Power Development and WPS Energy Services that will enhance shareholder value. WPS Energy Services WPS Energy Services offers nonregulated natural gas, electric, and alternate fuel supplies, as well as energy management and consulting services, to retail and wholesale customers primarily in the northeastern quadrant of the United States and adjacent portions of Canada. Although WPS Energy 51 &lt;PAGE&gt; Services has a widening array of products and services, revenues are primarily derived through sales of electricity and natural gas. WPS Energy Services marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments. In 2003, WPS Energy Services purchased electricity required to fulfill these sales commitments primarily from independent generators, energy marketers, and organized electric power markets and purchased natural gas from a variety of suppliers under daily, monthly, seasonal, and long term contracts, with pricing delivery and volume schedules to accommodate customer requirements. WPS Energy Services customers include utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, commercial and industrial consumers, aggregators, and other marketing and retail entities. WPS Energy Services uses derivative financial instruments to provide flexible pricing to customers and suppliers, manage purchase and sales commitments, and reduce exposure relative to the volatility of market prices. The table below discloses future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract as of December 31, 2003. Contracts are generally one to three years in duration. WPS Energy Services expects that its ultimate sales volumes in 2004 and beyond will exceed the volumes shown in the table below as it continues to seek growth opportunities. Forward Contracted Volumes at 12/31/2003(1) 2004 2005 to 2007 2008 to 2009 Wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet 95.8 15.1 Retail sales volumes billion cubic feet 173.4 63.2 Total natural gas sales volumes 269.2 78.3 Wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours(2) 3,176 238 Retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours(2) 5,133 3,623 37 Total electric sales volumes 8,309 3,861 37 For comparative purposes, future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract at December 31, 2002 are shown below. Actual electric and natural gas sales volumes for 2003 are disclosed within Results of Operations WPS Resources Corporation, WPS Energy Services Segment Operations. Forward Contracted Volumes at 12/31/2002(1) 2003 2004 to 2006 2007 to 2008 Wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet 67.6 9.7 Retail sales volumes billion cubic feet 110.4 26.6 Total natural gas sales volumes 178.0 36.3 Wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours(2) 3,833 3,147 Retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours(2) 1,966 739 10 Total electric sales volumes 5,799 3,886 10 (1) These tables represent physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods. Management has no reason to believe that gross margins that will be generated by these contracts will vary significantly from those experienced historically. (2) WPS Energy Services acquired retail electric operations in Michigan in 2003. Prior to the acquisition, this operation was an electric wholesale customer of WPS Energy Services, therefore forward contracted volumes to this customer at December 31, 2002 were included in wholesale sales volumes. At December 31, 2003 forward contracted volumes related to this operation were included in retail sales volumes. 52 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Energy Services has experienced steady increases in electric and natural gas sales volumes since its inception, and expects this trend to continue as it continues to look for opportunities that fit within its growth strategy. In 2003, WPS Energy Services grew its retail electric business through the acquisition of retail operations in Michigan and participation in the New Jersey Basic Generation Service program. Natural gas volumes increased as a result of the expansion of its retail natural gas business in Canada. WPS Energy Services expects to continue to target acquisitions and participate in generation service programs within the area it serves. Although revenues are expected to grow in 2004, we do not anticipate earnings growth in 2004 since 2003 growth included the favorable settlement of several counterparty liabilities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting arising from the required adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 03, "Issues Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," with requirements that shifted margin recognition from 2004 to 2003. We anticipate long term earnings growth at WPS Energy Services in the range of 15% to 25%. As a company that participates in energy commodity markets, WPS Energy Services is exposed to a variety of risks, including market, operational, liquidity, and credit risks. Market risk is measured as the potential gain or loss of a portfolio that is associated with a price movement within a given probability over a specific period of time, known as value at risk. Through the use of derivative financial instruments, we believe we have reduced our value at risk to acceptable levels. Operational risk is the risk of loss from less than flawless execution of transactions, forecasting, scheduling, or other operational activities and is common to all companies participating in the energy marketing industry. WPS Energy Services continued investment in computational infrastructure, business process improvement, employee training, and internal controls has helped mitigate operational risk to date. Liquidity risk is an emerging risk, and one that has historically been less applicable to WPS Energy Services than many industry participants because of the financial support provided by WPS Resources in the form of guarantees to counterparties. A significant downgrade in WPS Resources credit ratings, however, could cause counterparties to demand additional assurances of payment. WPS Resources Board of Directors imposes restrictions on the amount of guarantees WPS Resources is allowed to provide to these counterparties in order to protect its credit ratings, and WPS Energy Services believes it would have adequate capital to continue core operations unless WPS Resources credit ratings fell below investment grade (Standard & Poors rating of BBB / Moodys rating of Baa3). The other category of risk mentioned above that WPS Energy Services faces is credit risk from retail and wholesale counterparties. In order to mitigate its exposure to credit risk, WPS Energy Services has implemented stringent credit policies. As a result of these credit policies, WPS Energy Services has not experienced significant write offs from its large wholesale counterparties to date. Write offs pertaining to retail counterparties were $3.1 million in 2003, or 0.2%, and we believe this write off percentage is within the range experienced by most energy companies. The table below summarizes wholesale counterparty credit exposure, categorized by maturity date, as of December 31, 2003 (in millions): 53 &lt;PAGE&gt; Counterparty Rating(1) Exposure(2) Exposure Less than 1 year Exposure 1 to 3 years Net Exposure of Counterparties Greater Than 10% of Net Exposure Investment grade regulated utility $ 5.9 $ 5.5 $ 0.4 $ Investment grade other 79.7 75.9 3.8 17.5 Non investment grade regulated utility 7.6 7.6 Non investment grade other 3.3 3.3 Non rated regulated utility 0.9 0.9 Non rated other 21.2 17.0 4.2 Total Exposure $118.6 $110.2 $ 8.4 $17.5 (1) The investment and non investment grade categories are determined by publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty or the rating of any guarantor, whichever is higher. Investment grade counterparties are those with a senior unsecured Moodys rating of Baa3 or above or a Standard & Poors rating of BBB or above. (2) Exposure considers netting of accounts receivable and accounts payable where netting agreements are in place as well as netting mark to market exposure. Exposure is before consideration of collateral from counterparties. Collateral, in the form of cash and letters of credit, received from counterparties totaled $6.2 million at December 31, 2003, all from non rated counterparties. As discussed above, WPS Energy Services is aiding WPS Power Development with its asset management, starting in January 2004. Over the past year, WPS Energy Services has positioned itself to mitigate price risks and optimize the market value associated with WPS Power Developments merchant generation facilities. WPS Energy Services expects to employ a variety of physical and financial instruments offered in the marketplace to limit risk exposure associated with fluctuating commodity prices and volumes, enhance value, and minimize cash flow volatility. While risks associated with the power generating capacity, retail electric, and natural gas sales will be commercially hedged, generally accepted accounting principles related to recognition of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments as represented in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 03, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," will preclude a perfect matching of gains and losses from the generating capacity with the physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods. The result could cause volatility in the reported earnings of WPS Energy Services. However, the financial impact of this timing difference would be reversed at the time of physical delivery and or settlement of the transactions. WPS Energy Services is also impacted by earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle, which runs annually from June to March. Injections of natural gas into inventory take place in the summer and natural gas is withdrawn in the winter months. WPS Energy Services policy is to hedge the price risk of all purchases for storage with sales in the over the counter and futures markets, eliminating the price risk for the storage assets. Current accounting rules allow for the marking to market of forward sales, but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim periods, but even out by the end of the storage cycle. At December 31, 2003 there were pre tax mark to market losses of $2.6 million recorded (related to the natural gas storage cycle) that are expected to reverse in the first quarter of 2004. 54 &lt;PAGE&gt; RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION 2003 Compared with 2002 WPS Resources Corporation Overview WPS Resources 2003 and 2002 results of operations are shown in the following table: WPS Resources Results (Millions, except share amounts) 2003 2002 Change Consolidated operating revenues $4,321.3 $1,461.1 196% Income available for common shareholders $94.7 $109.4 (13%) Basic earnings per share $2.87 $3.45 (17%) Diluted earnings per share $2.85 $3.42 (17%) Total revenues increased significantly due to the required reclassification of previously reported 2002 revenues and cost of sales (see WPS Energy Services Segment Operations below for further information). Total revenues also increased due to sales volume growth at WPS Energy Services, electric utility rate increases, and higher natural gas prices. The decrease in basic earnings per share in 2003 compared to 2002 was largely driven by an $18.2 million decrease in after tax gains recognized from sales of portions of our interest in a synthetic fuel operation, a $10.0 million increase in losses from discontinued operations, and a $5.1 million reduction in tax credits recognized from the synthetic fuel operation. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.0 million, or 164%, increase in income available for common shareholders at WPS Energy Services. Strategic acquisitions, customer growth, and favorable settlement of certain counterparty liabilities contributed to WPS Energy Services increased earnings. Also impacting basic earnings per share was an increase of 1.3 million in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of WPS Resources common stock in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was largely due to issuing 4,025,000 additional shares through a public offering in November 2003. Additional shares were also issued in 2003 under the Stock Investment Plan. Overview of Utility Operations Utility operations include the electric utility segment consisting of the electric operations of Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power and the gas utility segment comprising the natural gas operations at Wisconsin Public Service. Income available for common shareholders attributable to the electric utility segment was $60.0 million in 2003 compared to $61.0 million in 2002. Income available for common shareholders attributable to the gas utility segment was $15.7 million in 2003 compared to $18.4 million in 2002. Electric Utility Segment Operations WPS Resources Electric Utility Segment Results (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Revenues $814.1 $763.1 7% Fuel and purchased power costs 266.3 242.7 10% Margins $547.8 $520.4 5% Sales in kilowatt hours 14,346.7 14,547.6 (1%) 55 &lt;PAGE&gt; Electric utility segment revenues increased $51.0 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is largely due to retail and wholesale electric rate increases for our Wisconsin and Michigan customers in accordance with new rate orders. Wisconsin Public Service was granted authority to increase retail electric rates 3.5%, effective March 21, 2003, by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Wisconsin Public Service was granted authority for a $0.3 million increase in retail electric rates from the Michigan Public Service Commission, effective July 23, 2003. The Michigan Public Service Commission also authorized recovery of $1.0 million of increased transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery fuel adjustment clause. In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered a 21% interim increase in wholesale electric rates for Wisconsin Public Service effective May 11, 2003, subject to refund to the extent final rates are lower (final rates are anticipated in the second quarter of 2004). Upper Peninsula Power was granted authority to increase retail electric rates by 8.95%, effective December 20, 2002, by the Michigan Public Service Commission. The electric utility margin increased $27.4 million, or 5%, in 2003 compared to 2002. Due primarily to the electric rate increases mentioned above, electric margins at Wisconsin Public Service increased $20.2 million, or 4%. Electric margins at Wisconsin Public Service were also impacted favorably by a change in sales mix in 2003. While total sales volumes remained basically unchanged in 2003 compared to 2002, sales volumes to higher margin residential, and commercial and industrial customers increased slightly. The increase in sales volumes to these higher margin customer classes reflects growth within Wisconsin Public Services service area and recent changes in the economy. These increases were partially offset by cooler weather during the cooling season for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Electric margins at Upper Peninsula Power increased $7.2 million, or 17%, due primarily to the retail electric rate increase mentioned above, partially offset by a 3% decrease in sales volumes. The decrease in sales volumes can be attributed to less favorable weather conditions for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, and customer conservation of electricity made necessary due to a flood that occurred earlier in 2003. Although the electric utility margin increased, electric utility segment earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $1.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reason for the decrease in electric utility segment earnings is due to a decrease in earnings at Wisconsin Public Service attributed to a delay in receiving 2003 retail electric rate relief, together with rising operating expenses (primarily pension and medical costs). Rate relief for our increasing operating costs was expected on January 1, 2003; however, the increase in retail electric rates granted by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin was not effective until March 21, 2003. The delay in receiving rate relief was a significant factor in our inability to achieve our authorized 12% return on equity in 2003. The decrease in earnings experienced by Wisconsin Public Service was partially offset by a modest increase in earnings at Upper Peninsula Power Company due to the increase in rates. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows Wisconsin Public Service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to Wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range. Wisconsin Public Service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus 2% from forecasted costs on an annualized basis. See Liquidity and Capital Resources WPS Resources, Other Future Considerations, Regulatory for information on fuel filings related to 2003. 56 &lt;PAGE&gt; Gas Utility Segment Operations WPS Resources Gas Utility Segment Results (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Revenues $404.2 $310.7 30% Purchase costs 291.0 198.6 47% Margins $113.2 $112.1 1% Throughput in therms 854.5 845.4 1% Gas utility segment revenues increased $93.5 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in gas utility revenues is mostly due to a 39% increase in the average cost of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the prior year, partially offset by the 0.3% decrease in retail natural gas rates ordered by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, effective March 21, 2003. The natural gas utility margin for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $1.1 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in the natural gas utility margin can be attributed to a 1% increase in natural gas throughput volumes in 2003 compared to 2002. Natural gas throughput volumes to our higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased 6% in the aggregate, mostly as a result of colder weather in 2003 compared to 2002. Natural gas throughput volumes to our lower margin transport customers decreased 5% due to the rising price of natural gas together with their ability to use alternate fuel sources. Despite the modest increase in gas utility margins, gas utility earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $2.7 million compared to 2002. The decline is primarily due to rising operating expenses (primarily pension and medical costs) together with the decrease in natural gas rates mentioned above. Wisconsin Public Service passes changes in the total cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause, as allowed by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Michigan Public Service Commission under regulatory practice. Overview of Nonregulated Operations Nonregulated operations consist of natural gas, electric, and other sales at WPS Energy Services, a diversified energy supply and services company, and the operations of WPS Power Development, an electric generation company. WPS Energy Services and WPS Power Development are both reportable segments. WPS Energy Services income available for common shareholders increased to $29.0 million in 2003 compared with $11.0 million in 2002, primarily as a result of increased electric and natural gas margins discussed below. WPS Power Development recognized a net loss of ($7.9) million in 2003 compared to income available for common shareholders of $24.0 million in 2002. Despite an increase in margins, WPS Power Developments earnings were impacted by a decrease in gains recognized from the sale of portions of its interest in a synthetic fuel operation, increased losses from discontinued operations, and a decrease in the amount of tax credits recognized. 57 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Energy Services Segment Operations Total segment revenues at WPS Energy Services were $3,081.2 million in 2003 compared to $361.2 million in 2002. The total margin at WPS Energy Services was $86.8 million in 2003 compared to $48.4 million in 2002. WPS Energy Services nonregulated natural gas and electric operations are the primary contributors to revenues and margins and are discussed below. WPS Energy Services Natural Gas Results (Millions except sales volumes) 2003 2002 Change Nonregulated natural gas revenues $2,696.6 $245.1 1,000% Nonregulated natural gas cost of sales 2,652.5 210.2 1,162% Margins $ 44.1 $ 34.9 26% Wholesale sales volumes in billion cubic feet * 252.4 233.8 8% Retail sales volumes in billion cubic feet * 240.6 135.7 77% * Represents gross physical volumes WPS Energy Services nonregulated natural gas revenues increased $2,451.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the prior year. Approximately $997 million of the increase relates to the required adoption of Issue No. 02 03, effective January 1, 2003 (see Trends WPS Resources for more information about this accounting change). Volume growth driven by the acquisition of a retail natural gas business in Canada accounted for approximately $500 million of the increase in revenues in 2003. Most of the remaining increase can be attributed to higher natural gas prices compared to the prior year. Natural gas margins at WPS Energy Services increased $9.2 million, or 26%, in 2003 compared to 2002. Approximately $6 million of the increase related to the November 1, 2002 acquisition of a retail natural gas business in Canada. The remaining increase related to favorable settlements of pending liabilities with several counterparties, partially offset by the change in accounting prescribed by the required adoption of Issue 02 03. See Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principles below for further discussion. WPS Energy Services Electric Results (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Nonregulated electric revenues $382.2 $113.7 236% Nonregulated electric cost of sales 341.8 102.6 233% Margins $ 40.4 $ 11.1 264% Wholesale sales in kilowatt hours * 2,768.0 4,250.0 (35%) Retail sales in kilowatt hours * 6,435.3 2,703.6 138% * Represents gross physical volumes WPS Energy Services nonregulated electric revenues increased $268.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the prior year. Approximately $130 million of the increase relates to the required adoption of Issue 02 03. Another $88 million of the increase can be attributed to participation in the New Jersey Basic Generation Services program. WPS Energy Services acquired 700 megawatts of fixed price load and 250 megawatts of variable priced load for the period from August 1, 2003 to May 31, 2004 as a result of its participation in this program. The remaining increase in nonregulated electric revenues can be attributed to increased prices and expansion within existing service territories. WPS Energy Services also acquired retail electric operations in Michigan in 2003. Prior to the acquisition, this operation was an electric wholesale customer of WPS Energy Services; therefore the acquisition did not have a significant impact on total revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. The acquisition did, however account for most of the increase in retail sales volumes and related decrease in wholesale sales volumes in 2003 compared to 2002. 58 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Energy Services electric margin increased $29.3 million, or 264%, in 2003 compared to 2002. Approximately $26 million of the increase is due to acquisition synergies and improved management of retail operations in Michigan and participation in the New Jersey Basic Generation Service program. The remaining increase in WPS Energy Services electric margins is largely due to the impact of the change in accounting prescribed by the required adoption of Issue 02 03, which precludes mark to market accounting for nonderivative trading contracts. WPS Power Developments Segment Operations All revenues and costs of WPS Power Developments discontinued operations are combined and reported on a net basis in the WPS Resources Corporation Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Accordingly, the table below does not include the results of discontinued operations, which are discussed separately within Discontinued Operations below. WPS Power Developments Production Results (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Nonregulated other revenues $82.4 $59.4 39% Nonregulated other cost of sales 57.9 37.8 53% Margins $24.5 $21.6 13% WPS Power Developments revenues increased $23.0 million, or 39%, in 2003 compared to 2002. WPS Power Developments margin increased $2.9 million, or 13%, in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in revenues and margin was primarily the result of increased generation from generating assets acquired in New York on June 1, 2002, revenues from the Combined Locks Energy Center that became fully operational in the second quarter of 2002, and an increase in generation at the hydroelectric plants in Maine and Canada as a result of increased rainfall, higher capacity revenues, and increased pricing on a renegotiated outtake contract. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues and margins at WPS Power Developments Cassville, Wisconsin, facility as a result of the expiration of an energy and capacity outtake contract that was not renewed. Overview of Holding Company and Other Segment Operations Holding Company and Other operations include the operations of WPS Resources and WPS Resources Capital as holding companies and the nonutility activities at Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. Holding Company and Other operations experienced a net loss of ($2.1) million in 2003 compared to a net loss of ($5.0) million in 2002. The decrease in the net loss experienced is largely related to an increase in gains recognized on hydroelectric land sales in 2003 compared to 2002 (recorded as a component of miscellaneous income), primarily due to a $6.2 million pre tax gain recognized in 2003 from land sales to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The sale of these hydroelectric lands is part of our asset management strategy, which was initiated in 2001, and is intended to optimize shareholder return from the sale, development, or use of certain assets or entire business units. Operating Expenses WPS Resources Operating Expenses (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Operating and maintenance expense $459.5 $412.5 11% Depreciation and decommissioning expense 138.4 94.8 46% Taxes other than income 43.8 39.9 10% 59 &lt;PAGE&gt; Operating and maintenance expense Operating expenses increased $47.0 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Utility operating expenses increased $30.7 million, or 9%, in 2003 compared to 2002. Approximately $18 million of the increase reflects higher pension, postretirement medical, and active medical costs. The remaining increase pertains to costs incurred for plant maintenance related to the Kewaunee nuclear power plants scheduled refueling outage in 2003 (there was no refueling outage in 2002), additional operating expenses at the Kewaunee nuclear power plant, and wage increases. Operating expenses at WPS Energy Services increased $12.0 million, or 40%, in 2003 compared to 2002, largely due to costs associated with business expansion, including the acquisition of a retail natural gas business in Canada and a retail electric business in Michigan. The remaining increase is largely due to higher incentive compensation costs and the costs associated with a full year of operation of generation assets in New York that were purchased by WPS Power Development in June 2002. Depreciation and decommissioning expense Depreciation and decommissioning expense increased $43.6 million, or 46%, due primarily to an increase of $37.4 million resulting from increased realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets that resulted in recording decommissioning expense approximately equal to the gains recognized in miscellaneous income pursuant to regulatory practice. The increase in realized gains is due primarily to the change in investment strategy for Wisconsin Public Services qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets. Qualified decommissioning trust assets were transferred to more conservative investments in 2003 pending the sale of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant, thus triggering realized gains. Most of the remaining increase resulted from plant asset additions at Wisconsin Public Service and WPS Power Development. Taxes other than income Taxes other than income increased $3.9 million, or 10%, primarily due to an increase in gross receipts taxes paid by Wisconsin Public Service as a result of increased revenues. Other Income (Expense) WPS Resources Other Income (Expense) (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Miscellaneous income $63.6 $47.8 33% Interest expense and distributions of preferred securities (55.6) (55.8) 0% Minority interest 5.6 Other income (expense) $13.6 $ (8.0) Miscellaneous income Miscellaneous income increased $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in miscellaneous income is largely due to an increase in realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets of $36.4 million, which is primarily the result of the change in investment strategy for the qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets. The realized gains were offset by increased decommissioning expense, as discussed above. Miscellaneous income also increased $6.2 million as a result of the sale of land to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and $8.1 million resulting from an increase in earnings from equity investments. The increases in miscellaneous income were partially offset by lower gains from sales of ownership interests in WPS Power Developments synthetic fuel operation. WPS Power Development recognized a $7.6 million pre tax gain in 2003 compared with a $38.0 million pre tax gain in 2002 related to these sell downs. An increase in operating losses generated by the synthetic fuel operation due to increased production decreased miscellaneous income by approximately $3.5 million in 2003. The increased 60 &lt;PAGE&gt; operating losses were driven by our partners ability to utilize tax credits in 2003 and were offset by minority interest, which is discussed below. In the aggregate, the items mentioned above relating to the synthetic fuel operation resulted in a $33.9 million decrease in miscellaneous income. The 2003 gain resulted from the 2002 sale of a portion of WPS Power Developments interest in its synthetic fuel operation. Similar gains from the 2002 sale are expected to be recognized annually through 2007, dependent upon production at the synthetic fuel facility. The gain reported in 2002 resulted from a 2001 sell down of a portion of WPS Power Developments interest in a synthetic fuel operation, which was recognized in its entirety by December 31, 2002. Minority interest As a result of WPS Power Developments sale of an approximate 30% interest in its subsidiary, ECO Coal Pelletization #12 LLC, on December 19, 2002, $5.6 million of losses related to the synthetic fuel operation and reported in miscellaneous income were allocated to WPS Power Developments partner and reported as a minority interest. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 23.4% in 2003 compared to 19.5% in 2002. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2003 compared to 2002 is largely due to a decrease in tax credits that could be recognized from our ownership interest in a synthetic fuel operation. Tax credits recognized during the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $5.1 million compared to the prior year, due to the sale of a portion of our interest in the synthetic fuel operation on December 19, 2002. Lower taxable income in 2003 also reduced the amount of tax credits that could be claimed. Our ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in the recognition of $18.1 million of Section 29 tax credits as a reduction of federal income tax expense in 2003 compared to $23.2 million in 2002. The operations of our synthetic fuel facility generate tax credits, which we use to reduce our current federal income tax liability, with any remaining credits increasing our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years. The cumulative amount of credits carried forward at December 31, 2003 relating to our interest in the synthetic fuel facility was $52.3 million. Based on a review of all known facts and circumstances, management has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use these credits in the future. Discontinued Operations On October 24, 2003, a definitive agreement was entered into to sell WPS Power Developments Sunbury generation plant, subject to certain contingencies. As a result of such agreement, we have determined that the operations of the plant and certain other related assets meet the definition of discontinued operations per the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." The loss from discontinued operations increased to $22.7 million ($16.0 million after taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $9.9 million ($6.0 million after taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increased loss is largely due to a decrease in capacity sales in 2003 due to the expiration of a sales contract, an increase in variable production expenses related to increased emission costs, and an increase in operating costs. Operating costs increased in 2003 as a result of issues related to fuel quality and associated mechanical difficulties involving fuel delivery systems earlier in the year, operational issues related to newly installed environmental equipment in various boilers, and turbine outages. The increase in the loss from discontinued operations was partially offset by decreases in payroll and employee benefits as a result of a restructuring that took place at the end of 2002. 61 &lt;PAGE&gt; Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principles WPS Energy Services had been applying the accounting standards of Issue 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," from the first quarter of 2000 until this standard was rescinded by Issue 02 03 in October 2002. WPS Energy Services was defined as a trading company under Issue 98 10 and was required to mark all of its energy related contracts to market. On October 25, 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force rescinded Issue 98 10, thus precluding mark to market accounting for energy trading contracts entered into after that date that are not derivatives and requiring a cumulative change in accounting principle to be recorded effective January 1, 2003 for all nonderivative contracts entered into on or prior to October 25, 2002. On January 1, 2003, WPS Resources recorded a positive after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $3.5 million (primarily related to the operations of WPS Energy Services) to income available for common shareholders to remove from its balance sheet the mark to market effects of those contracts entered into on or prior to October 25, 2002 that do not meet the definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133, as amended. The cumulative effect of adopting this new accounting standard is expected to reverse upon the settlement of the contracts impacted by the standard. Most of these settlements are expected to occur in 2004. The required change in accounting had no impact on the underlying economics or cash flows of the contracts. In addition, the adoption of Statement No. 143 at WPS Power Development resulted in a $(0.3) million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the closure of an ash basin at the Sunbury generating plant. 2002 Compared with 2001 WPS Resources Corporation Overview WPS Resources 2002 and 2001 results of operations are shown in the following table: WPS Resources Results (Millions, except share amounts) 2002 2001 Change Consolidated operating revenues $1,461.1 $1,345.4 9% Income available for common shareholders $109.4 $77.6 41% Basic earnings per share $3.45 $2.75 25% Diluted earnings per share $3.42 $2.74 25% The increase in basic earnings per share in 2002 compared to 2001 was largely driven by a gain at WPS Power Development related to the 2001 sale of part of its synthetic fuel operations. The sale occurred in the fourth quarter of 2001, and we deferred recognition of a portion of the related gain on the sale pending the satisfaction of certain contingencies. In addition, WPS Energy Services income available for common shareholders increased 72%, primarily due to improved natural gas margins. A full year contribution from gas utility operations acquired in the spring of 2001, warmer than normal weather during the heating season in 2001, and a rate increase approved by regulators resulted in increased earnings from our gas utility in 2002. Also impacting basic earnings per share was an increase of 3.5 million in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of WPS Resources common stock in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was largely due to issuing 2.3 million additional shares through a public offering in the fourth quarter of 2001 and issuing 1.8 million shares in the merger of Wisconsin Fuel and Light into Wisconsin Public Service in the second quarter of 2001. Additional shares were also issued in 2002 under the Stock Investment Plan. Overview of Utility Operations Income available for common shareholders attributable to electric utility operations was $61.0 million in 2002 compared with $58.8 million in 2001. Income available for common shareholders attributable to gas utility operations was $18.4 million in 2002 compared with $8.9 million in 2001. 62 &lt;PAGE&gt; Utility margins at Wisconsin Public Service were impacted positively by a Public Service Commission of Wisconsin interim rate order, which was effective January 1, 2002, authorizing a 10.3% increase in Wisconsin retail electric rates and a 4.7% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates. In late June 2002, Wisconsin Public Service received a final 2002 rate order that authorized a 10.9% increase in Wisconsin retail electric rates and a 3.9% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates. The final order authorized a lower retail natural gas rate increase than was approved in the interim order resulting in a $0.4 million refund to Wisconsin Public Services natural gas customers. Electric Utility Segment Operations Our electric utility segment margin increased $84.2 million, or 19%, due to the Wisconsin retail electric rate increases at Wisconsin Public Service and higher overall electric utility sales volumes. WPS Resources Electric Utility Segment Results (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Revenues $763.1 $675.7 13% Fuel and purchased power costs 242.7 239.5 1% Margins $520.4 $436.2 19% Sales in kilowatt hours 14,547.6 13,532.8 7% Our electric utility segment revenues increased $87.4 million, or 13%, in 2002 as the result of the electric rate increases and an 8% increase in overall electric sales volumes at Wisconsin Public Service. Sales volumes were up 25% for lower margin, wholesale customers while sales to higher margin, residential customers increased 6% and sales to higher margin, commercial and industrial customers increased 3%. Summer weather was 7% warmer in 2002 than in 2001, and 23% warmer than normal. Increased fuel costs for power generation were partially offset by lower purchased power expenses. Fuel expense for generation plants increased $4.9 million, or 4%, in 2002. Purchased power expense, however, decreased $2.7 million, or 3%, in 2002. Overall generation from Wisconsin Public Services plants increased 10% while purchased volumes decreased 3%. The change in the energy supply mix was largely due to the availability of less expensive power generation from the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. Wisconsin Public Service increased its ownership interest in the Kewaunee nuclear power plant to 59% in September 2001. Although Upper Peninsula Powers purchased volumes remained fairly consistent, the unit cost of its purchased power decreased 9%. As discussed previously, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows Wisconsin Public Service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to Wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range. Wisconsin Public Service did not submit any fuel filings in 2002. Gas Utility Segment Operations Effective April 1, 2001, the gas utility margin at Wisconsin Public Service includes the merged Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company operations. 63 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Resources Gas Utility Segment Results (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Revenues $310.7 $321.6 (3%) Purchase costs 198.6 230.2 (14%) Margins $112.1 $ 91.4 23% Throughput in therms 845.4 742.7 14% An increase in overall natural gas throughput volumes of 14% and the Wisconsin retail gas rate increase resulted in a higher gas utility margin of $20.7 million, or 23%, in 2002. Increased overall gas throughput volumes were partially the result of including 12 months of operations for former Wisconsin Fuel and Light in 2002 compared with the inclusion of 9 months of operations in 2001. Gas throughput volumes were also affected by a heating season that was 5% colder in 2002 than in 2001, but 3% milder than normal. Wisconsin Public Services gas revenues decreased $10.9 million, or 3%, in 2002 and gas purchase costs decreased $31.6 million, or 14%, largely as the result of a 26% decrease in the average unit cost of natural gas in 2002. Overview of Nonregulated Operations WPS Energy Services income available for common shareholders increased to $11.0 million in 2002 compared with $6.4 million in 2001 primarily due to a higher gas margin. WPS Power Developments income available for common shareholders increased to $24.0 million in 2002 compared with $2.3 million in 2001 largely due to recognition of a gain related to the 2001 sale of a portion of its synthetic fuel operations. WPS Energy Services Segment Operations Revenues at WPS Energy Services were $361.2 million in 2002 compared with $326.6 million in 2001, an increase of 11%. The increase was primarily the result of higher retail natural gas sales volumes in 2002. WPS Energy Services Gas Results (Millions except sales volumes) 2002 2001 Change Nonregulated natural gas revenues $245.1 $210.1 17% Nonregulated natural gas cost of sales 210.2 194.2 8% Margins $ 34.9 $ 15.9 119% Wholesale sales volumes in billion cubic feet 233.8 242.8 (4%) Retail sales volumes in billion cubic feet 135.7 104.5 30% Nonregulated gas revenues at WPS Energy Services increased $35.0 million, or 17%, in 2002 primarily as the result of higher natural gas sales volumes in 2002. The nonregulated gas margin increased $19.0 million, or 119%, in 2002 due to improved management of the retail gas procurement and volume risk processes and increased retail sales volumes. 64 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Energy Services Electric Results (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Nonregulated electric revenues $113.7 $112.7 1% Nonregulated electric cost of sales 102.6 99.4 3% Margins $ 11.1 $ 13.3 (17%) Wholesale sales in kilowatt hours 4,250.0 1,696.6 151% Retail sales in kilowatt hours 2,703.6 1,944.7 39% Nonregulated electric revenues at WPS Energy Services increased $1.0 million, or 1%, in 2002 due to higher sales volumes. The nonregulated electric margin decreased $2.2 million, or 17%, in 2002 primarily due to the slow economy which produced less favorable market conditions for opportunity sales in 2002. WPS Power Developments Segment Operations WPS Power Developments Production Results (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Nonregulated other revenues $59.4 $56.6 5% Nonregulated other cost of sales 37.8 48.7 (22%) Margins $21.6 $ 7.9 173% Revenues at WPS Power Development were $59.4 million in 2002 compared with $56.6 million in 2001, an increase of 5%. The increase was primarily due to the operation of the generation assets acquired in New York in the second quarter of 2002 and the operation of the Combined Locks Energy Center. As new generation assets are acquired or constructed, WPS Power Developments output is increased, providing new sales opportunities. Partially offsetting these increases were a change in accounting from consolidation to equity method accounting for WPS Power Developments synthetic fuel operations and lower revenues from steam sales. WPS Power Development experienced an increase of $13.7 million, or 173%, in its margin in 2002. The operation of the generation assets acquired in New York and the startup of the Combined Locks Energy Center contributed to WPS Power Developments higher margin in 2002. A change in accounting for WPS Power Developments synthetic fuel operations also increased 2002 margins by approximately $4.3 million. As a result of the November 2001 sale of a portion of WPS Power Developments synthetic fuel operations, WPS Power Development no longer consolidates these operations as a part of revenue and cost of sales. After the sell down, WPS Power Development became a minority owner, and therefore accounts for its interest in the synthetic fuel operations under the equity method of accounting. As a result of no longer consolidating the synthetic fuel operations, WPS Power Developments margins increased because this business had negative margins in 2001. Overview of Holding Company and Other Segment Operations Holding Company and Other operations experienced a net loss of $(5.0) million in 2002 compared with income available for common shareholders of $1.3 million in 2001. A net loss was experienced in 2002 primarily due to interest expense from financing to provide funds for subsidiary operations. Hydro land sales, which are part of our asset management strategy, resulted in pretax gains of $3.3 million in 2002 compared with pretax gains of approximately $17 million in 2001. In addition, earnings on equity investments were higher in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to our investment in American Transmission Company. 65 &lt;PAGE&gt; Operating Expenses WPS Resources Operating Expenses (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Operating and maintenance expense $412.5 $333.0 24% Depreciation and decommissioning expense 94.8 84.1 13% Taxes other than income 39.9 36.7 9% Operating and maintenance expense Operating and maintenance expense increased $79.5 million, or 24%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 2001. Utility operating and maintenance expense increased $67.6 million in 2002 largely due to amortization of regulatory deferrals, increased benefit costs, higher transmission expenses associated with American Transmission Company, increased expenses at the Kewaunee nuclear power plant (as a result of Wisconsin Public Service acquiring additional ownership interest in the plant), and increased energy conservation expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses at WPS Energy Services increased $7.3 million in 2002, largely due to costs associated with business expansion and increased bad debt expense. Operating expenses at WPS Power Development increased $4.3 million in 2002 primarily due to costs associated with the generation assets in New York that were purchased by WPS Power Development in June 2002 and operation of the Combined Locks Energy Center. Depreciation and decommissioning expense Depreciation and decommissioning expense increased $10.7 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 2001. Utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased $7.8 million in 2002 largely due to additional plant assets at Wisconsin Public Service, including its increased ownership interest in the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. Lower depreciation expense of $5.5 million related to decreased decommissioning earnings partially offset the increased plant asset depreciation. WPS Power Developments depreciation expense increased $2.4 million in 2002 due to additional plant assets, including the Combined Locks Energy Center and the assets obtained in the CH Resources acquisition. Depreciation and decommissioning expense at WPS Energy Services did not change significantly from the prior year. Taxes other than income Taxes other than income increased $3.2 million, or 9%, primarily due to an increase in gross receipts taxes paid by Wisconsin Public Service as a result of increased revenues. Other Income (Expense) WPS Resources Other Income (Expense) (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Miscellaneous income $47.8 $37.5 27% Interest expense and distributions of preferred securities (55.8) (53.4) 4% Other income (expense) $ (8.0) $(15.9) 50% 66 &lt;PAGE&gt; Miscellaneous income Miscellaneous income increased $10.3 million, or 27%, in 2002 compared to 2001. WPS Power Developments miscellaneous income increased $25.1 million in 2002 primarily as the result of recognizing a pretax gain of $38.0 million related to the 2001 sale of part of WPS Power Developments synthetic fuel operations. WPS Power Development recognized a pretax gain of $2.2 million on the sale in the fourth quarter of 2001 and deferred the remaining portion of the gain pending satisfaction of certain contingencies, including the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. The contingencies were satisfied in 2002 and the remaining gain was recognized. WPS Power Development also recognized royalties of $2.3 million in 2002 related to its synthetic fuel operations. Partially offsetting these factors were equity method losses for WPS Power Developments synthetic fuel operations. Utility miscellaneous income decreased $8.1 million in 2002 primarily as the result of lower earnings of $5.7 million on Wisconsin Public Services nuclear decommissioning trust assets. Due to regulatory practice, a decrease in earnings on the trust assets is largely offset by decreased depreciation expense. Miscellaneous income related to Holding Company and Other operations also decreased in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease is largely due to a $13.7 million decrease in gains realized from the sale of hydroelectric lands in 2002, partially offset by increased earnings on equity investments due to the investment in American Transmission Company. Interest expense and distributions of preferred securities Interest expense increased $2.4 million, or 4%, in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the increase in the amount of long term debt. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 19.5% in 2002 compared to 9.5% in 2001. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2002 compared to 2001 is largely due to a decrease in tax credits recognized from our ownership interest in a synthetic fuel operation. We used tax credits to the extent the tax law permits to reduce our current federal income tax liability, with any remaining credits increasing our alternative minimum tax credit available for future years. Discontinued Operations The after tax loss from discontinued operations decreased to $6.0 million in 2002 from $6.9 million in 2001. While we were able to improve the operating performance of our discontinued generation plant, market conditions for capacity in the area in which this plant participates continued to degrade, which resulted in continued losses. BALANCE SHEET WPS RESOURCES 2003 Compared with 2002 Accounts receivable, net of reserves, increased $209.1 million, or 71%, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 largely due to a $199 million increase in WPS Energy Services accounts receivable. The increase in receivables at WPS Energy Services is due to a significant increase in electric and natural gas sales volumes combined with significantly higher natural gas prices. Inventories increased $68.0 million, or 62%, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. Inventories at Wisconsin Public Service increased approximately $18 million, or 39%, in correlation with the 39% increase in the average price of natural gas experienced by this business in 2003. WPS Energy Services stored gas inventories increased approximately $50 million, or 82%, due to higher anticipated sales in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the first quarter of 2003 and increased natural gas prices. 67 &lt;PAGE&gt; Current assets from risk management activities increased $111.5 million, or 27%, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, and current liabilities from risk management activities increased $73.5 million, or 17%. Long term assets from risk management activities decreased $31.0 million, or 23%, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 and long term liabilities from risk management activities decreased $17.5 million, or 16%. These variances were largely due to changes in the forward price curve for natural gas and increased volumes. Property, plant, and equipment, net, increased $116.4 million to $1,828.7 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $1,712.3 million at December 31, 2002. WPS Resources adopted Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective January 2003, and as a result, capitalized a net asset retirement cost of $90.8 million (decreased to $78.5 million at December 31, 2003 due to depreciation). The remaining increase in property, plant, and equipment, net, primarily relates to capital expenditures at Wisconsin Public Service for the Pulliam combustion turbine and gas and electric distribution equipment. The Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission recently expressed their views on the balance sheet classification of costs of removal for the utility industry and required that the amounts be reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a liability. As a result, WPS Resources reclassified costs of removal out of accumulated depreciation at December 31, 2003 and 2002. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about these accounting changes. Other long term assets increased $83.5 million, or 31%, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 as a result of our investment in Guardian Pipeline, additional investments in American Transmission Company, and the recognition of an intangible pension asset related to the minimum pension liability we recorded at December 31, 2003. Accounts payable increased $58.7 million at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. The accounts payable balance at WPS Energy Services increased approximately $110 million as a result of an increase in electric and natural gas purchases required to supply its larger customer base and the significant increase in natural gas prices compared to the prior year. The increase experienced by WPS Energy Services was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable at Wisconsin Public Service, largely due to a $48.4 million payable that was recorded at December 31, 2002 resulting from the purchase of the De Pere Energy Center. This amount was paid in 2003. Other current liabilities increased $33.8 million, or 64%, in 2003 largely due to an increase in customer prepayments experienced at WPS Energy Services. Regulatory liabilities increased $254.7 million at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002, largely due to the reclassification of $180.0 million of non legal costs of removal from nuclear decommissioning and other cost of removal to regulatory liabilities. Most of the remaining increase relates to a regulatory liability that was recorded upon the adoption of Statement No. 143. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about this accounting change. Pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased $67.1 million, or 95%, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 due primarily to the minimum pension liability that was recorded at December 31, 2003 for our administrative pension plan, driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to value our obligation under this plan. The $344.0 million asset retirement obligation recorded at December 31, 2003 is related to a legal retirement obligation recorded as a result of our adoption of Statement No. 143 for the decommissioning of the irradiated portions of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about this accounting change. The $463.3 million liability for nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal at December 31, 2002 was reclassified from accumulated depreciation in accordance with recent views expressed by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the utility industry. Historically, these costs of removal were reflected as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation in accordance with 68 &lt;PAGE&gt; regulatory treatment. Upon adoption of Statement No. 143 on January 1, 2003, costs of removal with associated legal obligations of $290.5 million were removed from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal as these costs are now accounted for as asset retirement obligations. At December 31, 2003, costs of removal without an associated legal obligation, as defined by Statement No. 143, were reclassified to a regulatory liability pursuant to Statement No. 71. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about this accounting change. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES WPS RESOURCES We believe that our cash balances, liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity made available because of strong credit ratings, when taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control. In addition, our borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. Currently, we believe these ratings are among the best in the energy industry (see Financing Cash Flows, Credit Ratings below). Operating Cash Flows During 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was $62.4 million, compared with $188.5 million in 2002. The decrease is primarily due to increased working capital requirements, specifically at WPS Energy Services and Wisconsin Public Service. Inventories increased due to high natural gas prices at both WPS Energy Services and Wisconsin Public Service, as well as business growth at WPS Energy Services. The inventory increase is also the result of WPS Energy Services taking advantage of opportunities to put additional gas into storage at favorable relationships to forward prices. The change in receivables and payables was also attributable to the high natural gas prices as well as the business growth at WPS Energy Services. During 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $188.5 million, compared with $144.1 million in 2001. The increase is primarily due to an increase in income available for common shareholders after adjustment for certain non cash items, partially offset by an increase in cash used for working capital items. The increase in accounts receivable was the result of increased sales volumes at Wisconsin Public Service and WPS Energy Services due to colder weather and customer growth. Increased natural gas purchases at Wisconsin Public Service and WPS Energy Services as the result of colder weather and customer growth contributed to the higher accounts payable balance. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used for investing activities was $244.0 million in 2003 compared to $265.4 million in 2002, a decrease of $21.4 million. The decrease is largely attributed to a $34.1 million decrease in capital expenditures, mainly at the utilities, as well as a $24.3 million increase in cash received from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions. See Asset Sales and Acquisitions below for further detail. Cash used for investing activities was $265.4 million in 2002 compared to $134.8 million in 2001, an increase of $130.6 million. These factors were partially the result of cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions (discussed in more detail in Asset Sales and Acquisitions below), a decrease in the sale of property, plant, and equipment, and a decrease in return of capital from the American Transmission Company. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. The decrease in return of capital is due to the fact that in 2001 WPS Resources transferred transmission assets at their net book value to American Transmission Company in exchange for cash and an approximate 15% ownership interest in American Transmission Company. The decrease in the sale of property, plant, and equipment from 2002 to 2001 was due to the 2001 sale of land on the Peshtigo 69 &lt;PAGE&gt; River in northeastern Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, as well as WPS Power Developments transactions surrounding its synthetic fuel facility. Asset Sales and Acquisitions Certain acquisitions and asset sales that have a significant impact on investing cash flows are discussed below. In addition, see Note 6 in Notes to WPS Resources Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Sales of Assets for a more detailed discussion of asset sales and acquisitions. On December 30, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service sold an additional 542 acres of land near the Peshtigo River to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for $6.5 million as part of a multi phase agreement reached between the parties in 2001. Under the terms of the 2001 agreement, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources bought more than 5,000 acres of land for $13.5 million in 2001. The sale is part of a five to seven year asset management strategy adopted by WPS Resources in 2001. On April 18, 2003, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved Wisconsin Public Services request to transfer its interest in the Wausau, Wisconsin, to Duluth, Minnesota, transmission line to the American Transmission Company. American Transmission Company is a for profit transmission only company created by the transfer of transmission assets previously owned by multiple electric utilities serving the upper Midwest in exchange for an ownership interest in American Transmission Company. Wisconsin Public Service sold approximately $20.1 million of assets at book value related to the Wausau to Duluth transmission line to American Transmission Company in June 2003. No gain or loss was recognized on the transaction. Wisconsin Public Service will continue to manage construction of the project and be responsible for obtaining property rights necessary for the construction of the project. During 2003, WPS Resources invested an additional $19.9 million in American Transmission Company, increasing the consolidated WPS Resources ownership interest in American Transmission Company to 19.8%. WPS Resources contributed capital of $14.0 million to ECO Coal Pelletization #12 in 2003 and $11.7 million in 2002. On May 30, 2003, WPS Resources purchased a one third interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC from CMS Gas Transmission Company, for approximately $26 million. Guardian Pipeline owns a natural gas pipeline, which began operating in 2002, that stretches about 140 miles from near Joliet, Illinois, into southern Wisconsin. On December 16, 2002, Wisconsin Public Service purchased the 180 megawatt De Pere Energy Center for $120.4 million and terminated the related existing purchased power agreement. Wisconsin Public Service paid $72.0 million at the close of the transaction and the remaining $48.4 million in December 2003. Effective June 1, 2002, WPS Power Development acquired CH Resources, Inc. from Central Hudson Energy Services, Inc. for $61.1 million, including acquisition costs. CH Resources owns three power plants and associated assets in upstate New York with a combined capacity of 258 megawatts. In November 2001, WPS Power Development, through its subsidiary ECO Coal Pelletization #12, LLC, entered into a transaction to acquire the remaining interest in the synthetic fuel producing facility (partially owned by ECO #12) from its partner. Concurrently, with this transaction, WPS Power Development entered into a separate transaction with a subsidiary of a public company resulting in ECO #12 contributing 100% of its synthetic fuel producing machinery to a newly formed entity in exchange for cash and a one third ownership interest in the newly formed entity. These transactions generated a pre tax gain of $40.2 million, of which $38.0 million had been deferred as of December 31, 2001, as a result of certain rights of rescission and put options being granted to the buyer. WPS Power Development recognized all of the $38.0 million deferred gain in 2002. The actual payments for the purchase of the former partners interest in ECO #12 were contingent upon the same provisions referred to above. As a result, $21.3 million was originally held in escrow and 70 &lt;PAGE&gt; released proportionately as the respective rescission rights and put options expired. As of December 31, 2003, the escrow balance has been released as all contingencies have expired. On December 19, 2002, WPS Power Development sold a 30% interest in ECO #12. WPS Power Development received consideration of $3.0 million cash, as well as a fixed note and a variable note. Payments under the variable note are contingent upon the synthetic fuel facility achieving specified levels of synthetic fuel production. In conjunction with the sale, WPS Power Development agreed to make certain payments to a third party broker, consisting of an up front payment of $1.5 million (which was paid at the time of closing), $1.9 million which was paid in 2003, and an additional $1.9 million to be paid in 2004. A deferred gain of $9.2 million and $11.6 million was reflected on WPS Power Developments balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, a pre tax gain in the amount of $7.6 million was recognized as a component of miscellaneous income related to this transaction, of which $2.4 million related to the recognition of a portion of the deferred gain referenced above. Similar annual gains are expected to result from this transaction through 2007. There was no gain recognized in 2002 related to this transaction. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Electric Utility $131.0 $164.3 $175.8 Gas Utility 40.7 34.0 24.9 WPS Energy Services 1.4 0.8 10.9 WPS Power Development 3.3 8.2 27.7 Other (0.2) 3.0 5.0 WPS Resources Consolidated $176.2 $210.3 $244.3 Capital expenditures in the electric utility were higher in 2002, as compared to 2003, mainly due to the construction of portions of the Pulliam combustion turbine at Wisconsin Public Service in 2002. Gas utility capital expenditures increased due to the installation of automated meter reading in 2003. WPS Power Developments capital expenditures were higher in 2002 compared to 2003 due to the conversion of the Combined Locks Energy Center to a combined cycle system in 2002. Capital expenditures at WPS Energy Services remained fairly consistent between 2003 and 2002. As part of its regulated utility operations, on September 26, 2003 Wisconsin Public Service submitted an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin seeking approval to build a 500 megawatt coal fired generation facility near Wausau, Wisconsin. The facility is estimated to cost approximately $770 million (including the acquisition of coal trains), assuming the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows a current return on construction costs. As of December 31, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service has incurred a total cost of $4.0 million related to this project. In its 2003 rate order, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized deferral of costs related to development of the facility. On November 12, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service received a declaratory ruling allowing recovery of all reasonable costs (up to $71.2 million) related to the project incurred or committed to prior to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsins final decision regarding construction authorization. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service expects to incur additional construction costs of approximately $41 million to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support the generating facility through the date the generating facility goes into service. American Transmission Company will reimburse Wisconsin Public Service for the construction costs of the interconnection and related carrying costs when the generation facility becomes commercially operational. 71 &lt;PAGE&gt; On February 11, 2004, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin determined Wisconsin Public Services application is "complete". The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources now have 180 days to make a decision on the project. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin may request from the Dane County Court of Appeals one 180 day extension. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources will create an environmental impact statement. The public will have opportunities to testify at public hearings. Technical hearings will also be held. Following a review of the application, the environmental impact statement, and the hearing testimony, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin will determine if the proposed project will be approved, modified, or denied. On February 16, 2004, Wisconsin Public Service signed a Letter of Intent with Dairyland Power Cooperative for electric supply alternatives for 150 megawatts of energy from the proposed 500 megawatt coal fired generation facility. According to the agreement, Dairyland could choose to purchase an interest in the plant or buy electricity from it (we have since received written notification from Dairyland, confirming their intent to purchase an interest in the plant). In providing Dairyland with electric supply alternatives, Wisconsin Public Service can reduce the risks associated with building and operating the power plant. The agreement is part of Wisconsin Public Services continuing plan to provide least cost reliable energy for the increasing electric demand of its customers. This transaction is subject to a number of conditions including successfully developing a joint plant ownership and operating agreement, Dairyland obtaining financing approval from the Rural Utility Services, and Dairyland securing firm transmission service from the Midwest Independent System Operator on terms and conditions Dairyland deems acceptable. Capital expenditures at the electric utility were $11.5 million higher in 2001, as compared to 2002, mostly related to steam generator replacement at the Kewaunee nuclear power plant that occurred in 2001. In the gas utility segment, capital expenditures increased by $9.1 million in 2002, partially due to the installation of automated meter reading. The remaining increase is attributed to various one time projects that occurred in 2002. Capital expenditures at WPS Energy Services were $10.1 million higher in 2001 compared to 2002 due to the construction of a gas storage field in 2001. WPS Power Developments capital expenditures were $19.5 million higher in 2001 compared to 2002 due to the completion of the Combined Locks Energy Center construction in 2001. Financing Cash Flows Net cash provided by financing activities was $198.6 million in 2003 compared to $93.1 million in 2002. The $105.5 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2003 is primarily related to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2003 compared to 2002. A larger amount of investing activities was financed through common stock and debt issuances in 2003 as compared to the prior year. Our financing activities provided cash inflows of $93.1 million and $33.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2002 increase was due to new debt issuances used to finance investing activities, offset by an increase in repayments of long term debt and the capital lease (see Significant Financing Activities below for further detail). The net change in short term debt in 2002 from 2001 is attributable to the reduced need to rely on commercial paper in 2001 due to the 2001 issuance of additional long term debt at Wisconsin Public Service and common stock at WPS Resources. Significant Financing Activities As of December 31, 2003, both WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service were in compliance with all of the covenants under their lines of credit and other debt obligations. WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service established 364 day credit line syndications for $225.0 million and $115.0 million, respectively, during the third quarter of 2003. The 2002 credit line syndications were $180.0 million for WPS Resources and $100.0 million for Wisconsin Public Service. 72 &lt;PAGE&gt; The credit lines are used to back 100% of WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Services commercial paper borrowing programs and letters of credit for WPS Resources. WPS Resources had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $28.0 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. WPS Resources had outstanding short term debt of $10.0 million and $13.8 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, WPS Resources shelf registration statement for $350.0 million was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows WPS Resources to issue any combination of debt and equity. In November 2003, 4,025,000 shares of WPS Resources common stock were sold in a public offering at $43.00 per share, which resulted in a net increase in equity of $166.8 million. Net proceeds from this offering were used to retire $50.0 million of 7.0% trust preferred securities in January 2004, reduce short term debt, fund equity contributions to subsidiary companies, and for general corporate purposes. Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, under a registration statement declared effective in 2002, issued $125.0 million of 4.80% 10 year senior notes in December 2003. The senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if Wisconsin Public Service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to call $49.9 million of 7.125% first mortgage bonds on January 19, 2004, fund construction costs and capital additions, reduce short term indebtedness, and for other corporate utility purposes. Effective January 2001, we began issuing new shares of common stock under our Stock Investment Plan and under certain stock based employee benefit plans. Equity increased $31.0 million, $28.3 million, and $18.6 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, as a result of these plans. WPS Resources also repurchased $1.1 million, $1.3 million, and $1.1 million of outstanding common stock for stock based compensation plans in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Wisconsin Public Service used short term debt to retire $50.0 million of 6.8% first mortgage bonds on February 1, 2003 that had reached maturity. Wisconsin Public Service also called $9.1 million of 6.125% tax exempt bonds in May 2003. Wisconsin Public Service is evaluating the potential for refinancing existing debt in 2004. In March 2003, Upper Peninsula Power retired $15.0 million of 7.94% first mortgage bonds that had reached maturity. In November 2003, WPS Power Development retired all of the notes payable under a revolving credit note, in the amount of $12.5 million. In October 2002, Wisconsin Public Service retired $50.0 million of 7.30% first mortgage bonds that had reached maturity. WPS Resources issued $100 million of 5.375% 10 year senior non collateralized notes in November 2002. We used approximately $55 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes to repay short term debt incurred to provide equity capital to our subsidiaries and the remainder for other corporate purposes. Wisconsin Public Service issued $150.0 million of 4.875% 10 year senior notes in December 2002. The senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if Wisconsin Public Service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds. Wisconsin Public Service used approximately $72 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to acquire the De Pere Energy Center and $69 million to retire short term debt. The balance of the net proceeds was used for other corporate utility purposes. 73 &lt;PAGE&gt; Credit Ratings WPS Resources uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements. We also periodically issue long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. We may seek nonrecourse financing for funding nonregulated acquisitions. WPS Resources commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses and Upper Peninsula Power. Wisconsin Public Service has its own commercial paper borrowing program. The specific forms of long term financing, amounts, and timing depend on the availability of projects, market conditions, and other factors. The current credit ratings for WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys WPS Resources Corporation Senior unsecured debt Commercial paper Credit line syndication A A 1 A1 P 1 A1 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation Bonds Preferred stock Commercial paper Credit line syndication AA A A 1+ Aa2 A2 P 1 Aa3 In November 2003, Moodys downgraded its long term ratings for WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service one ratings level, leaving only commercial paper ratings unchanged. Moodys downgrade of WPS Resources was based principally on a gradual shift in the companys financial and business risk profile attributable to the growth of nonregulated businesses, the impact of weaker wholesale power markets, and a relatively high dividend payout. Moodys downgrade of Wisconsin Public Service is based on the expectation that the utilitys substantial capital spending program will exceed its retained cash flow through 2007, which is likely to lead to a meaningful increase in debt. Following the downgrade, Moodys set the ratings outlook at stable for both WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service. We believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry, and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a companys credit rating. These measures include business risk, liquidity risk, competitive position, capital mix, financial condition, predictability of cash flows, management strength, and future direction. Some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios, while the qualitative ones are more subjective. WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service hold credit lines to back 100% of their commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit. These credit facilities are based on a credit rating of A 1/P 1 for WPS Resources and A 1+/P 1 for Wisconsin Public Service. A decrease in the commercial paper credit ratings could adversely affect the companies by increasing the interest rates at which they can borrow and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the companies through the commercial paper market. A restriction in the companies ability to use commercial paper borrowing to meet their working capital needs would require them to secure funds through alternate sources resulting in higher interest expense, higher credit line fees, and a potential delay in the availability of funds. WPS Energy Services maintains underlying agreements to support its electric and gas trading operations. In the event of a deterioration of WPS Resources credit rating, many of these agreements allow the 74 &lt;PAGE&gt; counterparty to demand additional assurance of payment. This provision could pertain to existing business, new business or both with the counterparty. The additional assurance requirements could be met with letters of credit, surety bonds or cash deposits and would likely result in WPS Resources being required to maintain increased bank lines of credit or incur additional expenses, and could restrict the amount of business WPS Energy Services can conduct. WPS Energy Services uses the NYMEX and over the counter financial markets to hedge its exposure to physical customer obligations. These hedges are closely correlated to the customer contracts, but price movements on the hedge contracts may require financial backing. Certain movements in price for contracts through the NYMEX exchange require posting of cash deposits equal to the market move. For the over the counter market, the underlying contract may allow the counterparty to require additional collateral to cover the net financial differential between the original contract price and the current forward market. Increased requirements related to market price changes usually only result in a temporary liquidity need that will unwind as the sales contracts are fulfilled. Future Capital Requirements and Resources Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the contractual obligations of WPS Resources, including its subsidiaries. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2003 (Millions) Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Over 5 years Long term debt principal and interest payments $1,498.0 $ 112.9 $ 125.9 $126.8 $1,132.4 Operating leases 19.0 5.0 4.8 3.1 6.1 Commodity purchase obligations 3,052.7 2,016.7 718.4 243.9 73.7 Purchase orders 168.8 126.1 37.3 5.4 Capital contributions to equity method investment 206.5 47.3 96.4 62.8 Other 83.4 22.3 58.3 0.8 2.0 Total contractual cash obligations $5,028.4 $2,330.3 $1,041.1 $442.8 $1,214.2 Long term debt principal and interest payments represent bonds issued, notes issued, and loans made to WPS Resources and its subsidiaries. We record all principal obligations on the balance sheet. Commodity purchase obligations represent mainly commodity purchase contracts of WPS Resources and its subsidiaries. The energy supply contracts at WPS Energy Services summarized above generally have offsetting energy sale contracts. Wisconsin Public Service expects to recover the costs of its contracts in future customer rates. Purchase orders include obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations. Other mainly represents expected pension and post retirement funding obligations for the years of 2004 and 2005. Capital Requirements Wisconsin Public Service makes large investments in capital assets. Net construction expenditures are expected to be approximately $1,264 million in the aggregate for the 2004 through 2006 period (upon the closing of the sale of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant, expenditures would decrease approximately $44.9 million during this period). The largest of these expenditures is for the construction of the 500 megawatt coal fired generation facility near Wausau, Wisconsin, in which Wisconsin Public Service is expected to incur costs of $549 million between 2004 through 2006. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service expects to incur additional construction costs of approximately $12 million between 2004 and 2006 to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support the generating facility. Other significant anticipated expenditures during this three year period include: 75 &lt;PAGE&gt; combustion turbines $49 million pollution control equipment $23 million corporate services infrastructures $41 million automated meter reading $35 million nuclear fuel $33 million mercury control projects $59 million Other capital requirements for the three year period include a potential contribution of $3.3 million to the Kewaunee nuclear power plant decommissioning trust fund (depending on the sale of the Kewaunee assets). On April 18, 2003, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved Wisconsin Public Services request to transfer its interest in the Wausau, Wisconsin, to Duluth, Minnesota, transmission line to the American Transmission Company. WPS Resources committed to fund 50% of total project costs incurred up to $198 million, and receive additional equity in American Transmission Company. WPS Resources may terminate funding if the project extends beyond January 1, 2010. On December 19, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service and American Transmission Company received approval to continue the project with the new cost estimates of $420.3 million. The updated cost estimate reflects additional costs for the project resulting from time delays, added regulatory requirements, changes and additions to the project at the request of local governments and American Transmission Companys management, and overhead costs. Completion of the line is expected in 2008. WPS Resources has the right, but not the obligation, to provide additional funding in excess of $198 million up to its portion of the revised cost estimate. For the period 2004 through 2006, we expect to make capital contributions of up to $128 million for our portion of the Wausau to Duluth transmission line. In exchange, we will receive increased ownership in the American Transmission Company. WPS Resources expects to provide additional capital contributions of approximately $15 million to American Transmission Company in 2004 for other projects. Upper Peninsula Power is expected to incur construction expenditures of about $45 million in the aggregate for the period 2004 through 2006, primarily for electric distribution improvements and repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities. Capital expenditures identified at WPS Power Development for 2004 through 2006 are expected to be approximately $5 million, including $2.5 million at the Sunbury facility, which will be reimbursed by Duquesne Light Holdings if the sale of Sunbury is consummated (see Note 4 in Notes to WPS Resources Consolidated Financial Statements, Assets Held for Sale, for a more detailed discussion of the sale of the Sunbury facility). Capital expenditures identified at WPS Energy Services for 2004 through 2006 are expected to be approximately $2.7 million. All projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Other capital expenditures for WPS Resources and its subsidiaries for 2004 through 2006 could be significant depending on its success in pursuing development and acquisition opportunities. When appropriate, WPS Resources may seek nonrecourse financing for a portion of the cost of these acquisitions. 76 &lt;PAGE&gt; Capital Resources For the period 2004 through 2006, WPS Resources plans to use internally generated funds net of forecasted dividend payments, cash proceeds from pending asset sales, and debt and equity financings to fund capital requirements. WPS Resources plans to maintain current debt to equity ratios. Management believes WPS Resources has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs. WPS Resources has the ability to issue up to an additional $176.9 million of debt or equity under its currently effective shelf registration statement. Wisconsin Public Service has the ability to issue up to an additional $25.0 million of debt under its currently effective shelf registration statement. Wisconsin Public Service intends to file a new shelf registration statement in 2004 for an additional $350 million. WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service have 364 day credit line syndications for $225.0 million and $115.0 million, respectively. The credit lines are used to back 100% of WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Services commercial paper borrowing programs and letters of credit for WPS Resources. As of December 31, 2003, there was a total of $260.9 million available under the lines of credit, net of $28 million of outstanding commercial paper, and $50.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. In 2003, WPS Resources announced the sale of WPS Power Developments Sunbury generation plant and Wisconsin Public Service announced the sale of its portion of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. Both of these sales are expected to close in 2004. A portion of the proceeds related to the Sunbury sale may be used to pay the non recourse debt related to the plant. A portion of the proceeds related to the Kewaunee sale will be used to retire debt at Wisconsin Public Service. The remainder of the proceeds from both the Sunbury and Kewaunee sales will be used by WPS Resources for investing activities and general corporate purposes of its subsidiaries, including reducing the amount of outstanding debt. For more information regarding the Sunbury and Kewaunee sale, see the discussion below. Other Future Considerations Sunbury Generation Plant As a result of both market conditions and issues related to the physical performance of the plant, the Sunbury generation plant has not met our projected near term financial performance levels. Market conditions continue to be depressed due to low prices for capacity. Sunbury also incurred significant outage time during 2003 to maintain and repair fuel handling and recently installed environmental control equipment that experienced accelerated wear from the use of low grade fuel in some of the units. Operational issues related to Sunbury have been resolved or a plan has been put in place to resolve them. WPS Resources made capital contributions of $18.5 million to Sunbury in 2003 to compensate for the impact of decreased capacity revenues, as well as adjustments to Sunburys operating plan. For 2004, WPS Resources Board of Directors has granted authorization to contribute up to $24.5 million of capital to Sunbury. These funds will be used to cover operating losses, make principal and interest payments, and purchase emission allowances. On October 24, 2003, WPS Power Development entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Sunbury generation plant to a subsidiary of Duquesne Light Holdings for approximately $120 million, subject to certain working capital adjustments and regulatory approval. See Note 4 in Notes to WPS Resources Consolidated Financial Statements, Assets Held for Sale, for more information. Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant On November 7, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service and Wisconsin Power and Light Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Kewaunee nuclear power plant to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc. Wisconsin Public Service is a 59% owner of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. The transaction is subject to approval from various regulatory agencies, including the Public Service Commission of 77 &lt;PAGE&gt; Wisconsin, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and several other state utility regulatory agencies and is projected to close in 2004. Approval has already been obtained from the Iowa Public Utility Commission. Wisconsin Public Service estimates that its share of the cash proceeds from the sale will approximate $130 million, subject to various post closing adjustments. The cash proceeds from the sale are expected to slightly exceed the carrying value of the Wisconsin Public Service assets being sold. In addition to the cash proceeds, Wisconsin Public Service will retain ownership of the assets contained in its non qualified decommissioning trust, one of two funds that were established to cover the eventual decommissioning of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. The pretax fair value of the non qualified decommissioning trusts assets at December 31, 2003 was $115.1 million. Dominion will assume responsibility for the eventual decommissioning of Kewaunee and will receive Wisconsin Public Services qualified decommissioning trust assets that had a fair value of $239.7 million at December 31, 2003. Wisconsin Public Service will request deferral of the gain expected to result from this transaction and related costs from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Accordingly, the gain on the sale of the plant assets and the related non qualified decommissioning trust assets is expected to be returned to customers under future rate orders. Regulatory Wisconsin Effective March 21, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service received approval to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates $21.4 million (3.5%) and decrease Wisconsin retail natural gas rates $1.2 million (0.3%). The 2003 electric and retail natural gas rates reflect a 12.0% return on equity and allowed average equity of 55% in the utilitys capital structure. On April 1, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service filed an application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for authorization to increase retail electric rates and retail natural gas rates, effective January 1, 2004. The rate increases are necessary to recover the costs associated with the purchase of the De Pere Energy Center, fuel costs, maintenance of power production facilities, and employee benefits. On December 19, 2003, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued a final written order authorizing a retail electric rate increase of $59.4 million (9.4%) and a retail natural gas rate increase of $8.9 million (2.2%), effective January 1, 2004. The 2004 rates reflect a 12.0% return on equity. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin also approved average equity of 56% in the utilitys capital structure. The amount of fuel and purchased power costs Wisconsin Public Service is authorized to recover in rates is established in its general rate filings. If the actual fuel and purchased power costs vary from the authorized level by more than 2% on an annual basis, Wisconsin Public Service is allowed, or may be required, to file an application adjusting rates for the remainder of the year to reflect actual costs for the year to date and updated projected costs. On October 29, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service filed to reduce rates by $1.9 million, due to a reduction in the costs of fuel and purchased power, for the period August 15, 2003 through December 31, 2003. On February 19, 2004, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved a refund of $2.7 million, which represents the originally filed amounts, adjustments, and interest. This refund is expected to be credited to customer accounts in March 2004. A liability of $2.6 million was accrued as of December 31, 2003 in anticipation of this refund. As a result of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant unplanned outage in late January and early February 2004 and other fuel cost increases in 2004, Wisconsin Public Service filed for a fuel cost increase of $7.4 million on February 27, 2004. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has scheduled a hearing for March 22, 2004 to determine the amount of the fuel cost increase to be recovered on an interim basis. Wisconsin Public Service expects that a final order will be issued in summer 2004 regarding this rate increase request. 78 &lt;PAGE&gt; Michigan Wisconsin Public Service filed for an increase in electric rates in the first quarter of 2003. On July 21, 2003, the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized an increase in electric rates of $0.3 million and the recovery of an additional $1.0 million of transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery mechanism, effective July 22, 2003. On December 20, 2002, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved an 8.95% increase in retail electric rates for customers of Upper Peninsula Power. The Michigan Public Service Commission granted an 11.4% return on equity with the new rates being effective December 21, 2002. This was the first base rate increase for Upper Peninsula Power in 10 years. Michigan authorizes a one for one fuel and purchased power recovery mechanism for prudently incurred costs. Under the mechanism, the difference between actual and authorized fuel and purchased power costs is deferred until year end. By March 31 of the following year, the utility must file a reconciliation of the actual costs to the authorized costs. Any under or over recovery is then recovered from rates or returned to the ratepayer through the end of the following year. The reconciliation is subject to review and intervention by customers. At December 31, 2003 Upper Peninsula Power had significantly under recovered fuel and purchased power costs due to the high costs of purchased power. Upper Peninsula Power intends to file, in March 2004, a reconciliation of the 2003 purchased power costs requesting recovery of $5.2 million. In addition, costs associated with the Presque Isle Power Plant outage have been deferred and are expected to be addressed along with other Dead River flood issues in the next rate case. Upper Peninsula Power expects a final decision regarding the recovery of the 2003 fuel costs no later than the end of 2004. Due to the level of the under recovery relative to Upper Peninsula Powers revenues, the deferred cost may be recovered over more than one year. Federal On April 30, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service received a draft order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approving a 21%, or $4.1 million, interim increase in wholesale electric rates. The new wholesale rates were effective on May 11, 2003, and are subject to refund if the final rate increase is less. The draft order also granted the use of formula rates, which allow for the adjustment of wholesale electric rates to reflect actual costs without having to file additional rate requests. On March 4, 2004, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Wisconsin Public Service reached a tentative settlement regarding the final rate increase. Wisconsin Public Service anticipates no material refunds or other adjustments to revenues recorded under the interim rates based on the terms of the tentative agreement. The final settlement is anticipated to be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the second quarter of 2004. This is Wisconsin Public Services first rate increase for its wholesale electric customers in 17 years. Asset Management Strategy In 2001, WPS Resources initiated an asset management strategy, whereby assets, or business units, no longer required for operations would be disposed over the next 5 to 7 years in a manner that allows recognition of profits and provides capital for redeployment into new opportunities. In conjunction with the execution of a part of this strategy, the company has identified certain assets to be disposed of consisting primarily of land and some buildings, the sale of which is expected to provide basic earnings per share between $0.15 and $0.25, annually, through 2007. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS WPS RESOURCES As part of normal business, WPS Resources and its subsidiaries enter into various guarantees providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes. 79 &lt;PAGE&gt; The guarantees issued by WPS Resources include intercompany guarantees between parents and their subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation, and guarantees of the subsidiaries own performance. As such, these guarantees are excluded from the recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, outstanding guarantees totaled $981.8 million and $652.2 million, respectively, as follows: WPS Resources Outstanding Guarantees (Millions) December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Guarantees of subsidiary debt $ 39.7 $ 38.8 Guarantees supporting commodity transactions of subsidiaries 874.4 584.3 Standby letters of credit 61.1 22.7 Surety bonds 1.1 6.4 Other guarantee 5.5 Total guarantees $981.8 $652.2 WPS Resources Outstanding Guarantees (Millions) Commitments Expiring Total Amounts Committed At December 31, 2003 Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years Over 5 years Guarantees of subsidiary debt $ 39.7 $ 12.5 $ $ $ 27.2 Guarantees supporting commodity transactions of subsidiaries 874.4 769.3 83.4 21.2 0.5 Standby letters of credit 61.1 53.4 7.7 Surety bonds 1.1 1.1 Other guarantee 5.5 5.5 Total guarantees $981.8 $836.3 $91.1 $21.2 $33.2 At December 31, 2003, WPS Resources had outstanding $39.7 million in corporate guarantees supporting indebtedness. Of that total, $39.5 million supports outstanding debt at two of WPS Power Developments subsidiaries. The underlying debt related to these guarantees is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. WPS Resources Board of Directors has authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to $1.2 billion to support the business operations of WPS Energy Services. WPS Resources primarily issues the guarantees to counterparties in the wholesale electric and natural gas marketplace to provide counterparties the assurance that WPS Energy Services will perform on its obligations and permit WPS Energy Services to operate within these markets. The amount of guarantees actually issued by WPS Resources to support the business operations at WPS Energy Services at December 31, 2003 was $840.2 million and this is reflected in the table above. The amount actually supported is dependent on the amount of outstanding business WPS Energy Services has with the counterparties holding the guarantees at any point in time. WPS Resources reflects WPS Energy Services obligations supported by these parental guarantees on its consolidated balance sheet either as accounts payable or liabilities from risk management activities. At December 31, 2003, WPS Resources had issued $34.1 million in corporate guarantees to support the business operation of WPS Power Development, which are reflected in the above table. WPS Resources 80 &lt;PAGE&gt; issues the guarantees for indemnification obligations related to business purchase agreements and counterparties in the wholesale electric marketplace to meet their credit requirements and permit WPS Power Development to operate within these markets. The amount supported is dependent on the amount of the outstanding obligation that WPS Power Development has with the parties holding the guarantees at any point in time. WPS Resources reflects WPS Power Developments obligations supported by these parental guarantees on its consolidated balance sheet as either accounts payable or other liabilities. In February 2004, WPS Resources Board of Directors authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to $30.0 million to support business operations at WPS Power Development in addition to guarantees that have received specific authorizations. Another $0.1 million of corporate guarantees support energy supply at Upper Peninsula Power and are not reflected on WPS Resources consolidated balance sheet. In February 2004, WPS Resources Board of Directors authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to $15 million to support the business operations of Upper Peninsula Power. Corporate guarantees issued in the future under the Board authorized limit may or may not be reflected on WPS Resources consolidated balance sheet, depending on the nature of the guarantee. At WPS Resources request, financial institutions have issued $61.1 million in standby letters of credit for the benefit of third parties that have extended credit to certain subsidiaries. If a subsidiary does not pay amounts when due under a covered contract, the counterparty may present its claim for payment to the financial institution, which will request payment from WPS Resources. Any amounts owed by our subsidiaries are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2003, WPS Resources furnished $1.1 million of surety bonds for various reasons including worker compensation coverage and obtaining various licenses, permits, and rights of way. Liabilities incurred as a result of activities covered by surety bonds are included in the consolidated balance sheet. Other guarantee of $5.5 million listed on the above table was issued by Wisconsin Public Service to indemnify a third party for exposures related to the construction of utility assets. This amount is not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. WPS Resources has not identified any material variable interest entities created, or interests in variable entities obtained, after January 31, 2003 that require consolidation or disclosure under the Financial Accounting Standard Boards revised Interpretation No. 46 ("46R"), and we continue to assess the existence of any interests in variable interest entities, not classified as special purpose entities, created on or prior to January 31, 2003. The application of Interpretation No. 46R was required for interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. WPSR Capital Trust I was deconsolidated from the Consolidated Financial Statements of WPS Resources at December 31, 2003, as required by the provisions of Interpretation No. 46R related to special purpose entities. As a result of the deconsolidation, WPS Resources recorded a $1.5 million investment in the Trust within other current assets and a $51.5 million note payable to preferred stock trust, respectively, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 15 of WPS Resources Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the deconsolidation of WPSR Capital Trust I. WPS Resources currently anticipates that we will disclose information about a variable interest entity upon implementation of Interpretation No. 46R in the first quarter of 2004. Through an affiliate of WPS Power Development, Inc., WPS Resources owns a partial interest in a synthetic fuel production facility located in Kentucky and receives tax credits pursuant to Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code based on sales to unaffiliated third party purchasers of synthetic fuel produced from coal. At December 31, 2003, WPS Resources had a 23% ownership interest in the synthetic fuel facility. Section 29 tax credits generated by the facility are currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2007. WPS Resources maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this potential variable interest entity is limited to our investment in the entity, which is not significant at December 31, 2003. Currently, we do not believe that WPS Resources is the primary beneficiary of this entity and do not 81 &lt;PAGE&gt; anticipate consolidation of the synthetic fuel facility upon adoption of Interpretation No. 46R in the first quarter of 2004. TRADING ACTIVITIES WPS RESOURCES WPS Energy Services measures the fair value of contracts, including NYMEX exchange and over the counter contracts, natural gas options, natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts, basis contracts, and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis using risk management systems. The primary input for natural gas pricing is the settled forward price curve of the NYMEX exchange, which includes contracts and options. Basis pricing is derived from published indices and documented broker quotes. WPS Energy Services bases electric prices on published indices and documented broker quotes. The following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of WPS Energy Services assets and liabilities from risk management activities during the 12 months ended December 31, 2003. WPS Energy Services, Inc. Mark to Market Roll Forward (Millions) Natural Gas Electric Total Fair value of contracts at January 1, 2003 $(7.1) $11.0 $ 3.9 Less contracts realized or settled during period (15.0) (2.1) (17.1) Plus fair value of new contracts entered into during period 9.3 1.6 10.9 Other changes in fair value 16.4 16.4 Cumulative effect of rescission of Issue No. 98 10 9.7 (4.2) 5.5 Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2003 $13.3 $ 6.3 $ 19.6 The fair value of contracts at January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2003 reflect the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates. Contracts realized or settled during the period include the value of contracts in existence at January 1, 2003 that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of December 31, 2003 and the amortization of those derivatives designated as normal purchases and sales under Statement No. 133. Mark to market gains and losses related to contracts that were entered into subsequent to January 1, 2003, that are still included in WPS Energy Services portfolio at December 31, 2003, are included in the fair value of new contracts entered into during the period. There were, in many cases, offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period. The realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above. The "Other changes in fair value" line in the table primarily represents the reversal of the change in the fair value of gas storage contracts as of January 1, 2003. With the rescission of Issue No. 98 10, natural gas storage contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis and are no longer adjusted to fair value. The cumulative effect of rescission of Issue No. 98 10 is the reversal of the December 31, 2002 risk management assets and liabilities that no longer qualify for mark to market accounting with the rescission of Issue No. 98 10 as required by Issue No. 02 03. 82 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Energy Services, Inc. Derivative Contract Aging at Fair Value As of December 31, 2003 Source of Fair Value (Millions) Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1 to 3 years Maturity 4 to 5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total fair value Prices actively quoted $6.0 $(0.1) $ 5.9 Prices provided by external sources 4.3 5.5 9.8 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 1.2 2.7 3.9 Total fair value $11.5 $ 8.1 $19.6 "Prices actively quoted" includes NYMEX contracts. "Prices provided by external sources" includes basis swaps and over the counter contracts. "Prices based on models and other valuation methods" includes some retail natural gas and electric contracts due to the volume optionality that exists in those contracts. We derive the pricing for all contracts in the above table from active quotes or external sources. Pricing is the most significant variable in the mark to market calculations. WPS Energy Services, as a result of WPS Power Developments acquisition of generating assets in New York, has acquired transmission congestion contracts, which are financial contracts, that hedge price risk between zones within the New York Independent System Operator. The contracts were marked to fair value using a combination of modeled forward prices and market quotes. The fair market value of the contracts at December 31, 2003 was $1.3 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES WPS RESOURCES In May 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued proposed rules regarding the identification and disclosure of accounting estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies and the disclosure of initial adoption by a company of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial presentation. Under the first part of the proposal, a company would have to identify the accounting estimates reflected in its financial statements that required it to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Disclosures about those estimates would then be required if different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of the companys financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The Securities and Exchange Commission accepted comments on the proposed rules through July 19, 2002 and has not made any final decisions since that time. In anticipation of at least parts of this proposed rule being made final, we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. Risk Management Activities WPS Resources has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. At December 31, 2003, those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts to manage price risk associated with wholesale and retail natural gas purchase and sale activities and electric energy contracts. Managements expectations and intentions are key factors in determining the appropriate accounting for a derivative transaction, and as a result, such expectations and intentions are documented. Cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when WPS Resources contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases. Fair value hedge accounting may be used when WPS Resources holds firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity may change between the contracts inception and the physical delivery date of the 83 &lt;PAGE&gt; commodity. To the extent that the fair value of a hedge instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged, there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge. In addition, WPS Resources may apply the normal purchases and normal sales exemption, provided by Statement No. 133, as amended, to certain contracts. The normal purchases and sales exception provides that no recognition of the contracts fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until the settlement of the contract. Derivatives contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of Statement No. 133, as amended, are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of WPS Resources. Changes in fair value, except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, are generally included in the determination of income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled. When available, quoted market prices are used to record a contracts fair value. If no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contracts duration, fair value is estimated through the use of internally developed valuation techniques or models. Such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by WPS Resources management. As a component of the fair value determination, WPS Resources maintains reserves to account for the estimated costs of servicing and holding certain of its contracts based upon administrative costs, credit/counterparty risk, and servicing margin with both fixed and variable components. The effect of changing both the administrative costs and credit/counterparty risk assumptions is as follows: Change in Assumption (Millions) Effect to Operating Reserve at December 31, 2003 100% increase $1.6 50% decrease $(0.8) These potential changes to the operating reserve would be shown as part of the Nonregulated cost of fuel, gas and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Assets/Liabilities from risk management activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Asset Impairment WPS Resources annually reviews its assets for impairment. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets," and Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," are the basis for these analyses. The review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to WPS Power Development than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property, plant, and equipment and lack of access to regulatory relief that is available to our regulated segments. We believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing, production costs, and generation volumes and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet and the net loss on our income statement could be material. Managements assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual market sales prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs, environmental changes, and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The primary estimates used at WPS Power Development in this process are future revenue streams and operating costs. A combination of input from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams. WPS Power Developments operations group projects future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices. These estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in Statement No. 144. WPS Power Development evaluates property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Statement 144 requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a companys asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be 84 &lt;PAGE&gt; recognized in the financial statements. The amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. Throughout 2003, WPS Power Development tested power plants for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment charges were recorded in 2003 as a result of these recoverability tests. The merger of Wisconsin Fuel and Light into Wisconsin Public Service in 2001 resulted in Wisconsin Public Service recording goodwill related to its gas utility segment. The goodwill is tested for impairment yearly based on the guidance of Statement No. 142. The test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between our gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments. A significant change in the gas utility market and or our projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset, as a result of the impairment test. Receivables and Reserves Our regulated gas and electric utilities and WPS Energy Services accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed. Estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, and weather factors. The estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations. Any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue. WPS Resources reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet. Wisconsin Public Service records a regulatory asset to offset its uncollectible reserve. Due to the nature of the nonregulated energy marketing business having higher credit risk, the reserve is more critical to WPS Energy Services than to our other segments. At WPS Energy Services, the reserve is based on historical uncollectible experience and specific customer identification where practical. If the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect, or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults, there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance. Pension and Postretirement Benefits The costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs, for example, are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions we make to the plan, and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. Other postretirement benefit costs, for example, are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age and compensation levels), the level of contributions we make to the plans, earnings on plan assets, and health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future other postretirement benefit costs. Other postretirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates, and the discount rates used in determining the postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement costs. WPS Resources pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes 85 &lt;PAGE&gt; in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs. Changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates, health care cost trend rates, and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded other postretirement benefit costs. Management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process. The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. The chart below reflects an increase or decrease in the percentage for each assumption, and how each change would impact the projected benefit obligation, our net amount recognized on the balance sheet, and our reported annual pension cost on the income statement as they relate to our two large qualified pension plans. Each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percent Change in Assumption Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation Impact on Net Amount Recognized Impact on Pension Cost Discount rate (0.5) $34.0 $(0.6) $ 0.6 Discount rate 0.5 (37.6) 0.7 (0.7) Rate of return on plan assets (0.5) N/A (2.7) 2.7 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A 2.7 (2.7) The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. The chart below reflects an increase or decrease in the percentage for each assumption and how each change would impact the projected other postretirement benefit obligation, our reported other postretirement benefit liability on the balance sheet, and our reported annual other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. Each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percent Change in Assumption Impact on Postretirement Benefit Obligation Impact on Postretirement Benefit Liability Impact on Postretirement Benefit Cost Discount rate (0.5) $21.6 $2.5 $2.5 Discount rate 0.5 (20.0) (1.8) (1.8) Health care cost trend rate (1.0) (37.4) (5.6) (5.6) Health care cost trend rate 1.0 48.6 6.3 6.3 Rate of return on plan assets (0.5) N/A 0.6 0.6 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (0.6) (0.6) In selecting an assumed discount rate, we consider long term Corporate Aa rated bond yield rates. In selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets, we consider the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target allocation of the benefit trust portfolios. The fair value of pension plan assets increased $92.7 million in 2003, decreased $47.8 million in 2002, and decreased $13.7 million in 2001. As further described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a result of the declining interest rate environment, we were required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by Statement No. 87. The liability was recorded as an intangible asset, a regulatory asset, and a reduction to common equity through a charge to Other comprehensive income. The charge to Other comprehensive income could be restored through common equity in future periods to the extent fair value of trust assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation. Also, pension cost and cash funding requirements could increase in future years without continued improved asset returns. 86 &lt;PAGE&gt; The fair value of other postretirement benefit plan assets increased $23.7 million in 2003, decreased $14.8 million in 2002, and decreased $4.4 million in 2001. In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs. WPS Resources adjusted its health care cost trend rates upwards each of the last two years in an attempt to keep our health care cost trend rates in line with the rapidly increasing health care costs the country and WPS Resources have faced. Also, other postretirement benefit cost and cash funding could increase in future years without continued improved asset returns. Regulatory Accounting The electric and gas utility segments of WPS Resources follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments. We defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, but are generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Once approved, we reduce regulatory assets and liabilities by recognition in income over the rate recovery period. If not approved, these regulatory assets or liabilities would be recognized in income in the then current period. If our electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for applying Statement No. 71, we would discontinue its application as defined under Statement No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." Assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation may no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurs. A write off of all WPS Resources regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2003 would result in a 3.0% decrease in total assets, a 9.4% decrease in total liabilities, and a 122.5% increase in Income before taxes. Tax Provision As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provisions in the statements of operations. 87 &lt;PAGE&gt; RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WPS RESOURCES WPS Resources has investments in related parties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These include the investment at WPS Investment, LLC, (a consolidated subsidiary of WPS Resources), in American Transmission Company, LLC and Guardian Pipeline, LLC, Wisconsin Public Services investment in Wisconsin River Power Company, WPS Resources investment in WPSR Capital Trust I, and WPS Nuclear Corporations (a consolidated subsidiary of WPS Resources) investment in Nuclear Management Company. American Transmission Company, LLC is a for profit, transmission only company that owns, plans, maintains, monitors, and operates electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois. At December 31, 2003, WPS Investments ownership in American Transmission Company was 19.8%. Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power recorded related party transactions for services provided to and network transmission services received from American Transmission Company during 2003, 2002, and 2001. Charges to American Transmission Company for services provided by Wisconsin Public Service were $14.4 million, $12.9 million, and $11.3 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Upper Peninsula Power charged $7.6 million, $5.8 million, and $2.7 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, for services provided. Network transmission costs paid to American Transmission Company by Wisconsin Public Service were $33.6 million, $31.0 million, and $25.2 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Upper Peninsula Power recorded network transmission costs of $4.4 million, $5.0 million, and $3.3 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Guardian Pipeline, LLC owns a natural gas pipeline, which began operating in 2002, that stretches about 140 miles from near Joliet, Illinois into southern Wisconsin. WPS Investments, LLC purchased its 33% interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC on May 30, 2003. Wisconsin River Power Company, of which Wisconsin Public Service owns 50% of the voting stock, operates an oil fired combustion turbine and two hydroelectric plants on the Wisconsin River. The energy output from the hydroelectric plants is sold in equal parts to the three companies that previously owned equal portions of all the outstanding stock of Wisconsin River Power (Wisconsin Public Service, Wisconsin Power and Light, and Consolidated Water Power). The electric power from the combustion turbine is sold in equal parts to Wisconsin Public Service and Wisconsin Power and Light. Wisconsin Public Service recorded related party transactions for service provided to and purchases from Wisconsin River Power during 2003, 2002, and 2001. Revenues from service provided to Wisconsin River Power were $1.4 million, $1.5 million, and $0.9 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Purchases from Wisconsin River Power by Wisconsin Public Service were $2.0 million, $2.1 million, and $1.7 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. WPSR Capital Trust I was deconsolidated from the Consolidated Financial Statements of WPS Resources at December 31, 2003, as required by the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Boards revised Interpretation No. 46 ("46R") related to special purpose entities. Refer to Note 15 of WPS Resources Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the deconsolidation of WPSR Capital Trust I. As a result of the deconsolidation, WPS Resources recorded a $1.5 million investment in the Trust within other current assets and a $51.5 million note payable to preferred stock trust, a related party, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. Prior periods have not been restated per the transition provisions of Interpretation No. 46R. The Trust remains consolidated within the December 31, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet and the interest payments on the debentures are reflected within interest expense and distributions on trust preferred securities on the Consolidated Statements of Income for all years presented. On January 8, 2004, we redeemed all of the subordinated debentures that were initially issued to the Trust for $51.5 million and paid accrued interest of $0.1 million. This action required the Trust to redeem an equal amount of trust securities at face value plus any accrued interest and unpaid distributions. As a result of these transactions, the Trust has been dissolved effective January 8, 2004. 88 &lt;PAGE&gt; The Nuclear Management Company is owned by affiliates of five utilities in the upper Midwest and operates the six nuclear power plants of these utilities. At December 31, 2003 WPS Nuclear Corporations ownership in Nuclear Management Company was 20%. Wisconsin Public Service recorded related party transactions for services provided by Nuclear Management Company for the management and operation of the Kewaunee nuclear plant. Management service fees paid to Nuclear Management Company by Wisconsin Public Service were $25.2 million, $24.6 million, and $16.4 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Management service fees paid to Nuclear Management Company in 2003 and 2002 reflect a 17.8% increase in Wisconsin Public Services ownership of the Kewaunee plant after acquiring Madison Gas and Electric Companys ownership in the Kewaunee plant on September 24, 2001. TRENDS WPS RESOURCES Environmental WPS Resources and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state, and local regulations regarding environmental impacts of their operations on air and water quality and solid waste. The application of federal and state restrictions to protect the environment can involve review, certification, or issuance of permits by various federal and state authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the various states environmental agencies, including the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. These restrictions may limit, prevent, or substantially increase the cost of the operation of generation facilities and may require substantial investments in new equipment at existing installations. Such restrictions may require substantial additional investments for new projects and may delay or prevent completion of projects. We cannot forecast the effects of such regulation on our generation, transmission, and other facilities or operations. WPS Power Development is subject to regulation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and environmental regulation in Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin with respect to thermal and other discharges from its power plants. New legislation could negatively impact future cash flows and impact WPS Power Developments ability to compete with regulated utilities, which are allowed recovery of these costs. WPS Energy Services is not directly subject to significant environmental regulations at this time. Wisconsin Public Service continues to investigate the environmental cleanup of ten manufactured gas plant sites, two of which were previously owned by Wisconsin Fuel and Light. As of the fall of 2003, cleanup of the land portion at five sites was substantially complete. Groundwater treatment and monitoring at these sites will continue into the future. River sediment remains to be addressed at six sites with sediment contamination. Wisconsin Public Service estimates remaining future undiscounted investigation and cleanup costs for all remaining site work to be $36.2 million to $40.6 million and recorded a $36.2 million liability for gas plant cleanup with an offsetting regulatory asset at December 31, 2003. Wisconsin Public Service expects to recover cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries in future customer rates. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated southeastern Wisconsin as an ozone non attainment area. Under the Clean Air Act, the State of Wisconsin developed a nitrogen oxide reduction plan for Wisconsins ozone non attainment area. The nitrogen oxide reductions began in 2003 and will gradually increase through 2007. Wisconsin Public Service owns 31.8% of Edgewater Unit 4, which is located in the ozone non attainment area. A compliance plan for this unit was initiated in 2000. Wisconsin Public Services share of the costs of this project is expected to be approximately $5 million. The project is nearly complete. Wisconsin Public Service has incurred approximately $4.9 million on this project as of December 31, 2003. The State of Wisconsin is also seeking voluntary reductions from utility units outside the ozone non attainment area, which may lead to additional expenditures for nitrogen oxide reductions at other units. Wisconsin Public Service is participating in voluntary efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide levels at the 89 &lt;PAGE&gt; Columbia Energy Center. Wisconsin Public Service owns 31.8% of the Columbia facility. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has approved recovery of the costs associated with voluntary nitrogen oxide reductions. Air quality modeling by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources revealed that Weston Units 1 and 2 contribute to a modeled exceedance of the sulfur dioxide ambient air quality standard. Wisconsin Public Service expects that compliance with a future limit can be achieved by managing the coal supply quality. Wisconsin Public Service is cooperating with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to develop an approach to resolve this issue. In November 1999, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced the commencement of a Clean Air Act enforcement initiative targeting the utility industry. This initiative resulted in the issuance of several notices of violation/findings of violation and the filing of lawsuits against other unaffiliated utilities. In these enforcement proceedings, the United States Environmental Protection Agency claims that the utilities made modifications to the coal fired boilers and related equipment at the utilities electric generating stations without first obtaining appropriate permits under the United States Environmental Protection Agencys pre construction permit program and without installing appropriate air pollution control equipment. In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency is claiming, in certain situations, that there were violations of the Clean Air Acts "new source performance standards." In the matters where actions have been commenced, the federal government is seeking penalties and the installation of pollution control equipment. If the federal government decided to bring a claim against Wisconsin Public Service and if it were determined by a court that historic projects at the Pulliam and Weston electric generating stations required either a state or federal Clean Air Act permit, Wisconsin Public Service may, under the applicable statutes, be required to: shut down any unit found to be operating in non compliance, install additional pollution control equipment, pay a fine, and or pay a fine and conduct a supplemental environmental project in order to resolve any such claim. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources initiated a rulemaking effort to control mercury emissions. Coal fired generation plants are the primary targets of this effort. The proposed rule was open to comment in October 2001. As proposed, the rule requires phased in mercury emission reductions reaching 90% reduction in 15 years. Wisconsin Public Service estimates that it could cost approximately $163 million to achieve the proposed 90% reductions. Presently, the proposed rule is on hold, and it is uncertain if the state will proceed to finalize the regulations. In December 2003, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed mercury "maximum achievable control technology" standards and an alternative mercury "cap and trade" program substantially modeled on the Clear Skies legislation initiative. In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed the Interstate Air Quality rule, which would reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from utility boilers located in 29 states, including Wisconsin. Wisconsin Public Service is in the process of studying the proposed rules. As to the mercury "maximum achievable control technology" proposal, it requires existing units burning sub bituminous coal to achieve an annual average mercury emission rate limit of 5.8 pounds per trillion Btu on a unit by unit or plant wide basis. New units must achieve an emission rate limit of 0.020 pounds per gigawatt hour. If the proposed rule is promulgated, Wisconsin Public Services current analysis indicates that the emission control equipment on the existing units may be sufficient to achieve the proposed limitation. New units will require additional mercury control techniques to reduce mercury emissions by 65% to 85%. Mercury control technology is still in development. Wisconsin Public Service is assessing potential mercury control technologies for application to future new coal fired units. The Interstate Air Quality rule proposal allows the affected states (including Wisconsin) to either require utilities located in the state to participate in an interstate cap and trade program or meet the states 90 &lt;PAGE&gt; emission budget for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide through measures to be determined by the state. Wisconsin has not stated a preference as to which option it would select in the event the rule becomes final. While the effect of the rule on Wisconsin Public Services facilities is uncertain for planning purposes, it is assumed that additional nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide controls will be needed on existing units or the existing units will need to be converted to natural gas by 2010. The installation of any controls and or any conversion to natural gas will need to be scheduled as part of Wisconsin Public Services long term maintenance plan for its existing units. As such, controls or conversions may need to take place before the proposed 2010 compliance date. On a preliminary basis and assuming controls or conversion is required, Wisconsin Public Service estimates a cost of $288 million in order to meet a 2010 compliance date. This estimate is based on costs of current control technology. The generation assets of WPS Power Development are subject to regulations on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions similar to those that apply to Wisconsin Public Service. In addition, the Sunbury generation facilities of WPS Power Development are located in an ozone transport region. As a result, these generation facilities are subject to additional restrictions on emissions of nitrogen oxide. Although WPS Power Development has some emission allowances for 2004 for the Sunbury facility, it may need to purchase approximately 10,000 to 15,000 additional allowances at market rates, to meet its 2004 requirements. Energy and Capacity Prices Prices for electric energy and capacity have been extremely volatile over the past three years. WPS Resources nonregulated entities are impacted by this volatility, which has been driven by the exit of many of the largest speculative traders, the slow down in the economy, and significant overbuilding of generation capacity. Although electric energy prices are currently high due to increased natural gas prices, we expect that electric capacity prices will continue to be depressed for several years. Pressure on capacity prices will continue until existing reserve margins are depleted either by load growth or capacity retirements. WPS Power Development has been negatively impacted by the depressed capacity prices and volatile energy prices discussed above, and as a result we have taken certain steps to reduce our exposure to the merchant marketplace. On October 23, 2003, a definitive agreement was signed to sell WPS Power Developments Sunbury generating facility to a subsidiary of Duquesne Light Holdings. The pending sale will allow us to reduce uncontracted merchant exposure and redeploy capital into markets with different risk profiles. In addition, in January 2004, WPS Power Development entered into an agreement to lease most of its generation relating to continuing operations to WPS Energy Services. WPS Energy Services will utilize various financial tools, including forwards and options, to limit exposure and extract additional value from volatile commodity prices. Synthetic Fuel Operation We have significantly reduced our consolidated federal income tax liability for the past four years through tax credits available to us under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel from coal. In order to maximize the value of our synthetic fuel production facility, we have reduced our interest in the facility from 67% to 23% through sales to third parties (see Note 6, Acquisitions and Sales of Assets). Our ability to fully utilize the Section 29 tax credits that remain available to us in connection with our remaining interest in the facility will depend on whether the amount of our federal income tax liability is sufficient to permit the use of such credits. The Internal Revenue Service strictly enforces compliance with all of the technical requirements of Section 29. Section 29 tax credits are currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2007. On June 27, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it had reason to question the scientific validity of certain test procedures and results that have been presented by certain taxpayers to qualify for Section 29 credits. The Internal Revenue Service also announced that it was reviewing information 91 &lt;PAGE&gt; regarding these test procedures and practices. However, on October 29, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it had closed its investigation and concluded that such tests and procedures were scientifically valid if properly applied and indicated it would issue additional guidance on future sampling and testing. WPS Resources believes that its synthetic fuel facility does and will comply with such guidelines. As a result of the June 2003 Internal Revenue Service announcement, on August 1, 2003, WPS Resources received notice from the Internal Revenue Service that the WPS Resources affiliate through which it holds an ownership interest in a synthetic fuel facility was under review for the 2001 tax period and that, depending upon the review of the affiliates 2001 tax return, the Internal Revenue Service might reexamine the affiliates 2000 tax return. However, following the October announcement that the Internal Revenue Service was closing its investigation, WPS Resources received preliminary notice in January 2004 that both audits related to this issue have closed without adjustment. Future years remain open to audit. We continue to believe that the facility has been operated in compliance with the requirements of Section 29. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs has been conducting an investigation of the synthetic fuel industry and their use of Section 29 tax credits. Pursuant to its invitation, on January 30, 2004, we answered questions of the Committee regarding our synthetic fuel facility. It is not known when the investigation will be completed and what impact, if any, such investigation may have on future legislation or the enforcement policy of the Internal Revenue Service. We have recorded approximately $81.3 million of Section 29 tax credits as reductions of income tax expense from the projects inception in June 1998 through December 31, 2003. As a result of alternative minimum tax rules, about $52.3 million of this tax benefit has been carried forward as a deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2003. Future payments under one of the agreements covering the sale of a portion of our interest in the facility are contingent on the facilitys continued production of synthetic fuel. Any disallowance of some or all of those tax credits would materially affect the related deferred tax account, as well as future tax obligations. Additionally, such disallowances may also result in a reduction of the level of synthetic fuel production at the facility, thus reducing the likelihood and amount of future payments under that agreement. Future tax legislation and Internal Revenue Service review may also affect the value of the credits and the value of our share of the facility. Industry Restructuring To the extent competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more of the characteristics of a commodity business, the economics of our business may come under increasing pressure. In addition, regulatory changes may increase access to electric transmission grids by utility and nonutility purchasers and sellers of electricity, thus potentially resulting in a significant number of additional competitors in wholesale power generation. Deregulation of the electric and natural gas utilities has begun in Wisconsin, particularly for natural gas service. Currently, the largest natural gas customers can purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility. Efforts are underway to make it easier for smaller natural gas customers to do the same. In addition, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has been studying how to deregulate the states electric supply. We believe electric deregulation inside Wisconsin is at least several years off as the state is focused on improving reliability by building more generation and transmission facilities and creating fair market rules. As electric choice occurs, we believe we will lose some generation load, which could negatively impact future cash flows, but will retain the delivery revenues and margin. Also, the capacity that is freed up should be competitive in our marketplace. Deregulation of electricity is present in Michigan; however, no customers have chosen an alternative electric supplier and no alternative electric suppliers have offered to serve any customers in Michigans Upper Peninsula due to the lack of transmission capacity in the areas we serve, which is a barrier to competitive suppliers entering the market. 92 &lt;PAGE&gt; In February 2004 the Michigan Public Service Commission issued an interim order providing electric rate relief to Detroit Edison in a manner that could negatively impact the competitive electric supply market in the area served by this utility. As a result of the interim order, customers of competitive electric suppliers will experience a decrease in cost savings compared to the bundled utility rate, potentially making electric choice less attractive to energy consumers. WPS Energy Services serves customers in the impacted area and therefore the interim order could negatively impact future electric revenues and margins at this business. We will work to obtain modifications to the interim order as the final rate order is not expected until September 2004. New Accounting Pronouncements Impact of Issue 02 03 on WPS Energy Services Revenues As required, on January 1, 2003, WPS Energy Services adopted Issue No. 02 03. Upon adoption, Issue 02 03 required revenues related to derivative instruments classified as trading to be reported net of related cost of sales for all periods presented. Prior to January 1, 2003, WPS Energy Services classified all its activities as trading in accordance with the accounting standards in effect at that time. Consistent with the new accounting standards under Issue 02 03, effective January 1, 2003, WPS Energy Services classifies as trading activities only those transactions that at inception are intended to be settled in the near term with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices. As a result of the change in the definition of trading, a larger portion of WPS Energy Services business activities were classified as trading in 2002 than in 2003. Therefore, previously reported revenues for 2002 and 2001 have been reclassified to be shown net of cost of fuel, natural gas, and purchased power, while most 2003 revenues continue to be reported on a gross basis. The retroactive reclassification to net revenues and cost of sales for 2002 and 2001 trading activities resulted in a $1,127.4 million and $1,243.7 million decrease to WPS Resources previously reported consolidated nonregulated revenues, respectively, and a corresponding $1,127.4 million and $1,243.7 million decrease to previously reported consolidated nonregulated cost of fuel, natural gas, and purchased power for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Neither margins, income, nor cash flows for 2002 were impacted by the reclassification of revenue upon adoption of Issue 02 03. Asset Retirement Obligations Effective January 1, 2003, WPS Resources adopted Statement No. 143. Under the new accounting standard, WPS Resources recognizes, at fair value, legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, or development and or normal operation of the asset. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and depreciated over their useful life. Legal retirement obligations identified for the regulated segments of WPS Resources relate primarily to the final decommissioning of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. The nonregulated segments identified a legal retirement obligation related to the closure of an ash basin located at the Sunbury generation plant. The adoption of Statement No. 143 had no impact on the earnings or cash flows of the regulated segment as the effects were offset by the establishment of regulatory assets and liabilities pursuant to Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and reduced earnings of the nonregulated segment by $0.3 million, recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Upon implementation of Statement No. 143 in the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a net asset retirement cost of $90.8 million (decreased to $78.5 million at December 31, 2003 due to depreciation being recorded) and an asset retirement obligation of $324.8 million upon adoption of Statement No. 143 (increased to $344.0 million at December 31, 2003 as a result of accretion being recorded). The difference between previously recorded liabilities of $290.5 million and the cumulative effect of adopting Statement No. 143 was deferred to a regulatory liability pursuant to Statement No. 71. Costs of Removal The utility segments of WPS Resources recognize removal costs for utility assets. Historically, these removal costs were reflected as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation in 93 &lt;PAGE&gt; accordance with regulatory treatment. The Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission recently expressed their views on the balance sheet classification of these costs of removal and required that the amounts be reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a liability. As a result, WPS Resources reclassified $463.3 million of removal costs from accumulated depreciation to nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal at December 31, 2002. WPS Resources identified legal retirement obligations associated with the removal of certain utility assets upon implementation of Statement No. 143 in January 2003. Upon the adoption of Statement No. 143 on January 1, 2003, costs of removal with associated legal obligations of $290.5 million were removed from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal as these costs are now accounted for as asset retirement obligations. Costs of removal that were not identified as having an associated legal retirement obligation were reclassified from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal to a regulatory liability at December 31, 2003. Income available for common shareholders and cash flows were not impacted by this accounting change. Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51," in order to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities. Interpretation No. 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. On December 24, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 ("46R") in order to clarify some of the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. The effective implementation date of Interpretation No. 46 was also modified by Interpretation No. 46R. The application of Interpretation No. 46R was required for financial statements of public entities that have interests in special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. WPS Resources identified WPSR Capital Trust I as a special purpose entity that is within the scope of Interpretation No. 46R. See Note 15, "Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Trust Preferred Securities of Preferred Stock Trust," for further discussion of the impacts of implementing this portion of Interpretation No. 46R on the financial statement of WPS Resources. For all other types of variable interest entities, the application of Interpretation No. 46R will be required in the first quarter of 2004. We do not anticipate a significant impact to the financial statements of WPS Resources in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of adopting the remaining provisions of Interpretation No. 46R. Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 In January 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board Issued Staff Position (FSP) 106 1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." FSP 106 1 permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law on December 8, 2003. Regardless of whether a sponsor elects that deferral, the FSP required certain disclosures pending further consideration of the underlying accounting issues. In accordance with FSP 106 1, we have elected to defer accounting for the effects of this legislation until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the legislation is issued. Refer to Note 19 of WPS Resources Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 94 &lt;PAGE&gt; IMPACT OF INFLATION WPS RESOURCES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and report operating results in terms of historic cost. The statements provide a reasonable, objective, and quantifiable statement of financial results; but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation. Under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions, Wisconsin Public Services and Upper Peninsula Powers projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues. Because rate forecasting assumes inflation, most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates. However, in these forecasts, Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation. 95 &lt;PAGE&gt; RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION Wisconsin Public Service Corporation is a regulated electric and natural gas utility as well as a holding company exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Electric operations accounted for approximately 64% of revenues in 2003, while gas operations contributed 36% to 2003 revenues. 2003 Compared with 2002 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation Overview Wisconsin Public Services 2003 and 2002 results of operations are shown in the following table: Wisconsin Public Services Results (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Operating revenues $1,129.1 $1,007.6 12% Earnings on common stock 78.9 83.1 (5%) Wisconsin retail electric and wholesale electric rate increases together with higher natural gas prices contributed to the increase in operating revenues in 2003. Earnings from electric utility operations were $53.6 million in 2003 compared with $58.6 million in 2002. Earnings from gas utility operations were $15.7 million in 2003 compared with $18.4 million in 2002. The decrease in electric earnings at Wisconsin Public Service was attributable to a delay in receiving 2003 retail electric rate relief, together with rising operating expenses (primarily pension and medical costs). Rate relief for these increasing operating costs was expected on January 1, 2003; however, the increase in retail electric rates granted by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin was not effective until March 21, 2003. The decrease in gas utility earnings is also due to rising operating expenses, together with a decrease in the natural gas rates allowed by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in 2003 compared to 2002. Electric Utility Operations Electric Utility Results (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Revenues $724.9 $696.9 4% Fuel and purchased power 225.0 217.2 4% Margins $499.9 $479.7 4% Sales in kilowatt hours 13,411.4 13,579.7 (1%) Electric utility revenues increased $28.0 million, or 4%, in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase is largely due to retail and wholesale electric rate increases for the Wisconsin and Michigan customers in accordance with new rate orders. Due primarily to the electric rate increases, electric margins at Wisconsin Public Service increased $20.2 million, or 4%, in 2003. Electric margins were also impacted favorably by a change in sales mix in 2003. While total sales volumes remained basically unchanged in 2003 compared to 2002, sales volumes to higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased slightly. The increase in sales volumes to these higher margin customer classes reflects growth within Wisconsin Public Services service area and recent changes in the economy. These increases were partially offset by cooler weather during the cooling season for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. 96 &lt;PAGE&gt; The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows Wisconsin Public Service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to Wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range. Wisconsin Public Service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus 2% from forecasted costs on an annualized basis. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Wisconsin Public Service, Other Future Considerations, Regulatory for information on fuel filings related to 2003. Gas Utility Operations Gas Utility Results (Millions) 2003 2002 Change Revenues $404.2 $310.7 30% Purchase costs 291.0 198.6 47% Margins $113.2 $112.1 1% Throughput in therms 854.5 845.4 1% Gas utility revenues increased $93.5 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in gas utility revenues is mostly due to a 39% increase in the average cost of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the prior year, partially offset by the 0.3% decrease in retail natural gas rates ordered by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, effective March 21, 2003. The natural gas utility margin for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $1.1 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in the natural gas utility margin can be attributed to a 1% increase in natural gas throughput volumes in 2003 compared to 2002. Natural gas throughput volumes to our higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased 6% in the aggregate, mostly as a result of colder weather in 2003 compared to 2002. Natural gas throughput volumes to our lower margin transport customers decreased 5% due to the rising price of natural gas together with their ability to use alternate fuel sources. Wisconsin Public Service passes changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause, as allowed by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Michigan Public Service Commission under current regulatory practice. Other Expenses/Income Utility operating and maintenance expense increased $28.2 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the prior year. Approximately $17 million of the increase reflects higher pension, postretirement medical and active medical costs. The remaining increase pertains to costs incurred for plant maintenance related to the Kewaunee nuclear power plants scheduled refueling outage in 2003 (there was no refueling outage in 2002), additional operating expenses at the Kewaunee nuclear power plant and wage increases. Utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased $41.0 million, or 50%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the prior year, mostly related to an increase of $37.4 million resulting from higher realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets that resulted in recording decommissioning expense approximately equal to the gains recognized in miscellaneous income pursuant to regulatory practice. The remaining increase is related to plant asset additions. Other utility income increased in 2003, largely due to an increase in realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets of $36.4 million. The realized gains were offset by increased decommissioning expense, as discussed above. 97 &lt;PAGE&gt; Other Nonutility Income Other nonutility income increased in 2003, largely due to an increase in gains recognized on hydroelectric land sales in 2003 compared to 2002 (primarily due to the $6.2 million pre tax gain recognized in 2003 from land sales to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources). Earnings from equity method investments also increased in 2003 compared to 2002. 2002 Compared with 2001 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation Overview Wisconsin Public Services 2002 and 2001 results of operations are shown in the following table: Wisconsin Public Services Results (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Operating revenues $1,007.6 $932.3 8% Earnings on common stock 83.1 80.6 3% Sales volume growth and Wisconsin retail rate increases contributed to increased revenues in 2002. Earnings from electric utility operations were $58.6 million in 2002 compared with $57.9 million in 2001. Earnings from gas utility operations were $18.4 million in 2002 compared with $8.9 million in 2001. A full year contribution from gas utility operations acquired in the spring of 2001, warmer than normal weather during the heating season in 2001, and a rate increase approved by regulators resulted in increased earnings from gas utility operations in 2002. Utility margins at Wisconsin Public Service were impacted positively by a Public Service Commission of Wisconsin interim rate order which was effective January 1, 2002 authorizing a 10.3% increase in Wisconsin retail electric rates and a 4.7% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates. In late June 2002, Wisconsin Public Service received a final 2002 rate order, which authorized a 10.9% increase in Wisconsin retail electric rates and a 3.9% increase in Wisconsin retail natural gas rates. The final order authorized a lower retail natural gas rate increase than was approved in the interim order resulting in a $0.4 million refund to Wisconsin Public Services natural gas customers. Electric Utility Operations Wisconsin Public Services electric utility margin increased $81.8 million, or 21%, in 2002 primarily due to the Wisconsin retail electric rate increases. Wisconsin Public Service Corporations Electric Utility Results (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Revenues $696.9 $610.7 14% Fuel and purchased power 217.2 212.8 2% Margins $479.7 $397.9 21% Sales in kilowatt hours 13,579.7 12,618.9 8% Wisconsin Public Services electric utility revenues increased $86.2 million, or 14%, in 2002 as the result of the electric rate increases and an 8% increase in overall electric sales volumes. Sales volumes were up 25% for lower margin, wholesale customers while sales to higher margin, residential customers increased 6% and sales to higher margin, commercial and industrial customers increased 3%. Summer weather was 7% warmer in 2002 than in 2001, and 23% warmer than normal. 98 &lt;PAGE&gt; Increased fuel costs for power generation were partially offset by lower purchased power expenses. Wisconsin Public Services fuel expense for generation plants increased $4.9 million, or 4%, in 2002. Wisconsin Public Services purchased power expense, however, decreased $0.5 million, or 1%, in 2002. Overall generation from Wisconsin Public Services plants increased 10% while purchased volumes decreased 3%. The change in the energy supply mix was largely due to the availability of less expensive power generation from the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. Wisconsin Public Service increased its ownership interest in the Kewaunee nuclear power plant to 59% in September 2001. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows Wisconsin Public Service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to Wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range. Wisconsin Public Service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus 2% from forecasted costs on an annualized basis. Wisconsin Public Service did not submit any fuel filings in 2002. Gas Utility Operations Effective April 1, 2001, the gas utility margin at Wisconsin Public Service includes the merged Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company operations. Wisconsin Public Service Corporations Gas Utility Results (Millions) 2002 2001 Change Revenues $310.7 $321.6 (3%) Purchase costs 198.6 230.2 (14%) Margins $112.1 $ 91.4 23% Throughput in therms 845.4 742.7 14% An increase in overall natural gas throughput volumes of 14% and the Wisconsin retail gas rate increase resulted in a higher gas utility margin of $20.7 million, or 23%, in 2002. Increased overall gas throughput volumes were partially the result of including 12 months of operations for former Wisconsin Fuel and Light in 2002 compared with the inclusion of 9 months of operations in 2001. Gas throughput volumes were also affected by a heating season that was 5% colder in 2002 than in 2001, but 3% milder than normal. Wisconsin Public Services gas revenues decreased $10.9 million, or 3%, in 2002 and gas purchase costs decreased $31.6 million, or 14%, largely as the result of a 26% decrease in the average unit cost of natural gas in 2002. Other Expenses/Income Utility operating and maintenance expense increased $64.7 million in 2002 largely due to amortization of regulatory deferrals, increased benefit costs, higher transmission expenses associated with American Transmission Company, increased expenses at the Kewaunee nuclear power plant (as a result of Wisconsin Public Service acquiring additional ownership interest in the plant), and increased energy conservation expenses. Utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased $9.3 million in 2002 largely due to additional plant assets at Wisconsin Public Service, including its increased ownership interest in the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. Lower depreciation expense of $5.5 million in 2002 related to decreased decommissioning earnings partially offset the increased plant asset depreciation. Other utility income decreased in 2002 primarily as the result of lower earnings of $5.7 million on Wisconsin Public Services nuclear decommissioning trust assets. Due to regulatory practice, a decrease in earnings on the trust assets is largely offset by decreased depreciation expense. 99 &lt;PAGE&gt; Other Nonutility Income Hydroelectric land sales resulted in pretax gains of $3.3 million at Wisconsin Public Service in 2002 compared with pretax gains of approximately $17 million in 2001. In addition, earnings on equity investments were higher in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to the investment in American Transmission Company. BALANCE SHEET WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE 2003 Compared with 2002 Net utility plant increased $146.6 million, or 8.5%, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. The adoption of Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective January 31, 2003, accounted for approximately $90.8 million of the increase in property, plant, and equipment. Wisconsin Public Service adopted Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective January 31, 2003, and as a result, capitalized a net asset retirement cost of $90.8 million (decreased to $78.5 million at December 31, 2003 due to depreciation). The remaining increase in property, plant, and equipment primarily relates to capital expenditures for the Pulliam combustion turbine, and gas and electric distribution equipment. The Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission recently expressed their views on the balance sheet classification of costs of removal for the utility industry and required that the amounts be reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a liability. As a result, WPS Resources reclassified costs of removal out of accumulated deprecation at December 31, 2003 and 2002. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about these accounting changes. Gas in storage increased $19.9 million at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 largely due to a 39% increase in the average price of natural gas experienced in 2003 compared to 2002. Investments and other assets increased $58.8 million at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 as a result of the recognition of an intangible pension asset related to the minimum pension liability we recorded at December 31, 2003 and additional investments in American Transmission Company. Accounts payable decreased $55.3 million at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 largely due to a $48.4 million payable that was recorded at December 31, 2002 resulting from the purchase of the De Pere Energy Center. This was paid in 2003. Regulatory liabilities increased $242.7 million at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 largely due to the reclassification of $167.9 million of non legal costs of removal from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal to regulatory liabilities. Most of the remaining increase relates to a regulatory liability that was recorded upon the adoption of Statement No. 143. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about this accounting change. Pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased $67.1 million at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 primarily due to the minimum pension liability that was recorded at December 31, 2003 for the administrative pension plan, which was driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to value our obligation under this plan. The $344.0 million asset retirement obligation recorded at December 31, 2003 is related to a legal retirement obligation identified as a result of our adoption of Statement No. 143 for the decommissioning of the irradiated portions of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about this accounting change. 100 &lt;PAGE&gt; The $451.6 million liability for nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal at December 31, 2002 was reclassified from accumulated depreciation in accordance with recent views expressed by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the utility industry. Historically, these costs of removal were reflected as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation in accordance with regulatory treatment. Upon adoption of Statement No. 143 on January 1, 2003, costs of removal with associated legal obligations of $290.5 million were removed from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal as these costs are now accounted for as asset retirement obligations. Costs of removal without an associated legal obligation, as defined by Statement No. 143, were reclassified from nuclear decommissioning and other costs of removal to a regulatory liability pursuant to Statement No. 71. See Trends WPS Resources for more information about this accounting change. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE Wisconsin Public Service believes that its cash, operating cash flows, and borrowing ability because of strong credit ratings, when taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Companys operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside its control. In addition, the Companys borrowing costs can be impacted by its short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. Currently, we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry (see Financing Cash Flows, Credit Ratings below). Operating Cash Flows During 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was $152.6 million, compared with $185.4 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to increased working capital requirements. Gas inventories increased $19.9 million due to high natural gas prices. Receivables and accrued revenues also increased due to higher natural gas prices. During 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $185.4 million, compared with $127.8 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in net income after adjustment for certain non cash items, as working capital changes were not significant. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used for investing activities was $182.2 million in 2003 compared to $184.0 million in 2002. The small decrease is attributed to a $29.4 decrease in capital expenditures and an increase in the sale of property, plant, and equipment of $26.2 million. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions of $48.4 million. See Asset Sales and Acquisitions below for further detail. Net cash used for investing activities was $184.0 million in 2002 compared to $131.8 million in 2001, an increase of $52.2 million. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures (discussed within Capital Expenditures below), as well as a decrease in dividends received from equity method investment (due to a decrease in the return of capital from the American Transmission Company), and a decrease in the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The decrease in the sale of property, plant, and equipment is primarily due to the 2001 sale of land on the Peshtigo River in northeastern Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Asset Sales and Acquisitions Certain acquisitions and asset sales that have a significant impact on investing cash flows are discussed below. In addition, see Note 6, Acquisitions and Sales of Assets for a more detailed discussion of asset sales and acquisitions. 101 &lt;PAGE&gt; On December 30, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service sold an additional 542 acres of land near the Peshtigo River to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for $6.5 million as part of a multi phase agreement reached between the parties in 2001. Under the terms of the 2001 agreement, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources bought more than 5,000 acres of land for $13.5 million in 2001. On April 18, 2003, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved Wisconsin Public Services request to transfer its interest in the Wausau, Wisconsin, to Duluth, Minnesota, transmission line to the American Transmission Company. American Transmission Company is a for profit transmission only company created by the transfer of transmission assets previously owned by multiple electric utilities serving the upper Midwest in exchange for an ownership interest in American Transmission Company. Wisconsin Public Service sold approximately $20.1 million of assets at book value related to the Wausau to Duluth transmission line to American Transmission Company in June 2003. No gain or loss was recognized on the transaction. Wisconsin Public Service will continue to manage construction of the project and be responsible for obtaining property rights necessary for the construction of the project. On December 16, 2002, Wisconsin Public Service purchased the 180 megawatt De Pere Energy Center for $120.4 million and terminated the related existing purchased power agreement. Wisconsin Public Service paid $72.0 million at the close of the transaction and the remaining $48.4 million in December 2003. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 are as follows: (Millions) Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Electric Utility $120.6 $157.0 $163.7 Gas Utility 40.7 34.0 24.9 Other 0.3 WPSC Consolidated $161.6 $191.0 $188.6 Capital expenditures in the electric utility were higher in 2002 compared to 2003 mainly due to construction of portions of the Pulliam combustion turbine at Wisconsin Public Service in 2002. Gas utility capital expenditures increased due to the installation of automated meter reading in 2003. As part of its regulated utility operations, on September 26, 2003 Wisconsin Public Service submitted an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin seeking approval to build a 500 megawatt coal fired generation facility near Wausau, Wisconsin. The facility is estimated to cost approximately $770 million (including the acquisition of coal trains), assuming the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin allows a current return on construction costs. As of December 31, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service has incurred a total cost of $4.0 million related to this project. In its 2003 rate order, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized deferral of costs related to development of the facility. On November 12, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service received a declaratory ruling allowing recovery of all reasonable costs (up to $71.2 million) related to the project incurred or committed to prior to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsins final decision regarding construction authorization. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service expects to incur additional construction costs of approximately $41 million to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support the generating facility through the date the generating facility goes into service. American Transmission Company will reimburse Wisconsin Public Service for the construction costs of the interconnection and related carrying costs when the generation facility becomes commercially operational. On February 11, 2004, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin determined Wisconsin Public Services application is "complete". The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin 102 &lt;PAGE&gt; Department of Natural Resources now have 180 days to make a decision on the project. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin may request from the Dane County Court of Appeals one 180 day extension. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources will create an environmental impact statement. The public will have opportunities to testify at public hearings. Technical hearings will also be held. Following a review of the application, the environmental impact statement, and the hearing testimony, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin will determine if the proposed project will be approved, modified or denied. On February 16, 2004, Wisconsin Public Service signed a Letter of Intent with Dairyland Power Cooperative for electric supply alternatives for 150 megawatts of energy from the proposed 500 megawatt coal fired generation facility. According to the agreement, Dairyland could choose to purchase an interest in the plant or buy electricity from it (we have since received written notification from Dairyland, confirming their intent to purchase an interest in the plant). In providing Dairyland with electric supply alternatives, Wisconsin Public Service can reduce the risks associated with building and operating the power plant. The agreement is part of Wisconsin Public Services continuing plan to provide least cost reliable energy for the increasing electric demand of its customers. This transaction is subject to a number of conditions including successfully developing a joint plant ownership and operating agreement, Dairyland obtaining financing approval from the Rural Utility Services, and Dairyland securing firm transmission service from the Midwest Independent System Operator on terms and conditions Dairyland deems acceptable. Capital expenditures at the electric utility were $6.7 million higher in 2001 compared to 2002, mostly related to the 2001 steam generator replacement at the Kewaunee nuclear power plant and the acquisition of Madison Gas and Electric Companys 17.8% interest in the Kewaunee nuclear power plant including its decommissioning trust assets. In the gas utility segment, capital expenditures increased $9.1 million in 2002 from 2001, partially due to the installation of automated meter reading. The remaining increase is attributed to various one time projects that occurred in 2002. Financing Cash Flows Net cash provided by financing activities was $30.9 million in 2003 compared to cash used for financing activities of $7.9 million in 2002. Wisconsin Public Service required cash from financing activities in 2003 as cash provided by operating activities was not adequate to fund investing activities. Wisconsin Public Services financing activities used cash of $7.9 million in 2002 and provided cash of $9.5 million in 2001. Cash was not required from financing activities in 2002 due to strong operating cash flows. Significant Financing Activities As of December 31, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service was in compliance with all of the covenants under its line of credit and its other debt obligations. Wisconsin Public Service established a 364 day credit line syndication for $115.0 million, during the third quarter of 2003. The prior credit line syndication was for $100.0 million. The credit line is used to back 100% of Wisconsin Public Services commercial paper borrowing program. Wisconsin Public Service had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2003 and $16.0 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Wisconsin Public Service had a $10.0 million short term note that renews annually and is due "on demand". Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, under a registration statement declared effective in 2002, issued $125.0 million of 4.80% 10 year senior notes in December 2003. The senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if Wisconsin Public Service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were 103 &lt;PAGE&gt; used to call $49.9 million of 7.125% first mortgage bonds on January 19, 2004, fund construction costs and capital additions, reduce short term indebtedness, and for other corporate utility purposes. Wisconsin Public Service used short term debt to retire $50.0 million of 6.8% first mortgage bonds on February 1, 2003 that had reached maturity and also retired $9.1 million of 6.125% tax exempt bonds on May 1, 2003. Wisconsin Public Service is evaluating the potential for refinancing existing debt in 2004. Wisconsin Public service issued $150.0 million of 4.875% 10 year senior notes in December 2002. The senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if Wisconsin Public Service retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds. Wisconsin Public Service used approximately $72 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to acquire the De Pere Energy Center and $69 million to retire short term debt. The balance of the net proceeds was used for other corporate utility purposes. Credit Ratings Wisconsin Public Service uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements. Wisconsin Public Service also periodically issues long term debt, receives equity contributions from WPS Resources, and makes payments for return of capital to WPS Resources to reduce short term debt, fund future growth, and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. The current credit ratings for Wisconsin Public Service are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys Wisconsin Public Service Corporation Bonds Preferred stock Commercial paper Credit line syndication AA A A 1+ Aa2 A2 P 1 Aa3 In November 2003, Moodys downgraded its long term credit ratings for Wisconsin Public Service one ratings level, leaving only commercial paper ratings unchanged. Moodys downgrade of Wisconsin Public Service is based on the expectation that the utilitys substantial capital spending program will exceed its retained cash flow through 2007, which is likely to lead to a meaningful increase in debt. Following the downgrade, Moodys set the ratings outlook at stable for Wisconsin Public Service. We believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the utility industry, and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a companys credit rating. These measures include business risk, liquidity risk, competitive position, capital mix, financial condition, predictability of cash flows, management strength, regulatory risk, and future direction. Some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios, while the qualitative ones are more subjective. Wisconsin Public Service holds a credit line to back 100% of its commercial paper borrowing. This credit facility is based on a credit rating of A 1+/P 1. A decrease in the commercial paper credit rating could adversely affect the company by increasing the interest rates at which it can borrow and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the company through the commercial paper market. A restriction in the companys ability to use commercial paper borrowing to meet its working capital needs could require it to secure funds through alternate sources resulting in higher interest expense, higher credit line fees, and a potential delay in the availability of funds. 104 &lt;PAGE&gt; Future Capital Requirements and Resources Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the contractual obligations of Wisconsin Public Service, including its subsidiaries. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2003 (Millions) Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Over 5 years Long term debt principal and interest payments $ 907.9 $ 80.5 $ 61.2 $ 61.2 $705.0 Operating lease obligations 14.7 4.1 3.4 2.3 4.9 Commodity purchase obligations 894.3 248.6 331.5 241.0 73.2 Purchase orders 167.6 124.9 37.3 5.4 Other 77.5 20.3 57.2 Total contractual cash obligations $2,062.0 $478.4 $490.6 $309.9 $783.1 Long term debt principal and interest payments represent bonds issued, notes issued, and loans made to Wisconsin Public Service. We record all principal obligations on the balance sheet. Commodity purchase obligations represent mainly commodity purchase contracts of Wisconsin Public Service. Wisconsin Public Service expects to recover the costs of its contracts in future customer rates. Purchase orders include obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations. Other mainly represents expected pension and post retirement funding obligations for the years of 2004 and 2005. Capital Requirements Wisconsin Public Service makes large investments in capital assets. Net construction expenditures are expected to be approximately $1,264 million in the aggregate for the 2004 through 2006 period (upon the closing of the sale of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant, expenditures would decrease approximately $44.9 million during this period). The largest of these expenditures is for the construction of the 500 megawatt coal fired generation facility near Wausau, Wisconsin, in which Wisconsin Public Service is expected to incur costs of $549 million between 2004 through 2006. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service expects to incur additional construction costs of approximately $12 million between 2004 and 2006 to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support the generating facility. Other significant anticipated expenditures during this three period include: combustion turbines $49 million pollution control equipment $23 million corporate services infrastructures $41 million automated meter reading $35 million nuclear fuel $33 million mercury control projects $59 million Other capital requirements for the three year period include a potential contribution of $3.3 million to the Kewaunee nuclear power plant decommissioning trust fund (depending on the sale of the Kewaunee assets). 105 &lt;PAGE&gt; Capital Resources For the period 2004 through 2006, Wisconsin Public Service plans to use funds internally generated net of forecasted dividend payments, cash proceeds from pending asset sales, and debt and equity financings to fund future capital requirements. Wisconsin Public Service plans to maintain debt to equity ratios consistent with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin rate order in effect at the time. Management believes Wisconsin Public Service has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs. Wisconsin Public Service has the ability to issue up to an additional $25.0 million of debt under its currently effective shelf registration statement. Wisconsin Public Service intends to file a new shelf registration statement in 2004 for an additional $350.0 million. Wisconsin Public Service has a new 364 day credit line syndication for $115.0 million. The credit line is used to back 100% of Wisconsin Public Services commercial paper borrowing program. As of December 31, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service has a total of $115.0 million available under its line of credit. In 2003, Wisconsin Public Service announced the sale of its portion of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. This sale is expected to settle in 2004. A portion of the proceeds related to the Kewaunee sale will be used to retire debt at Wisconsin Public Service. The remainder of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. For more information regarding the Kewaunee sale, see the discussion below. Other Future Considerations Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant On November 7, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service and Wisconsin Power and Light Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Kewaunee nuclear power plant to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc. Wisconsin Public Service is a 59% owner of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. The transaction is subject to approval from various regulatory agencies, including the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and several other state utility regulatory agencies and is projected to close in 2004. Approval has already been obtained from the Iowa Public Utility Commission. Wisconsin Public Service estimates that its share of the cash proceeds from the sale will approximate $130 million, subject to various post closing adjustments. The cash proceeds from the sale are expected to slightly exceed the carrying value of the Wisconsin Public Service assets being sold. In addition to the cash proceeds, Wisconsin Public Service will retain ownership of the assets contained in its non qualified decommissioning trust, one of two funds that were established to cover the eventual decommissioning of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant. The pretax fair value of the non qualified decommissioning trusts assets at December 31, 2003 was $115.1 million. Dominion will assume responsibility for the eventual decommissioning of Kewaunee and will receive Wisconsin Public Services qualified decommissioning trust assets that had a fair value of $239.7 million at December 31, 2003. Wisconsin Public Service will request deferral of the gain expected to result from this transaction and related costs from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Accordingly, the gain on the sale of the plant assets and the related non qualified decommissioning trust assets is expected to be returned to customers under future rate orders. Regulatory Wisconsin Effective March 21, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service received approval to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates $21.4 million (3.5%) and decrease Wisconsin retail natural gas rates $1.2 million (0.3%). 106 &lt;PAGE&gt; The 2003 retail electric and natural gas rates reflect a 12.0% return on equity and allowed average equity of 55% in the utilitys capital structure. On April 1, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service filed an application with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for authorization to increase retail electric and natural gas rates, effective January 1, 2004. The rate increases are necessary to recover the costs associated with the purchase of the De Pere Energy Center, fuel costs, maintenance of power production facilities and employee benefits. On December 19, 2003, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued a final written order authorizing a retail electric rate increase of $59.4 million (9.4%) and a retail natural gas rate increase of $8.9 million (2.2%), effective January 1, 2004. The 2004 rates reflect a 12.0% return on equity. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin also approved average equity of 56% in the utilitys capital structure. The amount of fuel and purchased power costs Wisconsin Public Service is authorized to recover in rates is established in its general rate filings. If the actual fuel and purchased power costs vary from the authorized level by more than 2% on an annual basis, Wisconsin Public Service is allowed, or may be required, to file an application adjusting rates for the remainder of the year to reflect actual costs for the year to date and updated projected costs. On October 29, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service filed to reduce rates by $1.9 million, due to a reduction in the costs of fuel and purchased power, for the period August 15, 2003 through December 31, 2003. On February 19, 2004, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved a refund of $2.7 million, which represents the originally filed amounts, adjustments, and interest. This refund will be credited to customer accounts in March 2004. A liability of $2.6 million was accrued as of December 31, 2003 in anticipation of this refund. As a result of the Kewaunee nuclear power plant unplanned outage in late January and early February 2004, and other fuel cost increases in 2004, the Wisconsin Public Service filed for a fuel cost increase of $7.4 million on February 27, 2004. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has scheduled a hearing for March 22, 2004 to determine the amount of the fuel cost increase to be recorded on an interim basis. Wisconsin Public Service expects that a final order will be issued in summer 2004 regarding this increase. Michigan Wisconsin Public Service filed for an increase in retail electric rates in the first quarter of 2003. On July 21, 2003, the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized an increase in retail electric rates of $0.3 million and the recovery of an additional $1.0 million of transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery mechanism, effective July 22, 2003. Federal On April 30, 2003, Wisconsin Public Service received a draft order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approving a 21%, or $4.1 million, increase in wholesale electric rates. The new wholesale rates were effective on May 11, 2003, and are subject to refund if the final rate increase is less. The draft order also granted the use of formula rates, which allow for the adjustment of wholesale electric rates to reflect actual costs without having to file additional rate requests. On March 4, 2004, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Wisconsin Public Service reached a tentative settlement regarding the final rate increase. Wisconsin Public Service anticipates no material refunds or other adjustments to revenues recorded under the interim rates based on the terms of the tentative agreement. The final settlement is anticipated to be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the second quarter of 2004. This was Wisconsin Public Services first rate increase for its wholesale electric customers in 17 years. 107 &lt;PAGE&gt; OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE See WPS RESOURCES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for information regarding off balance sheet arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE In May 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued proposed rules regarding the identification and disclosure of accounting estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies and the disclosure of initial adoption by a company of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial presentation. Under the first part of the proposal, a company would have to identify the accounting estimates reflected in its financial statements that required it to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Disclosures about those estimates would then be required if different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of the companys financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The Securities and Exchange Commission accepted comments on the proposed rules through July 19, 2002 and has not made any final decisions since that time. In anticipation of at least parts of this proposed rule being made final, we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. Risk Management Activities In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," Wisconsin Public Service records its derivatives at fair value. These amounts are calculated using estimates that are critical to the financial statements. Fair value of the derivatives is calculated using internal models, third party quotes, or a combination of the two methods. Changes in the expected electric and gas market prices could cause variability in the fair values of the derivatives. Because Wisconsin Public Service has regulatory approval to offset the changes in the fair value of derivatives with a regulatory asset or liability, such changes would be reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets only. Asset Impairment The merger of Wisconsin Fuel and Light into Wisconsin Public Service in 2001 resulted in Wisconsin Public Service recording goodwill related to its gas utility segment. The goodwill is tested for impairment yearly based on the guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between the gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments. A significant change in the gas utility market and or internal projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset, as a result of the impairment test. Revenues Wisconsin Public Service accrues estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed based on estimated unbilled sales. Estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales and weather factors. The estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations. Any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue. 108 &lt;PAGE&gt; Accruals for Pension and Postretirement Benefits Wisconsin Public Service estimates its benefit obligations using assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, expected returns on plan assets, and medical and dental cost trend rates. These assumptions are disclosed annually in our Annual Report on Form 10 K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the economy can cause adjustments in the assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations and would affect the related liabilities and expenses. For a more detailed sensitivity analysis see WPS RESOURCES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Regulatory Accounting The electric and gas utility segments of Wisconsin Public Service follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments. We defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, but are generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Once approved, we reduce regulatory assets and liabilities by recognition in income over the rate recovery period. If not approved, these regulatory assets or liabilities would be recognized in income in the then current period. If our electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for applying Statement No. 71, we would discontinue its application as defined under Statement No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." Assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation may no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurs. A write off of all Wisconsin Public Services regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2003, would result in a 4.9% decrease in total assets, a 23.5% decrease in total liabilities, and a 125.6% increase in income before taxes. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE Wisconsin Public Service has investments in related parties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These include the investment at WPS Investments, LLC, (a consolidated subsidiary of WPS Resources), in American Transmission Company LLC, Guardian Pipeline, LLC, and Wisconsin River Power Company. Wisconsin Public Service also enters into transactions with Upper Peninsula Power and WPS Energy Services, which are both wholly owned subsidiaries of WPS Resources. American Transmission Company, LLC is a for profit, transmission only company that owns, plans, maintains, monitors and operates electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois. At December 31, 2003, WPS Investments ownership in American Transmission Company was 19.8%. Wisconsin Public Service recorded related party transactions for services provided to and network transmission services received from American Transmission Company during 2003, 2002, and 2001. Charges to American Transmission Company for services provided by Wisconsin Public Service were $14.4 million, $12.9 million and $11.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Network transmission costs paid to American Transmission Company by Wisconsin Public Service were $33.6 million, $31.0 million and $25.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Guardian Pipeline, LLC owns a natural gas pipeline, which began operating in 2002, that stretches about 140 miles from near Joliet, Illinois, into southern Wisconsin. WPS Investments, LLC purchased its 33% interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC on May 30, 2003. 109 &lt;PAGE&gt; Wisconsin River Power Company, of which Wisconsin Public Service owns 50% of the voting stock, operates an oil fired combustion turbine and two hydroelectric plants on the Wisconsin River. The energy output from the hydroelectric plants is sold in equal parts to the three companies that previously owned equal portions of all the outstanding stock of Wisconsin River Power (Wisconsin Public Service, Wisconsin Power and Light, and Consolidated Water Power). The electric power from the combustion turbine is sold in equal parts to Wisconsin Public Service and Wisconsin Power and Light. Wisconsin Public Service recorded related party transactions for service provided to and purchases from Wisconsin River Power during 2003, 2002, and 2001. Revenues from service provided to Wisconsin River Power were $1.4 million, $1.5 million, and $0.9 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Purchases from Wisconsin River Power by Wisconsin Public Service were $2.0 million, $2.1 million, and $1.7 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Wisconsin Public Service recorded revenue from Upper Peninsula Power of $27.1 million, $21.5 million, and $21.4 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Wisconsin Public Service recorded revenue from WPS Energy Services of $16.4 million, $5.4 million, and $2.5 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Wisconsin Public Service recorded purchases from WPS Energy Services of $5.9 million, $3.3 million, $5.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks WPS Resources has potential market risk exposures related to commodity price risk, interest rate risk, equity return, and principal preservation risk. The current exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not significant. WPS Resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures. Interest Rate Risk WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from their variable rate long term debt and short term commercial paper borrowing. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so. WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, WPS Resources utilized one interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on a variable rate loan at one of its nonregulated subsidiaries. Based on the variable rate debt of WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service outstanding at December 31, 2003, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points in 2004 would increase annual interest expense by approximately $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Comparatively, based on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased interest expense in 2003 by approximately $0.6 million and $0.3 million. These amounts were determined by performing a sensitivity analysis on the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates on the variable rate debt of WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in the levels of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would take action to mitigate WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Services exposure to the change. Commodity Price Risk WPS Resources is exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the impact of market fluctuations in the price of certain commodities, including but not limited to electricity, natural gas, coal, fuel oil, and uranium, which are used and or sold by our subsidiaries in the normal course of their business. We employ established policies and procedures to reduce the market risk associated with changing commodity prices, including using various types of commodity and derivative instruments. WPS Resources exposure to commodity price risk in its regulated utilities is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale. Therefore, the value at risk amounts discussed below do not include measures for WPS Resources regulated utilities. To further manage commodity price risk, our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and electricity. WPS Power Development utilizes purchase and or sale contracts for electric fuel and electricity to help manage its commodity price risk. WPS Energy Services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with the changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers. WPS Energy Services also utilizes these instruments to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases. 111 &lt;PAGE&gt; For purposes of risk management disclosure, WPS Power Developments and WPS Energy Services activities are classified as non trading. The value at risk amounts discussed below are presented separately for both WPS Power Development and WPS Energy Services due to the differing market and timing exposures of each entity. Value at Risk To measure commodity price risk exposure, WPS Resources performs a value at risk (VaR) analysis of its exposures. VaR is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors, within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period. VaR models are relatively sophisticated. However, the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model. The instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used. VaR is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. VaR is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a 95% confidence level. The delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods, such as one day, are normally distributed. It does not take into account higher order risk exposures, so it may not provide a good approximation of the risk in a portfolio with substantial option positions. We utilized a delta normal approximation because our portfolio has limited exposure to optionality. Our VaR calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options as well as commodities held in inventory, such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant. Our VaR amount for WPS Energy Services was calculated to be $0.8 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $0.5 million at December 31, 2002. Our VaR amount for WPS Power Development was calculated to be $1.2 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $0.3 million at December 31, 2002. The increase for WPS Power Development was primarily due to increased volatility in our forward price curve for electricity. A significant portion of this VaR amount is mitigated by WPS Power Developments generating capabilities, which are excluded from the VaR calculation as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the average, high, and low VaR amounts for WPS Energy Services were $0.5 million, $0.8 million, and $0.4 million, respectively. The same amounts for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $0.5 million, $0.7 million, and $0.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the average, high, and low VaR amounts for WPS Power Development were $0.7 million, $1.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. The same amounts for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $1.5 million, $3.2 million, and $0.3 million. The average, high, and low amounts were computed using the VaR amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts. Equity Return and Principal Preservation Risk WPS Resources and Wisconsin Public Service currently fund liabilities related to employee benefits and nuclear decommissioning through various external trust funds. These funds are managed by various investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. WPS Resources maintains two main qualified pension plans. The pension liability for the Non administrative Employees Retirement Plan is currently over funded and no contributions to the plan are required. The pension liability for the Administrative Employees Retirement Plan has risen due to plan design changes and historically low interest rates. The liability of the Administrative Employees Retirement Plan exceeded the value of the Plans assets by $64.9 million at December 31, 2003 and 112 &lt;PAGE&gt; WPS Resources was, therefore, required to recognize a minimum pension liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87. Declines in the equity markets or continued declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs for these plans and possible future required contributions. Changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits or nuclear decommissioning could also impact future contributions. WPS Resources monitors the trust fund portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices. All decommissioning costs and most of the employee benefit costs relate to WPS Resources regulated utilities. As such, the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates, mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk WPS Resources is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of foreign operations owned and operated in Canada and transactions denominated in Canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity by our nonregulated subsidiaries. Forward foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges are utilized to manage the risk associated with currency fluctuations on certain firm sales and sales commitments denominated in Canadian dollars and certain Canadian dollar denominated asset and liability positions. WPS Resources exposure to foreign currency risk was not significant at December 31, 2003 or 2002. 113 &lt;PAGE&gt;
