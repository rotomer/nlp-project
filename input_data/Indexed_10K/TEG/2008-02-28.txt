ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Integrys Energy Group is a diversified holding company with regulated utility operations operating through six wholly owned subsidiaries, WPSC, PGL, NSG, UPPCO, MGUC, and MERC; nonregulated energy operations through its wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services; and also a 34.5% equity ownership interest in ATC (an electric transmission company operating in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois). Strategic Overview Integrys Energy Groups goal is the creation of long term value for shareholders and customers through growth in its regulated and nonregulated portfolio (while placing an emphasis on regulated growth). In order to create value, Integrys Energy Group is focused on: Maintaining and Growing a Strong Regulated Utility Base A strong regulated utility base is necessary to maintain a strong balance sheet, predictable cash flows, a desired risk profile, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings, which are critical to our success. Integrys Energy Group believes the following recent developments have helped, or will help, maintain and grow its regulated utility base: The February 2007 merger with PEC, which added the regulated natural gas distribution operations of PGL and NSG to the regulated utility base of Integrys Energy Group. Our investment in ATC was at 34.5% at December 31, 2007. ATC owned approximately $2.2 billion in net transmission and general plant assets at December 31, 2007 and anticipates additional capital investment of approximately $865 million over the next 3 years. Construction of the 500 megawatt coal fired Weston 4 base load power plant located near Wausau, Wisconsin, which is scheduled to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2008. This power plant is jointly owned with DPC. WPSC holds a 70% ownership interest in the Weston 4 power plant, with DPC owning the remaining 30% interest in the facility. The proposed acceleration of investment in the natural gas distribution system at PGL. The replacement of cast iron mains and investment in underground natural gas storage facilities is expected to total approximately $100 million through 2010. Investment of approximately $75 million in lateral infrastructure related to the connection of the WPSC distribution system to the Guardian II natural gas pipeline to Green Bay. WPSCs negotiations to purchase a 99 megawatt wind generation facility to be constructed in Howard County, Iowa. WPSCs continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators. Capital projects to construct and upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year. For more detailed information on Integrys Energy Groups capital expenditure program see "Liquidity and Capital Resources, Capital Requirements," below. Strategically Growing Nonregulated Business Integrys Energy Services is focused on growth in the competitive energy services and supply business through growing its customer base. Integrys Energy Group expects its nonregulated operations to provide between 20% and 30% of Integrys Energy Groups earnings, on average, in the future. Integrys Energy Group believes the following recent developments have helped, or will help, maintain and grow its nonregulated business: 29 The merger with PEC combined the nonregulated energy marketing businesses of both companies. The combination provided Integrys Energy Services with a strong market position in the Illinois retail electric market and expanded its originated wholesale natural gas business, creating a stronger, more competitive, and better balanced growth platform for the nonregulated business. The 2007 opening of nonregulated operations in Denver, Colorado, has allowed Integrys Energy Services to expand its operations into the Western Systems Coordinating Council markets. The 2007 completion of a 6.5 megawatt landfill gas project, the Winnebago Energy Center Development in Rockford, Illinois, which consists of gas cleanup equipment and engines to collect and burn landfill gas at the site to generate electricity. The on going development of renewable energy products, such as land fill gas and solar projects. Integrating Resources to Provide Operational Excellence Integrys Energy Group is committed to integrating resources of its regulated businesses and also its nonregulated businesses, while meeting any and all applicable regulatory and legal requirements. This will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and assist in lowering costs for certain activities. Integrys Energy Group believes the following recent developments have helped, or will help, integrate resources and provide operational excellence: The PEC merger is helping to align the best practices and expertise of both companies, which will continue to result in efficiencies by eliminating redundant and overlapping functions and systems. Integrys Energy Group expects the merger to generate annual pre tax synergy savings of approximately $106 million for the combined company by the end of the fifth full year of operations following completion of the merger. One time costs to achieve the synergies are expected to be approximately $155 million. Integrys Business Support, LLC, a wholly owned service company, was formed to achieve a significant portion of the cost synergies anticipated from the merger with PEC through the consolidation and efficient delivery of various support services and to provide more consistent and transparent allocation of costs throughout Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. "Competitive Excellence" and project management initiatives are being implemented at Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries to improve processes, reduce costs, and manage projects within budget and timeline constraints to provide more value to customers. Placing Strong Emphasis on Asset and Risk Management Our asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of our existing assets, the acquisition of assets, and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement our existing business and strategy, thereby providing the most efficient use of and best return on our resources while maintaining an acceptable risk profile. This strategy calls for a focus on the disposition of assets, including plants and entire business units, which are either no longer strategic to ongoing operations, are not performing as needed, or have an unacceptable risk profile. We maintain a portfolio approach to risk and earnings. Integrys Energy Group believes the following recent developments have helped, or will help, manage assets and risk: The combination of Integrys Energy Group and PEC created a larger, stronger, and more competitive regional energy company. This merger, along with the 2006 acquisition of the Michigan and Minnesota natural gas distribution operations, diversified the companys regulatory and geographic risk due to the expansion of utility operations to multiple jurisdictions. 30 The September 2007 sale of PEP, Integrys Energy Groups oil and natural gas production subsidiary acquired in the merger with PEC. The divesture of the oil and natural gas production business reduced Integrys Energy Groups business risk profile and provided funds to reduce debt. The January 2007 sale of WPS Niagara Generation, LLC for approximately $31 million. WPS Niagara Generation, LLC owned a 50 megawatt generation facility located in the Niagara Mohawk Frontier region in Niagara Falls, New York. Our risk management strategy, in addition to asset risk management, includes the management of market, credit, and operational risk through the normal course of business. Forward purchases and sales of electric capacity, energy, natural gas, and other commodities allow for opportunities to secure prices in a volatile energy market. Oversight of the risk profile related to these financial instruments is monitored daily in each business unit consistent with the companys financial risk management policy. Corporate oversight is provided through the Corporate Risk Management group which reports through the Chief Financial Officer. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, (Millions except per share amounts) 2007 2006 2005 Change in 2007 over 2006 Change in 2006 over 2005 Electric utility operations $ 87.4 $ 85.5 $ 64.2 2.2 % 33.2 % Natural gas utility operations 28.7 (2.3 ) 13.2 Nonregulated energy operations 98.0 72.3 74.1 35.5 % (2.4 )% Holding company and other operations (18.8 ) 0.3 5.9 (94.9 )% Oil and natural gas operations 56.0 Income available for common shareholders $ 251.3 $ 155.8 $ 157.4 61.3 % (1.0 )% Average basic shares of common stock 71.6 42.3 38.3 69.3 % 10.4 % Average diluted shares of common stock 71.8 42.4 38.7 69.3 % 9.6 % Basic earnings per share $ 3.51 $ 3.68 $ 4.11 (4.6 )% (10.5 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 3.50 $ 3.67 $ 4.07 (4.6 )% (9.8 )% 2007 income available for common shareholders increased $95.5 million and 2007 diluted earnings per share decreased $0.17, both compared to 2006. 2006 income available for common shareholders decreased $1.6 million and 2006 diluted earnings per share decreased $0.40, both compared to 2005. Significant factors impacting the change in earnings and diluted earnings per share were as follows (and are discussed in more detail thereafter): Electric Utility Operations: Earnings increased $1.9 million in 2007 over 2006, resulting primarily from the following: Retail electric rate increases at both WPSC and UPPCO had a positive year over year impact on operating income. Favorable weather conditions at WPSC contributed an approximate $6.0 million ($3.6 million after tax) year over year increase in operating income; however, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage. Fuel and purchased power costs were higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in 2006, driving a $14.4 million ($8.6 million after tax) negative variance in operating income. 31 Maintenance expense related to WPSCs power plants was higher in 2007 compared to 2006, driven by an increase in unplanned outages in 2007 as well as the extension of some 2007 planned outages. Earnings increased $21.3 million from 2005 to 2006, primarily due to the following: Fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were more than what was recovered in rates during the same period in 2005 (the under collection in 2005 was primarily due to the impact 2005 hurricanes had on natural gas prices), contributed an estimated $14 million after tax, year over year increase in earnings. A PSCW ruling, which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the 2004 Kewaunee nuclear plant outage as well as a portion of the loss on the Kewaunee sale, resulted in the write off of $13.7 million of regulatory assets in 2005, which resulted in an after tax reduction in earnings in 2005 of approximately $8 million (positive variance compared with 2006 earnings). Retail electric rate increases at both WPSC and UPPCO also had a positive year over year impact on earnings. Unfavorable weather conditions in 2006, compared with 2005, had an estimated $9 million year over year negative after tax impact on electric utility earnings. Natural Gas Utility Operations: Financial results improved $31.0 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily due to the following: Financial results for MGUC and MERC increased $18.1 million, from a combined net loss of $11.3 million in 2006, to earnings of $6.8 million in 2007. The positive change in earnings at MGUC and MERC was driven by the fact that these natural gas utilities operated during the first quarter heating season in 2007, but were not acquired by Integrys Energy Group until after the first quarter 2006 heating season. In addition, MGUC and MERC incurred a combined $11.8 million ($7.1 million after tax) of transition costs in 2006 for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees. In 2007, MGUC and MERC were allocated $1.7 million ($1.0 million after tax) of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the PEC merger. Regulated natural gas utility earnings at WPSC increased $13.5 million, from earnings of $9.6 million in 2006, to earnings of $23.1 million in 2007. Higher earnings were driven by increased volumes due to colder weather conditions during the heating season. A natural gas rate increase effective January 12, 2007 also contributed to the increase. The PEC natural gas utilities (PGL and NSG), which were acquired effective February 21, 2007, recognized a combined net loss of approximately $1 million, primarily related to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities, which derive earnings during the heating season (first and fourth quarters). Because of the late February acquisition date, results for the majority of the two coldest months of the year were not included in natural gas utility earnings in 2007. The 2007 net income for PGL was less than the level we would normally expect, primarily due to increased costs of providing service. It is important to note, however, that we received a rate increase at PGL in February 2008, which will help offset rising costs. Please see Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on the rate increase. 32 Earnings decreased $15.5 million from 2005 to 2006, primarily due to the following: MGUC and MERC (acquired on April 1 and July 1, 2006, respectively) had a combined net loss of approximately $11 million. Included in the net loss incurred by MGUC and MERC, was $7.1 million of after tax external transition costs incurred by these regulated natural gas utilities. The net loss recognized at MGUC and MERC in excess of transition costs incurred can be attributed to not owning these operations during the January through March 2006 heating season and warmer than normal weather conditions during the last few months of 2006. From the acquisition dates through December 31, 2006, actual heating degree days were 13.9% and 7.3% below normal for MGUC and MERC, respectively. Earnings at WPSCs natural gas utility also decreased approximately $4 million, driven by unfavorable weather conditions and customer conservation efforts. Nonregulated Energy Operations: Earnings increased $25.7 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily due to the following: Operating income at Integrys Energy Services increased $40.2 million ($24.1 million after tax). After tax income from discontinued operations at Integrys Energy Services increased $7.5 million, driven by the sale of Niagara Generation, LLC in the first quarter of 2007. Miscellaneous expense at Integrys Energy Services decreased $11.1 million ($6.7 million after tax), driven by a decrease in pre tax losses recognized for the period related to Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility. Minority interest income decreased $3.7 million ($2.2 million after tax) as Integrys Energy Services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and, therefore, did not share in losses from this facility in 2007. Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized from Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility decreased $15.9 million, from $29.5 million in 2006, to $13.6 million in 2007. Earnings decreased $1.8 million from 2005 to 2006, primarily due to the following: An $11.0 million ($6.6 million after tax) increase in interest expense due to higher working capital requirements, primarily related to growth in Integrys Energy Services natural gas operations. A $10.6 million ($6.4 million after tax) increase in miscellaneous expenses, primarily related to increased tons procured from Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility and the fact that Integrys Energy Services received no royalty payments from this investment in 2006. A $4.2 million after tax decrease in income from discontinued operations. The items negatively impacting earnings (discussed above) were partially offset by a $14.4 million ($8.6 million after tax) increase in margin (including an $11.1 million pre tax decrease in gains on derivative instruments used to protect the value of Section 29/45K tax credits). A $6.7 million ($4.0 million after tax) decrease in operating expenses, primarily related to the recognition of a $9.0 million pre tax gain on the sale of WPS ESI Gas Storage, LLC in the second quarter of 2006. A $3.4 million increase in Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized from Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility. 33 Holding Company and Other Operations: In 2007, financial results decreased $19.1 million, from earnings of $0.3 million in 2006, to a net loss of $18.8 million in 2007. See "Overview of Holding Company and Other Segment Operations," for more information. In 2006, earnings decreased $5.6 million from earnings of $5.9 million in 2005, to earnings of $0.3 million in 2006. See "Holding Company and Other Segment Operations," for more information. Oil and Natural Gas Operations: In connection with the PEC merger, Integrys Energy Group announced its intent to divest of PECs oil and natural gas production operations, PEP. PEP was sold in the third quarter of 2007. In 2007, PEP recognized earnings of $56.0 million, including $58.5 million of earnings reported as discontinued operations. The $2.5 million loss reported in continuing operations related primarily to intercompany expense allocations to PEP (salaries, interest expense, etc.) related to employees and debt that remained at Integrys Energy Group after the sale. The sale of PEP resulted in a $7.6 million after tax gain. Earnings per share: Diluted earnings per share was impacted by the items discussed above as well as an increase of 29.4 million shares (69.3%) in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of Integrys Energy Groups common stock from 2006 to 2007 and an increase of 3.7 million shares (9.6%) in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of Integrys Energy Groups common stock from 2005 to 2006. Integrys Energy Group issued 31.9 million shares of common stock on February 21, 2007, in conjunction with the merger with PEC, issued 2.7 million shares of common stock in May 2006 in order to settle its forward equity agreement with an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities, and issued 1.9 million shares of common stock through a public offering in November 2005. Additional shares were also issued under the Stock Investment Plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Utility Operations In 2007, utility operations included the regulated electric segment, consisting of the regulated electric operations of WPSC and UPPCO, and the regulated natural gas utility segment, consisting of the natural gas operations of WPSC, PGL, NSG, MGUC, and MERC. The natural gas operations of WPSC, MGUC, and MERC were included for all of 2007, while the natural gas operations of PGL and NSG were included from February 22, 2007 through December 31, 2007. The natural gas operations of WPSC were included for all of 2006, while the natural gas operations of MGUC and MERC were included from April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and July 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, utility operations included the regulated electric segment, including the electric operations of WPSC and UPPCO, and the regulated natural gas utility segment, including the natural gas operations of WPSC. 34 Regulated Electric Segment Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Change in 2007 over 2006 Change in 2006 over 2005 Revenues $ 1,246.1 $ 1,099.4 $ 1,037.1 13.3 % 6.0 % Fuel and purchased power costs 636.5 551.0 444.2 15.5 % 24.0 % Margins 609.6 548.4 592.9 11.2 % (7.5 )% Operating and maintenance expense 321.1 265.3 355.7 21.0 % (25.4 )% Depreciation, amortization and decommissioning expense 80.1 78.5 120.4 2.0 % (34.8 )% Taxes other than income 43.2 41.6 38.5 3.8 % 8.1 % Operating income $ 165.2 $ 163.0 $ 78.3 1.3 % 108.2 % Sales in kilowatt hours Residential 3,173.6 3,144.8 3,127.4 0.9 % 0.6 % Commercial and industrial 8,750.9 8,645.2 8,641.8 1.2 % % Wholesale 4,024.9 4,093.1 3,849.2 (1.7 )% 6.3 % Other 42.4 42.2 41.7 0.5 % 1.2 % Total sales in kilowatt hours 15,991.8 15,925.3 15,660.1 0.4 % 1.7 % Weather WPSC Heating degree days 7,102 6,785 7,401 4.7 % (8.3 )% Cooling degree days 634 521 649 21.7 % (19.7 )% Revenue 2007 Compared with 2006: Regulated electric revenue increased $146.7 million, driven by the following: On January 11, 2007, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued a final written order to WPSC authorizing a retail electric rate increase of $56.7 million (6.6%), effective January 12, 2007, for Wisconsin electric customers. In June 2006, the MPSC issued a final written order to UPPCO authorizing an annual retail electric rate increase for UPPCO of $3.8 million (4.8%), effective June 28, 2006. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information related to the retail electric rate increases at WPSC and UPPCO. On a per unit basis, fuel and purchased power costs were approximately 17% higher during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the same period in 2006. In addition, sales volumes increased 0.4%, primarily related to an increase in sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers, driven by warmer weather during the cooling season and colder weather during the heating season (a portion of heating load is electric) in 2007, compared with 2006. The increase in sales volumes related to weather was partially offset by an approximate 2% decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage, driven by customer conservation resulting from higher energy costs and weaker general economic conditions. 35 2006 Compared with 2005: Regulated electric revenue increased $62.3 million, driven by the following: Approved 2006 electric rate increases for WPSC and UPPCO retail electric customers and rate increases for WPSCs wholesale customers resulting from the formula rate mechanism in place for these customers. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information related to these rate increases. Electric sales volumes increased 1.7%, primarily related to a 6.3% increase in sales volumes to wholesale customers due to higher demand and new wholesale contracts. Unfavorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 2005, partially offset the increases discussed above. Margin 2007 Compared with 2006: The regulated electric margin increased $61.2 million, driven by the following: A $57.0 million (11.5%) increase in the electric utility margin at WPSC. WPSCs margin was positively impacted by the retail electric rate increases discussed above and by higher electric sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers related to weather. Favorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons positively impacted margin by an estimated $6.0 million. The year over year change in WPSCs margin was also positively impacted by a $16.2 million decrease in the 2006 margin related to the accrual of the refund to wholesale customers in 2006 of their portion of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, the decrease in the 2006 margin related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expenses in 2006 and, therefore, did not have an impact on earnings. No such accrual to wholesale customers occurred in 2007; however, the payment of the refund was made in 2007. Partially offsetting the increase in WPSCs margin, fuel, and purchased power costs were 3.7% higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were 10.5% less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in 2006, driving a $14.4 million negative variance in WPSCs electric margin. In 2007, fuel and purchased power prices were above what was projected in the rate case primarily due to higher than anticipated commodity costs and the market effects of unplanned plant outages. On October 6, 2007, a lightning strike hit Weston 3. The unit returned to full service on January 14, 2008. The unscheduled outage did not have a significant impact on the electric utility margin as the PSCW approved deferral of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly related to the outage. The outage did, however, cause the price of purchased power from other sources to increase. Excluding the additional purchased power which resulted from the Weston 3 outage, fuel and purchased power costs at WPSC increased 17% in 2007, compared with the same period in 2006, primarily related to the higher per unit cost of fuel and purchased power required from the market to serve WPSCs customers. UPPCOs margin increased approximately $4 million, primarily due to its retail electric rate increase, effective June 2006, and higher retail sales volumes. 36 2006 Compared with 2005: The regulated electric margin decreased $44.5 million, driven by the following: A $48.7 million decrease in WPSCs electric margin, primarily related to the sale of the Kewaunee nuclear generation plant to Dominion Energy Kewaunee on July 5, 2005, and the related power purchase agreement. Excluding the $54.2 million increase in fixed payments made to Dominion Energy Kewaunee during the year ended December 31, 2006, WPSCs electric utility margin increased $5.5 million. The retail and wholesale electric rate increases discussed above had a favorable impact on WPSCs regulated electric margin. WPSCs fuel and purchased power costs were less than were recovered in rates during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were more than were recovered in rates during the same period in 2005 (the under collection in 2005 was primarily due to the impact 2005 hurricanes had on natural gas prices), which had an estimated $23 million positive year over year impact on margin. WPSCs margin was also positively impacted by higher wholesale electric sales volumes, driven by higher demand from existing customers and new wholesale customer contracts. The increase in WPSCs margin was partially offset by a $70.8 million decrease in 2006 margin related to the refund to retail customers and the accrual for the refund to wholesale customers of a portion of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund. Also, unfavorable weather conditions during the 2006 heating and cooling seasons negatively impacted margin by an estimated $14 million UPPCOs margin increased approximately $4 million primarily due to its first retail electric base rate increase since 2002. Operating Income 2007 Compared with 2006: Operating income increased $2.2 million, driven by the $61.2 million increase in regulated electric margin discussed above, partially offset by a $54.3 million (23.7%) increase in operating and maintenance expenses at WPSC and a combined $3.2 million increase in depreciation and taxes other than income taxes at the regulated electric utility. The change in operating and maintenance expense at WPSC was primarily related to the following: Regulated electric maintenance expenses increased $15.3 million, driven by longer than anticipated planned outages and a higher number of unplanned outages year over year (which included major overhauls planned at the Weston 2 and Weston 3 generation stations and the De Pere Energy Center, planned major turbine and generator work performed at the Pulliam electric generation station, and several unplanned outages at the Weston 3 generation station). Regulated electric transmission expenses increased $14.2 million, primarily related to higher rates charged by MISO and ATC due to additional transmission investment. The regulated electric segment of WPSC was allocated external costs to achieve merger synergies of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. 37 Amortization in 2006 of the regulatory liability recorded for WPSCs obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to wholesale electric ratepayers contributed $16.2 million to the increase in WPSCs operating and maintenance expense. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, the 2006 increase in operating and maintenance expense related to this refund was offset by a corresponding increase in 2006 margin and, therefore, did not have an impact on earnings. Lower pension, post retirement, and other employee benefit costs partially offset the increase in regulated electric operating and maintenance expense at WPSC. An increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investment at the electric utility, while the increase in taxes other than income reflected an increase in sales year over year. 2006 Compared with 2005: Operating income increased $85.1 million, driven by a $90.8 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense, and a $41.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by the $44.5 million decrease in the regulated electric margin. The change in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to the following: Partial amortization of the regulatory liability recorded for WPSCs obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to retail and wholesale electric ratepayers contributed $70.8 million to the decrease in operating expenses in 2006, compared with 2005. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, the decrease in operating expense related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in margin. Operating and maintenance expense related to the Kewaunee nuclear plant decreased approximately $17 million, driven by the sale of this facility in July 2005. The decrease in operating and maintenance expense related to Kewaunee did not have a significant impact on income available for common shareholders as WPSC is still purchasing the same amount of power from this facility as it obtained from it when WPSC owned a 59% interest in the plant. The cost of the power is included as a component of utility cost of fuel, natural gas, and purchased power. As a result of the PSCWs disallowance of certain costs, WPSC incurred a $6.1 million charge in 2005 related to one half the loss on the sale of Kewaunee, creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses. Also, as disallowed by the PSCW, WPSC wrote off $2.1 million in 2005 of previously deferred operating and maintenance expenses related to the 2004 extended outage at Kewaunee, creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses. Salaries and employee benefits also decreased in part due to the sale of Kewaunee in 2005. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating and maintenance expense, software amortization increased $5.4 million, driven by the late 2005 implementation of a new customer billing system. Excluding Kewaunee, maintenance expenses at the electric utility segment were up $4.9 million. Planned maintenance was required on certain combustion turbines, and maintenance expense related to electric distribution assets also increased. Electric transmission expense increased $4.1 million. The change in depreciation, amortization and decommissioning expense was primarily related to the following: 38 Approximately $41 million of decommissioning expense was recorded during 2005, compared with no decommissioning expense recorded in 2006. In 2005, realized gains on decommissioning trust assets were substantially offset by decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice (see analysis of "Miscellaneous Income" below). A $10.2 million decrease in depreciation expense resulting from the sale of Kewaunee in July 2005. Subsequent to the sale of Kewaunee, decommissioning expense is no longer recorded. An increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investment at the electric utility partially offset the overall decrease in depreciation and decommissioning expense.

Revenue 2007 Compared with 2006: Regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased $1,426.8 million, driven by the following: PGL and NSG (acquired February 21, 2007) generated $1,118.5 million of natural gas utility revenue and contributed approximately 1.5 billion therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2007. MERC (which acquired natural gas distribution operations in Minnesota on July 1, 2006) generated $294.0 million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately 705 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2007, compared with $123.0 million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately 348 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2006. 39 MGUC (which acquired natural gas distribution operations in Michigan on April 1, 2006) generated $220.2 million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately 311 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2007, compared with $110.1 million of natural gas revenue and approximately 193 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes during 2006. WPSCs natural gas utility revenue increased $27.2 million, from $443.8 million in 2006, to $471.0 million in 2007, driven by the following: On January 11, 2007, the PSCW issued a final written order to WPSC authorizing a retail natural gas rate increase of $18.9 million (3.8%), effective January 12, 2007. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information related to the retail natural gas rate increase at WPSC. An 8.6% increase in natural gas throughput volumes. The increase in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by a 10.3% increase in residential volumes and a 70.7% increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility. The increase in sales volumes to residential customers was driven in part by colder year over year weather conditions during the 2007 heating season. The increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility was driven by an increase in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units. Natural gas prices were 10.1% lower on a per unit basis, compared with 2006, resulting in a decrease in natural gas utility revenue, which partially offset the overall increase in natural gas utility revenue at WPSC. 2006 Compared with 2005: Regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased $154.9 million, driven by the following: The acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in Michigan by MGUC on April 1, 2006, and the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in Minnesota by MERC on July 1, 2006. These acquisitions contributed approximately $233 million to natural gas utility revenue and approximately 541 million therms to natural gas throughput volumes in 2006. WPSCs natural gas utility revenue was $443.8 million in 2006, compared with $522.0 million in 2005. Lower natural gas revenues at WPSC were primarily related to: A 12.2% decrease in natural gas throughput volumes, primarily related to a 61.0% decrease in natural gas throughput volumes sold to the electric utility for electric generation and a 9.2% decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers. The decrease in throughput volumes to the electric utility resulted from a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 2005, and from higher dispatch of these peaking generation units by MISO in 2005 for reliability purposes. The decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers was also driven by unfavorable weather conditions in 2006 compared with 2005, as well as customer conservation efforts. Particularly at the beginning of 2006, customers were taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices in the first half of 2006. In 2006, natural gas prices were 1.4% lower on a per unit basis, compared with 2005, resulting from a large decline in the price of natural gas in the second half of 2006, also contributing to the decrease in natural gas revenue. Partially offsetting the decrease in WPSCs natural gas utility revenue was the 2006 natural gas rate increase at WPSC (see Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information related to this rate increase). 40 Margin 2007 Compared with 2006: The regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased $467.1 million, driven by the following: The combined margin provided by PGL and NSG in 2007 was $387.2 million. The combined margin at MGUC and MERC increased $55.1 million, from $59.1 million in 2006, to $114.2 million in 2007. The increase in natural gas margin at MGUC and MERC was driven primarily by the fact that MGUC and MERC operated during the first quarter heating season in 2007, but were not acquired by Integrys Energy Group until after the first quarter heating season in 2006. WPSCs natural gas margin increased $24.8 million, from $124.0 million in 2006, to $148.8 million in 2007. As discussed in more detail above, the increase in WPSCs margin was driven by the retail natural gas rate increase and an increase in throughput volumes to higher margin residential customers due in part to colder year over year weather conditions during the heating season. The increase in throughput volumes sold to the electric utility did not have a significant impact on WPSCs natural gas utility margin. 2006 Compared with 2005: The regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased $58.5 million, driven by the following: The combined margin provided by MGUC and MERC was approximately $59 million. WPSCs natural gas utility margin decreased $0.6 million. As discussed in more detail above, a decrease in throughput volumes to higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by the natural gas rate increase. Operating Income 2007 Compared with 2006: Operating income increased $74.7 million, driven by the $467.1 million increase in the regulated natural gas utility margin, partially offset by a $306.1 million increase in operating and maintenance expense, a $65.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $21.3 million increase in taxes other than income taxes. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to the following: Combined operating and maintenance expenses of $292.9 million were incurred by PGL and NSG in 2007. Combined operating and maintenance expense at MGUC and MERC increased approximately $9 million, primarily due to the fact that both of these businesses incurred operating expenses for only a partial year in 2006, compared to incurring a full year of operating and maintenance expenses in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, $11.8 million of combined operating and maintenance expense related to external transition costs, primarily for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees. For the year ended December 31, 2007, MGUC and MERC were allocated $1.7 million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the PEC merger. 41 Operating expenses related to WPSCs natural gas operations increased $3.7 million year over year, due primarily to the allocation of $2.8 million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the PEC merger. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to the merger with PEC (a combined $59.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense was recognized at PGL and NSG in 2007) and an increase in depreciation expense at MERC and MGUC (these businesses were not included in results of operations for the full year in 2006). Depreciation and amortization expense at WPSCs natural gas utility was relatively flat year over year. The increase in taxes other than income taxes from 2006 to 2007 was primarily related to the merger with PEC ($16.8 million of taxes other than income taxes were recognized at PGL and NSG in 2007), and the acquisition of the Michigan and Minnesota natural gas distribution operations, which were not included in results of operations for the full year in 2006. Taxes other than income taxes are primarily related to property taxes, real estate taxes, gross receipts taxes, and payroll taxes paid by these companies. 2006 Compared with 2005: Operating income decreased $12.5 million, driven by a $71.0 million increase in total operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by the $58.5 million increase in regulated natural gas utility margin as discussed above. The increase in operating expenses is explained below. Operating and maintenance expenses increased $52.1 million. The increase in operating and maintenance expense at the regulated natural gas utility segment was driven by $56.6 million of combined operating and maintenance expense incurred by MGUC and MERC. Of the $56.6 million of operating and maintenance expense incurred by MGUC and MERC during the year ended December 31, 2006, $11.8 million related to external transition expenses, primarily for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees. Partially offsetting the increase in operating and maintenance expenses related to MGUC and MERC, operating expenses related to WPSCs natural gas operations decreased, driven by decreases in various employee benefit related expenses. The $13.2 million year over year increase in depreciation expense recorded at the regulated natural gas utility segment was driven by a combined $10.4 million of depreciation expense recorded by MGUC and MERC for the year ended December 31, 2006. Continued capital investment at WPSCs natural gas utility also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense. The $5.7 million increase in taxes other than income taxes was driven by $4.8 million of taxes other than income taxes recorded by MGUC and MERC, primarily related to property taxes. Integrys Energy Services Operations Integrys Energy Services is a diversified nonregulated energy supply and services company serving residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers in developed competitive markets in the United States and Canada. 42 Integrys Energy Services Segment Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, (Millions, except natural gas sales volumes) 2007 2006 2005 Change in 2007 Over 2006 Change in 2006 Over 2005 Revenues $ 6,979.7 $ 5,159.1 $ 5,314.9 35.3 % (2.9 )% Cost of fuel, natural gas, and purchased power 6,675.6 4,978.0 5,148.6 34.1 % (3.3 )% Margins $ 304.1 $ 181.1 $ 166.3 67.9 % 8.9 % Margin Detail Electric and other margins $ 164.9 $ 60.5 $ 105.3 172.6 % (42.5 )% Natural gas margins $ 139.2 $ 120.6 $ 61.0 15.4 % 97.7 % Operating and maintenance expense $ 159.4 $ 81.5 $ 88.9 95.6 % (8.3 )% Depreciation and amortization 14.4 9.4 9.5 53.2 % (1.1 )% Taxes other than income taxes 7.1 7.2 5.4 (1.4 )% 33.3 % Operating Income $ 123.2 $ 83.0 $ 62.5 48.4 % 32.8 % Gross volumes (includes volumes both physically delivered and net settled) Wholesale electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours 132,623.6 58,794.9 44,778.3 125.6 % 31.3 % Retail electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours 14,849.7 6,554.1 8,021.0 126.6 % (18.3 )% Wholesale natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet 483.1 402.2 338.1 20.1 % 19.0 % Retail natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet 368.8 314.5 276.6 17.3 % 13.7 % Physical volumes (includes only transactions settled physically for the periods shown) Wholesale electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours * 3,599.7 968.2 1,515.6 271.8 % (36.2 )% Retail electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours * 14,584.4 4,565.6 6,594.5 219.4 % (30.8 )% Wholesale natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet * 445.6 373.5 327.8 19.3 % 13.9 % Retail natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet * 319.4 264.0 227.7 21.0 % 15.9 % * Represents gross physical volumes. Revenue 2007 Compared with 2006 Year over year, revenues increased approximately $1.8 billion. The increase was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of the addition of the nonregulated energy operations of PEC and an average increase in 2007 electric prices of over 10%. In addition to revenue and volume contributions from the merger with PEC, retail electric sales volumes and related revenue increased as a result of Integrys Energy Services new retail electric product offerings to existing markets and expansion into new retail electric markets. Wholesale electric sales volumes and revenue increased as a result of the additional wholesale origination structured transactions. Wholesale natural gas volumes increased as a result of an increase in the profitability of wholesale origination structured natural gas transactions throughout 2006 and into 2007. Some of these transactions were entered into in prior periods for future delivery; therefore, Integrys Energy Services is seeing an increase in volumes in the periods in which these transactions settle. Retail natural gas volumes also increased, driven by favorable pricing compared with 2006, which encouraged new and existing customers to enter into or extend supply contracts with Integrys Energy Services. 2006 Compared with 2005 Year over year, revenues decreased $155.8 million, primarily related to a decrease in both physical retail and wholesale electric sales volumes and a decrease in energy prices during the latter half of 2006. The decrease in physical retail electric sales volumes was driven by a decrease in retail electric sales volumes in Ohio as aggregation sales in Ohio ended on December 31, 2005, with the expiration of Integrys Energy Services contracts with Ohio aggregation customers. Michigan retail electric sales volumes also decreased as many customers returned to their utility supplier beginning in 2005 and continuing into 2006 as a result of high wholesale energy prices and utility tariff changes, which significantly lowered the savings that customers could obtain from contracting with non utility 43 suppliers. In other areas, lower wholesale energy prices in the latter half of 2006 allowed Integrys Energy Services to sign up a significant number of new retail customers. The decrease in physically settled wholesale electric sales volumes was driven by a trend toward more financially settled transactions in 2006, compared to 2005. Margins Integrys Energy Services margin increased $123.0 million from 2006 to 2007 and increased $14.8 million from 2005 to 2006. The table below provides a summary of the significant items contributing to the change in margin. "Other significant items" in the table below are generally related to the timing of gain and loss recognition on certain transactions and the settlement of the derivative instruments used to protect the value of Section 29/45K tax credits. Increase (Decrease) in Margin in (Millions except natural gas sales volumes) 2007 2006 Electric and other margins Realized gains on structured origination contracts $ 11.8 $ 6.3 Realized retail electric margin 15.9 (2.9 ) All other wholesale electric operations 3.9 4.8 Other significant items: Oil option activity 22.0 (11.1 ) Retail mark to market activity 45.3 (27.3 ) 2005 liquidation of electric supply contract 5.5 (14.6 ) Net increase (decrease) in electric and other margins 104.4 (44.8 ) Natural gas margins Realized natural gas margins 8.0 32.2 Other significant items: Mass market supply options 6.6 (8.4 ) Spot to forward differential (0.2 ) 5.4 Other mark to market activity 4.2 30.4 Net increase in natural gas margins 18.6 59.6 Net increase in Integrys Energy Services margin $ 123.0 $ 14.8 Electric and Other Margins Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins increased $104.4 million from 2006 to 2007 and decreased $44.8 million from 2005 to 2006. The 2007 electric and other margin included the negative impact of $15.2 million of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the merger with PEC. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins. 44 Realized gains on structured origination contracts Realized gains on structured origination contracts increased $11.8 million, from $6.3 million in 2006 to $18.1 million in 2007. Origination contracts are physical, customer based agreements with municipalities, merchant generators, cooperatives, municipalities, and regulated utilities. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in existing markets in the Midwest and Northeastern United States, as well as expansion into the markets in the western United States. Realized gains on structured origination contracts increased $6.3 million from 2005 to 2006. The increase was primarily due to realized gains from origination contracts involving the sale of energy through structured transactions to wholesale customers in the Midwest and northeastern United States. These origination contracts were not in place in 2005. Integrys Energy Services provided products to large origination customers desiring to take advantage of falling energy prices. Realized retail electric margin The realized retail electric margin increased $15.9 million from $18.3 million in 2006 to $34.2 million in 2007. The change was primarily due to the following: A $13.9 million increase related to operations in Illinois, driven by the merger with PECs nonregulated business and the addition of new customers due to the expiration of certain regulatory provisions in the state in 2007 that effectively opened the market to nonregulated energy suppliers. A $6.0 million increase related to operations in Texas, as a result of further penetration into this market resulting from continued marketing efforts. Retail offerings in Texas first began in the third quarter of 2006. A $3.6 million increase related to operations in New England as new customers were added due to an increased sales focus in this region. Partially offsetting the increases discussed above were: A $4.4 million decrease related to Michigan operations as many customers continued to return to utility suppliers as a result of high wholesale energy prices and changes in utility tariffs which have continued to make the Michigan energy market less competitive. A $3.3 million decrease related to operations in the state of New York, related to a change in the product mix offered to customers in response to utility rate structure changes. The realized retail electric margin decreased $2.9 million from 2005 to 2006. The decrease was primarily driven by an $8.2 million decrease in margin in Ohio and a $3.7 million decrease in margin in northern Maine. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.4 million increase in margin in Michigan, a $2.8 million increase in margin in New York, and positive margin contributions from retail electric operations in Texas and Illinois. Integrys Energy Services retail electric aggregation sales in Ohio ended on December 31, 2005, with the expiration of Integrys Energy Services contracts with Ohio aggregation customers. The decrease in margin from operations in northern Maine was driven by higher supply costs in part tied to diesel fuel prices. A portion of the electricity purchased by Integrys Energy Services to supply customers in northern Maine is derived from burning wood chips. The cost to transport wood chips, as well as the operating costs of the machine utilized to make the wood chips, were negatively impacted by higher diesel fuel prices. In 2006, Integrys Energy Services shared in this diesel fuel exposure with the generation supplier. The increase in margin from retail electric operations in Michigan was driven by the elimination of the Seams Elimination Charge Adjustment (SECA) effective March 31, 2006. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information related to SECA. Integrys Energy Services began developing a product offering in the Texas retail electric market in 2005 and started to deliver power to these 45 customers in July 2006. In 2006, Integrys Energy Services began offering retail electric products to large commercial and industrial customers in Illinois. In 2005, Integrys Energy Services was only offering natural gas products and energy management services to customers in Illinois. All other wholesale electric operations As part of its trading activities, Integrys Energy Services seeks to generate profits from the volatility of the price of electricity by purchasing or selling various financial and physical instruments (such as forward contracts, options, financial transmission rights, and capacity contracts) in established wholesale markets where Integrys Energy Services has market expertise, under risk management policies set by management and approved by Integrys Energy Groups Board of Directors. Integrys Energy Services also seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and customer supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments (such as forward contracts, options, financial transmission rights, and capacity contracts). Period by period variability in the margin contributed by Integrys Energy Services optimization strategies and trading activities is expected due to changing market conditions and differences in the timing of gains and losses recognized on derivative and non derivative contracts, as required by generally accepted accounting principles. A diverse mix of products and markets, combined with disciplined execution and exit strategies, has allowed Integrys Energy Services to generate economic value and earnings from these activities while staying within the value at risk (VaR) limits authorized by Integrys Energy Groups Board of Directors. For more information on VaR, see "Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." Integrys Energy Services margin from all other wholesale electric operations increased $3.9 million from 2006 to 2007, driven by an increase in net realized and unrealized gains (primarily unrealized gains) related to trading activities utilized to optimize the value of Integrys Energy Services merchant generation fleet and energy contract portfolios. Partially offsetting the increase resulting from realized and unrealized gains, the overall level of proprietary trading was less in 2007, due primarily to a decrease in electric price volatility during the first three quarters of 2007, increased emphasis on structured electric transactions in 2007, and the departure of several key traders in the third quarter of 2006. Proprietary trading started picking up again in the fourth quarter of 2007 as electric price volatility increased. Integrys Energy Services used the 2006 departure of several of its traders as an opportunity to restructure trading operations into two groups. Its East trading group was relocated from Washington D.C. to Chicago and the West trading group is located in Denver. The restructured trading operations allow Integrys Energy Services to more effectively service customers in the West by providing better diversification of trading talent, market expertise, and product offerings. Integrys Energy Services margin from all other wholesale electric operations increased $4.8 million from 2005 to 2006, driven by an increase in net realized and unrealized gains related to trading activities utilized to optimize the value of Integrys Energy Services merchant generation fleet and energy contract portfolios. 46 Oil option activity Oil option activity drove a $22.0 million increase in electric and other margins from 2006 to 2007. The oil options were utilized to protect the value of a portion of Integrys Energy Services Section 29/45K federal tax credits from 2005 to 2007. However, companies are no longer allowed to generate tax credits from the production of synthetic fuel as this program ended effective December 31, 2007. Therefore, Integrys Energy Services exercised substantially all of its remaining oil options in 2007. Net mark to market and realized losses on oil options of $2.4 million were recognized in 2006, compared with net mark to market and realized gains on oil options of $19.6 million in 2007. These derivative instruments were not designated as hedging instruments and, as a result, changes in the fair value were recorded in earnings. The increase in the fair value of these instruments in 2007 over 2006 reflects increased oil prices. Oil option activity drove an $11.1 million decrease in electric and other margins from 2005 to 2006. The decrease was driven by a decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized to protect the value of a portion of Integrys Energy Services Section 29/45K federal tax credits from 2005 to 2006. This decrease is a result of net mark to market and realized losses on oil options of $2.4 million in 2006, compared with net mark to market and realized gains on oil options of $8.7 million in 2005. Retail mark to market activity Earnings volatility from this activity results from the application of derivative accounting rules to customer supply contracts (requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market), without a corresponding mark to market offset related to the customer sales contracts, which are not considered derivative instruments. These mark to market gains and losses will vary each period, and ultimately reverse as the related customer sales contracts settle. As a result, Integrys Energy Services generally experiences mark to market losses on supply contracts in periods of declining wholesale prices and mark to market gains in periods of increasing wholesale prices. Results from retail mark to market activity increased $45.3 million from $18.5 million of unrealized losses in 2006 to $26.8 million of unrealized gains in 2007. Results from retail mark to market activity decreased $27.3 million from 2005 to 2006. 2005 liquidation of electric supply contract In the fourth quarter of 2005, an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in Maine requested that Integrys Energy Services liquidate a firm contract to buy power in 2006 and 2007. At that time, Integrys Energy Services recognized an $8.2 million gain related to the liquidation of the contract and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in 2006 and 2007 to supply its customers in Maine. The cost to purchase power under the new contract was more than the cost under the liquidated contract. The liquidation and subsequent replacement of this contract resulted in the following: A $5.5 million increase in margins from 2006 to 2007. The replacement contract increased the cost of purchased power needed to serve customers in Maine by $6.4 million in 2006, compared with $0.9 million in 2007. A $14.6 million negative impact on the 2006 electric and other margin, as a result of higher purchased power costs recorded under the new contract of $6.4 million compared with an $8.2 million gain recognized on the liquidation of the original contract in 2005. 47 Natural Gas Margins Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins increased $18.6 million from 2006 to 2007 and increased $59.6 million from 2005 to 2006. The 2007 natural gas margins included the negative impact of $6.1 million of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the merger with PEC. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins. Realized natural gas margins Realized natural gas margins increased $8.0 million, from $92.6 million in 2006, to $100.6 million in 2007. The majority of this increase, $5.7 million, was driven by margin contributed by the nonregulated retail natural gas marketing operations of PEC and improved supply optimization, as Integrys Energy Services was able to secure lower supply costs for firm sales commitments to retail natural gas customers in Ohio and Illinois. The remaining increase in realized natural gas margins was driven by the nonregulated wholesale natural gas marketing operations added with the PEC merger. Realized natural gas margins increased $32.2 million, from $60.4 million in 2005, to $92.6 million in 2006. The majority of this increase, $26.6 million, related to an increase in retail natural gas margin, driven by continued expansion of Integrys Energy Services Canadian retail operations (including higher sales volumes to existing customers as well as new customer additions). Margins from retail natural gas operations in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois also increased, as Integrys Energy Services was able to better manage supply to these customers, aided by favorable market conditions. The remaining $5.6 million increase in realized natural gas margins related to wholesale operations, driven by an increase in structured wholesale natural gas transactions attributed to an increase in the volatility of the price of natural gas as well as high natural gas storage spreads during most of 2006. Mass market supply options Options utilized to manage supply costs for mass market customers are used to reduce the risk of price movements, customer migration, and changes in consumer consumption patterns. Earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the options (requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market), without a corresponding mark to market offset related to the customer contracts. Full requirements natural gas contracts with Integrys Energy Services customers are not considered derivatives and, therefore, no gain or loss is recognized on these contracts until settlement. The option mark to market gains and losses will reverse as the related customer sales contracts settle. In 2007, options utilized to manage supply costs for mass market customers drove a $6.6 million increase in Integrys Energy Services natural gas margin. These options had a $1.1 million positive impact on margin in 2007 (commensurate with higher natural gas prices), compared with a negative $5.5 million impact on margin in 2006 (commensurate with declining natural gas prices). In 2006, options utilized to manage supply costs for mass market customers drove an $8.4 million decrease in Integrys Energy Services natural gas margin. These options had a $5.5 million negative impact on Integrys Energy Services natural gas margin in 2006 (commensurate with declining natural gas prices), compared with a $2.9 million positive impact on margin in 2005 (commensurate with higher natural gas prices in the latter half of 2005). Spot to forward differential Integrys Energy Services experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle, which runs annually from April through March of the next year. Generally, injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months. Integrys Energy Services policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with 48 contracts in the over the counter and futures markets, effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage. However, fair market value hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices, while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices. When the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas, Integrys Energy Services experiences volatility in its earnings. Consequently, earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage. The accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions. The natural gas storage cycle had a negative $0.2 million impact on natural gas margins from 2006 to 2007. There was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in 2007 compared with a $0.2 million positive impact in 2006. At December 31, 2007, the market value of natural gas in storage was $5.6 million less than the market value of future sales contracts (net unrealized loss), related to the 2007/2008 natural gas storage cycle. This $5.6 million difference is expected to vary with market conditions, and will reverse entirely and have a positive impact on earnings when all of the natural gas is withdrawn from storage. The natural gas storage cycle had a positive $5.4 million impact on natural gas margins from 2005 to 2006. In 2006, the natural gas storage cycle had a positive $0.2 million impact on margin, compared with a $5.2 million negative impact on margin in 2005. Other mark to market activity Other mark to market activity primarily relates to changes in the fair market value of basis swaps utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with natural gas transportation contracts and certain natural gas sales contracts as well as contracts utilized to mitigate market price risk related to certain natural gas storage contracts. Earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the basis and other swaps (requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market), without a corresponding mark to market offset related to the physical natural gas transportation contracts, the natural gas sales contracts, or the natural gas storage contracts (as these contracts are not considered derivative instruments). Therefore, no gain or loss is recognized on the transportation contracts, customer sales contracts, or natural gas storage contracts until physical settlement of these contracts occurs. Derivative instruments not previously discussed drove a $4.2 million increase in the natural gas margins as mark to market gains on these instruments increased to $37.5 million in 2007. Derivative instruments not previously discussed drove a $30.4 increase in the natural gas margins as mark to market gains on these instruments increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Operating Income 2007 Compared with 2006: Operating income at Integrys Energy Services increased $40.2 million, driven by the $123.0 million increase in margin discussed above, partially offset by a $77.9 million increase in operating and maintenance expense and a $5.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by higher payroll and benefit costs related to additional employees required as a result of continued business expansion activities at Integrys Energy Services (the most significant of which related to the merger of PECs nonregulated operation into Integrys Energy Services). A $9.0 million pre tax gain on the 2006 sale of WPS ESI Gas Storage, LLC, $7.7 million of costs to achieve merger synergies and additional costs related to plant outages of $2.6 million in 2007 also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expense. 49 2006 compared with 2005: Operating income at Integrys Energy Services increased $20.5 million, driven by the $14.8 million increase in margin discussed above and a $7.4 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense. The decrease in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to a $9.0 million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of WPS ESI Gas Storage, LLC in the second quarter of 2006. This gain was partially offset by higher payroll and benefit costs related to an increase in the number of employees as a result of business expansion activities. Holding Company and Other Segment Operations 2007 Compared with 2006: Financial results at the Holding Company and Other segment decreased $19.1 million, from net income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, to a net loss of $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The change was driven by the following: A $42.0 million ($25.2 million after tax) increase in interest expense, driven by additional borrowings assumed in the merger with PEC, as well as an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota, higher working capital requirements at Integrys Energy Services, and transaction and transition costs related to the merger with PEC. A $6.2 million ($3.7 million after tax) gain on the sale of Integrys Energy Groups one third interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC in April 2006 also contributed to the decrease in year over year earnings. An $11.5 million increase in pre tax earnings ($6.9 million after tax) from Integrys Energy Groups 34.5% ownership interest in ATC. Integrys Energy Group recorded $50.5 million of pre tax equity earnings from ATC during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $39.0 million for the same period in 2006. A $1.7 million ($1.0 million after tax) decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, primarily related to the reallocation of external costs to achieve merger synergies associated with the PEC merger, incurred from July 2006 through March 2007. In March 2007, all external costs to achieve were reallocated from the Holding Company and Other segment (where they were initially recorded) to other reportable segments, which will ultimately be the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve. 2006 Compared with 2005: Earnings at the Holding Company and Other segment decreased $5.6 million, from net income of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, to a net income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The changes were driven by the following: A $12.9 million increase in interest expense, net of intercompany interest income ($7.7 million after taxes) Higher interest expense was driven by an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota and working capital requirements at Integrys Energy Services. A $9.2 million increase in operating and maintenance expense ($5.5 million after taxes). The increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by legal and consulting expenses related to business expansion activities, primarily attributed to the merger with PEC. A $4.8 million year over year decrease in after tax gains from land sales. 50 A $13.9 million increase in pre tax earnings ($8.3 million after tax) from ATC (pre tax equity earnings from ATC increased to $39.0 million in 2006, from $25.1 million in 2005). A $6.2 million ($3.7 million after tax) gain recognized from the 2006 sale of Integrys Energy Groups one third interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC. Summary of External Costs to Achieve Below is a table depicting the pre tax impact that external costs to achieve had on each reportable segment of Integrys Energy Group during the year ended December 31, 2007. Note that external costs to achieve incurred at the holding company in 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 were reallocated down to the segment level in the first quarter of 2007. Reportable Segment (millions) 2007 Pre tax Impact (Income)/Expense Electric utility $ 12.3 Natural gas utility 4.5 Integrys Energy Services 7.7 Holding company and other (6.8 ) Total $ 17.7 Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Change 2007 over 2006 Change 2006 over 2005 Miscellaneous income $ 64.1 $ 42.8 $ 88.8 49.8 % (51.8 %) Interest expense (164.5 ) (99.2 ) (62.0 ) 65.8 % 60.0 % Minority interest 0.1 3.8 4.5 (97.4 %) (15.6 %) Other (expense) income $ (100.3 ) $ (52.6 ) $ 31.3 90.7 % Miscellaneous Income 2007 Compared with 2006: The $21.3 million increase in miscellaneous income was primarily driven by: An $11.5 million increase in pre tax equity earnings from Integrys Energy Groups 34.5% ownership interest in ATC. A $5.7 million decrease in pre tax losses recognized for the year related to Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility. Integrys Energy Services took less production from this facility in 2007 compared with 2006. A $3.8 million increase in foreign currency gains at Integrys Energy Services Canadian subsidiaries, which was offset by related losses in gross margin. These transactions are substantially hedged from an economic perspective, resulting in no significant impact on income (loss) available for common shareholders. An increase of $2.9 million, partially due to an increase in interest income recognized related to the transmission facilities WPSC is funding on ATCs behalf pending the start up of Weston 4. A decrease due to the $6.2 million pre tax gain recognized from the sale of Integrys Energy Groups one third interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC in the second quarter of 2006. 51 2006 Compared with 2005: Miscellaneous income decreased $46.0 million driven primarily by: Approximately $41 million of realized gains on nuclear decommissioning trust assets recorded during the year ended December 31, 2005. Pursuant to regulatory practice, the increase in miscellaneous income related to these realized gains was offset by a corresponding increase in decommissioning expense in 2005. Integrys Energy Services equity investment in a synthetic fuel facility contributed an additional $11.3 million decrease in miscellaneous income, driven in part by additional synthetic fuel production procured in 2006 from our partners in this facility. Pre tax gains recognized on land sales decreased $8.0 million, from $10.3 million in 2005 to $2.3 million in 2006. These decreases were partially offset by a $13.9 million increase in pre tax equity earnings from ATC and a $6.2 million pre tax gain recognized from the sale of Integrys Energy Groups one third interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC. Interest Expense 2007 Compared with 2006: Interest expense increased $65.3 million as a result of: Interest expense of $30.3 million recorded at PGL and NSG from February 22, 2007 through December 31, 2007. The remaining increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota, higher working capital requirements at Integrys Energy Services, and transaction and transition costs related to the merger with PEC. 2006 Compared with 2005: Interest expense increased $37.2 million due primarily to: An increase in the average amount of both short term and long term debt outstanding and higher average short term interest rates. During 2006, borrowings were primarily utilized to fund the purchase of natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota, the construction of Weston 4, and for working capital requirements at Integrys Energy Services. Minority Interest 2007 Compared with 2006: A decrease of $3.7 million in minority interest related to Integrys Energy Services synthetic fuel operations. In 2007, Integrys Energy Services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and, therefore, did not share in losses from this facility. 52 2006 Compared with 2005: Minority interest related to Integrys Energy Services synthetic fuel operation did not significantly change for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Effective Tax Rate 32.2 % 22.9 % 20.8 % The 2007 increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a decrease in Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized in 2007 compared with 2006. The decrease in Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized was driven by the impact of high oil prices on our ability to realize the benefit of Section 29/45K federal tax credits. Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized from the production and sale of synthetic fuel were $13.6 million in 2007, compared with $29.5 million in 2006. The 2006 increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a higher effective state tax rate, primarily related to the acquisition of regulated natural gas operations in Minnesota and also due to a loss in value of various state net operating loss carryforwards. Section 29/45K federal tax credits from the production and sale of synthetic fuel increased $3.4 million to $29.5 million in 2006, to partially offset the increase in effective tax rate. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 2007 Compared with 2006: Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $66.0 million, from after tax income of $7.3 million in 2006 to after tax income of $73.3 million in 2007. In September 2007, Integrys Energy Group completed the sale of PEP for approximately $879.1 million. Post closing adjustments in the amount of $9.9 million were settled in February 2008 related to this sale, which reduced the sale price to $869.2 million. These post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, $58.5 million of income from discontinued operations was recognized related to PEP, which included an after tax gain of $7.6 million on the sale. Discontinued operations, net of tax, related to WPS Niagara Generation, LLC (Niagara), which was sold in January 2007, increased $14.4 million, from income of $0.4 million in 2006 to income of $14.8 million in 2007. The increase in income generated from Niagara was mostly due to a $14.7 million after tax gain on the sale of the facility. Partially offsetting these increases were discontinued operations related to Sunbury Generation, LLC (Sunbury). Income from discontinued operations related to Sunbury was $6.9 million for the period January 1, 2006, through the date of sale in July 2006, including a $12.5 million after tax gain on the sale of this facility. 2006 Compared with 2005: Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $4.2 million, from after tax income of $11.5 million in 2005 to after tax income of $7.3 million in 2006. Discontinued operations, net of tax, related to Sunbury decreased $2.2 million, from income of $9.1 million in 2005, to income of $6.9 million in 2006. The $6.9 million of income recorded in 2006 included a $12.5 million after tax gain on the sale of Sunbury, which was sold in July 2006. 53 Discontinued operations, net of tax, related to WPS Niagara Generation, LLC decreased $2.0 million, from income of $2.4 million in 2005 to income of $0.4 million in 2006. The decrease in income generated from WPS Niagara Generation was mostly due to a decrease in the average price per megawatt sold from this facility in 2006 compared to 2005. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principles 2006 compared with 2005: In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations." This Interpretation clarifies when companies are required to recognize conditional legal asset retirement obligations that result from the acquisition, construction, and normal operation of a long lived asset. Because the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations had been interpreted differently between companies, SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," had been inconsistently applied in practice. The adoption of Interpretation No. 47 at Integrys Energy Services on December 31, 2005, resulted in a negative $1.6 million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, related to recording a liability for asbestos remediation at certain of Integrys Energy Services generation plants. For the utility segments of Integrys Energy Group, we concluded it was probable that any differences between expenses under Interpretation No. 47 and expenses currently recovered through customer rates will be recoverable in future customer rates. Accordingly, the adoption of this statement had no impact on the utility segments income. BALANCE SHEET Net accounts receivable increased $368.0 million (35.5%), from $1,037.3 million at December 31, 2006, to $1,405.3 million at December 31, 2007, primarily due to the following: At December 31, 2007, PGL and NSG had a net accounts receivable balance of $196.0 million. Net accounts receivable at Integrys Energy Services increased $83.5 million, driven primarily by the integration of PECs nonregulated business into Integrys Energy Services, as well as continued growth in Integrys Energy Services business in 2007. Net accounts receivable at WPSC increased $84.7 million (49.8%), primarily due to an $82.3 million receivable from ATC pertaining to transmission facilities required to support Weston 4 that WPSC is funding on their behalf pending completion of Weston 4. At December 31, 2006, the amount owed to WPSC by ATC was $20.8 million and was included as a component of other long term assets. At December 31, 2007, the $20.8 million was reflected as a receivable from ATC as was the $61.5 million of incremental funding that was incurred in 2007. Accrued unbilled revenues increased $279.9 million (151.5%), from $184.8 million at December 31, 2006, to $464.7 million at December 31, 2007, primarily driven by combined accrued unbilled revenues of $155.1 million at PGL and NSG at December 31, 2007. Accrued unbilled revenues at Integrys Energy Services also increased $108.9 million, driven by the integration of PECs nonregulated business into Integrys Energy Services, as well as continued growth in Integrys Energy Services business in 2007. Inventories increased $207.1 million (45.4%), from $456.3 million at December 31, 2006, to $663.4 million at December 31, 2007. The inventory balance at Integrys Energy Services increased $139.9 million (48.6%), due to the addition of PECs nonregulated business as well as an increase in storage volumes related to continued growth of Integrys Energy Services natural gas business in new and existing markets. The inventory balance at PGL and NSG was $93.8 million at December 31, 2007. 54 At December 31, 2007, compared to December 31, 2006, total assets from risk management activities decreased $76.8 million (5.6%) and total liabilities from risk management activities decreased $80.9 million (6.4%). The decrease in assets and liabilities from risk management activities was driven by timing of mark to market gain and loss recognition on the underlying contracts. Although total risk management assets and liabilities decreased, long term risk management assets and liabilities increased at December 31, 2007, compared to December 31, 2006. This increase related to more emphasis on structured origination contracts, which are physical, customer based agreements with municipalities, merchant generators, and regulated utilities, and are generally longer term in nature. Total regulatory assets increased $805.2 million (183.5%), from $438.8 million at December 31, 2006, to $1,244.0 million at December 31, 2007, primarily attributed to a $656.1 million increase in the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs and a $63.2 million increase in the regulatory asset for pension and post retirement benefit related items. The increase in the environmental related regulatory asset related to estimated costs of future natural gas remediation for several manufactured gas plant sites at PGL and NSG. See Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information. The increase in the regulatory asset related to pension and postretirement benefit related items was driven by the merger with PEC and changes Integrys Energy Group made to certain of its retirement benefit plans. See Note 19, "Employee Benefit Plans," for more information. Net property, plant, and equipment increased $1,929.0 million (76.1%), from $2,534.8 million at December 31, 2006, to $4,463.8 million at December 31, 2007, due primarily to the following: Net property, plant, and equipment related to PGL and NSG at December 31, 2007 was $1,788.6 million. Net property, plant, and equipment at WPSC increased $106.0 million. WPSCs capital expenditures in 2007 were $221.1 million, in part due to $100.3 million of capital expenditures related to the construction of Weston 4 and the purchase of unit trains for this facility, partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $96.4 million in 2007. The $644.0 million (212.0%) increase in goodwill from December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2007, is primarily related to goodwill recorded in conjunction with the PEC merger. See Note 11, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for more information. The change in pension and post retirement assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was driven by the PEC merger as well as changes Integrys Energy Group made to certain of its retirement benefit plans, as well as changes made to the assumptions used to measure these plans at December 31, 2007, compared with December 31, 2006. See Note 19, "Employee Benefit Plans," for more information. Detailed explanations for changes in the short term and long term debt balances at December 31, 2007, compared to December 31, 2006, are included in Note 13, "Short term Debt and Lines of Credit," and Note 14, "Long Term Debt." Accounts payable increased $382.4 million (40.3%), from $949.4 million at December 31, 2006, to $1,331.8 million at December 31, 2007. Accounts payable recorded at PGL and NSG at December 31, 2007 was $197.0 million. Accounts payable at Integrys Energy Services increased $177.8 million, driven by the addition of PECs nonregulated business ($120.6 million of accounts payable related to PECs nonregulated operations was assumed on the merger date). Accounts payable at Integrys Energy Services also increased as a result of an increase in natural gas purchases in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with the same quarter of 2006, due to general business growth. Other current liabilities increased $304.0 million (168.8%), from $180.1 million at December 31, 2006, to $484.1 million at December 31, 2007, primarily due to an increase in liabilities related to vacation, salaries, and other general expenses related to the PEC merger. 55 Environmental remediation liabilities increased $609.8 million (636.5%), from $95.8 million at December 31, 2006, to $705.6 million at December 31, 2007. The increase related to estimated costs of future natural gas remediation for several manufactured gas plant sites at PGL and NSG. PGL and NSG anticipate that natural gas plant site remediation costs will be collected in rates; therefore, an offsetting regulatory asset has been recorded. See Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We believe that our cash balances, liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity made available because of strong credit ratings, when taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control. In addition, our borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. Currently, we believe our ratings are among the best in the energy industry (see "Financing Cash Flows Credit Ratings" below). Operating Cash Flows During 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $238.5 million, compared with $72.9 million in 2006. The $165.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a $84.0 million decrease in working capital requirements year over year. It is important to note that changes in working capital balances at February 21, 2007, as a result of the PEC merger are not incorporated in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as the merger was a noncash transaction. Only PEC changes in working capital from the merger date to December 31, 2007 are included. Inventory levels at Integrys Energy Services increased from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, but this change was less than the increase from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006, driving the majority of the decrease in working capital requirements. Integrys Energy Services continued to see growth in its natural gas business in both new and existing markets. The year over year change in natural gas inventories at the regulated utilities was not significant. The remaining increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a year over year increase in income available for common shareholders. During 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $72.9 million, compared with $77.4 million in 2005. The $4.5 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by an $88.2 million increase in cash required to fund working capital requirements, primarily due to an increase in natural gas inventories at Integrys Energy Services. Natural gas in storage at Integrys Energy Services increased $85.2 million primarily related to a 121% increase in natural gas volumes in storage at December 31, 2006, compared to December 31, 2005 (partially offset by a 20% decrease in the average cost of inventory in storage). Integrys Energy Services chose to purchase more natural gas for storage due to high natural gas storage spreads (future natural gas sales prices were higher than the near term price of natural gas). The increase in cash used to fund higher Integrys Energy Services natural gas inventories was partially offset at the regulated utilities by cash used to fund costs incurred in 2005 related to the unplanned outage at Kewaunee, the start up of MISO, and coal shortages. Investing Cash Flows Net cash used for investing activities was $451.5 million in 2007, compared with $1,030.1 million in 2006. The $578.6 million decrease was driven by $659.3 million of cash used by Integrys Energy Group to acquire natural gas operations in Michigan and Minnesota in 2006. Also contributing $44.0 million to the decrease in net cash used for investing activities in 2007 was WPSCs liquidation of the cash that was deposited into an escrow account in 2006, which was used for the payment of the outstanding principal balance of first mortgage bonds in January 2007 (discussed below in significant financing activities). Partially offsetting these decreases were $58.4 million of proceeds received from the sale of our 56 investment in Guardian Pipeline LLC and WPS ESI Gas Storage, LLC in 2006 and a $50.6 million year over year increase in capital expenditures (discussed below). Net cash used for investing activities was $1,030.1 million in 2006, compared with $148.8 million in 2005. The $881.3 million year over year increase was primarily due to $659.3 million of cash paid in 2006 for the acquisition of the Michigan and Minnesota natural gas distribution operations from Aquila, $112.5 million of proceeds received in 2005 related to the sale of Kewaunee, $127.1 million of proceeds received in 2005 from the liquidation of the related non qualified decommissioning trust, and $95.1 million of proceeds received in 2005 from DPC upon closing of the sale of a 30% ownership interest in Weston 4. Also contributing to the increase was $22.0 million of cash deposited into an escrow account in 2006 for the payment of the outstanding principal balance of first mortgage bonds in January 2007. Partially offsetting the increase in cash used for investing activities was a $71.9 million decrease in capital expenditures (discussed below), proceeds of $38.5 million received in 2006 from the sale of the companys one third interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC, and proceeds of $19.9 million received in 2006 from the sale of WPS ESI Gas Storage, LLC. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 were as follows: Years Ended December 31, Reportable Segment (millions) 2007 2006 2005 Electric utility $ 202.6 $ 282.1 $ 373.9 Natural gas utility 158.8 54.6 36.4 Integrys Energy Services 20.5 5.5 2.7 Holding company and other 10.7 (0.2 ) 0.9 Integrys Energy Group consolidated $ 392.6 $ 342.0 $ 413.9 The decrease in capital expenditures at the electric utility in 2007 compared with 2006 was mainly due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the construction of Weston 4. The increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility was primarily driven by capital requirements of PGL and NSG, which were acquired in the merger with PEC on February 21, 2007. Capital expenditures in 2007 for PGL and NSG related mainly to the natural gas distribution systems. The increase in capital expenditures at Integrys Energy Services was due to capital required to open new offices in Colorado, Michigan, and Washington, D.C., as well as to move the Chicago office; improvements at various generation facilities; new systems infrastructure; and the Winnebago Energy Center landfill gas project. The increase in capital expenditures at the Holding Company and Other segment was driven by the purchase of a corporate airplane. The decrease in capital expenditures at the electric utility in 2006 compared with 2005 was mainly due to lower capital expenditures associated with the construction of Weston 4. The increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility was related to a combined $20.1 million of capital expenditures incurred by MGUC and MERC for natural gas mains. Financing Cash Flows Net cash used for financing activities was $459.2 million in 2007, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $891.7 million in 2006. The $1.4 billion change was driven by $458.0 million of short term debt borrowings during 2006, compared with the repayment of $463.7 million of short term debt in 2007. In 2007, Integrys Energy Group was able to pay down short term debt with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of PEP. The remaining net change in financing activity was driven by a $321.8 million decrease in long term debt issuances year over year and a $119.0 million year over year decrease in common stock issued. Short term borrowings in 2006 and the long term debt and stock 57 issuances in 2006 were used primarily for the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota. An $81.0 million increase in dividends paid in 2007, compared with 2006, was driven by an increase in shares outstanding and higher dividend rates. These items were partially offset by natural gas loan proceeds at Integrys Energy Services of $34.4 million in 2007, compared with repayment of $68.4 million of natural gas loans during 2006. An increase in natural gas spreads made it more conducive to enter into natural gas loan deals in 2007 compared with 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities was $891.7 million in 2006, compared with net cash related to financing activities of $0 in 2005. The change was primarily attributed to a $458.0 million increase in short term debt and the issuance of $447.0 million of long term debt in 2006. Increased borrowings were used primarily for the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota, construction expenditures related to Weston 4, working capital requirements at Integrys Energy Services, and other general corporate purposes. Significant Financing Activities Dividends paid increased in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of the merger with PEC. Integrys Energy Group issued 31.9 million shares of common stock as part of the merger and increased the dividend paid per share. The quarterly common stock dividend was increased from 57.5 cents per share to 66 cents per share in 2007. In February 2008, Integrys Energy Group increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 67 cents per share. Integrys Energy Group had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $308.2 million and $562.8 million at December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Integrys Energy Group had other outstanding short term debt of $160.0 million as of December 31, 2007, and 2006. In April 2006, Integrys Energy Services entered into a $150.0 million credit agreement, which has been renewed to April 2008, to finance its margin requirements related to natural gas and electric contracts traded on the NYMEX and the ICE, as well as the cost of natural gas in storage and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $150.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under this credit agreement, which is guaranteed by Integrys Energy Group. In 2007, 2006, and 2005 Integrys Energy Group issued new shares of common stock under its Stock Investment Plan and under certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. As a result of these plans, equity increased $45.7 million, $25.0 million, and $29.0 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Integrys Energy Group did not repurchase any existing common stock during 2007, 2006, or 2005. In November 2007, WPSC issued $125.0 million of 5.65%, 10 year senior notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to fund construction costs and capital additions, reduce short term indebtedness, as well as for general corporate utility purposes. On December 14, 2006, the Village of Weston, Wisconsin, issued $22.0 million of 3.95% Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to WPSC. In return, WPSC issued $22.0 million of 3.95% senior notes, due in 2013, to the Village of Weston. At December 31, 2006, the $22.0 million of proceeds received from the Village of Weston were classified as restricted cash. In January 2007, WPSC used the restricted cash to repay the outstanding principal balance of its 6.90% first mortgage bonds which originally were to mature in 2013. In December 2006, WPSC issued $125.0 million of 5.55% 30 year senior notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used for general corporate utility purposes, including funding construction costs and capital additions and reducing short term indebtedness. On December 1, 2006, Integrys Energy Group issued $300.0 million of junior subordinated notes. Interest has been fixed at 6.22% through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps. For more information on the junior subordinated notes, see Note 14, "Long Term Debt." 58 In November 2005, Integrys Energy Group entered into a forward equity sale agreement with an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., as forward purchaser, relating to 2.7 million shares of Integrys Energy Groups common stock. On May 10, 2006, Integrys Energy Group physically settled the forward equity agreement by issuing 2.7 million shares of common stock, and received proceeds of $139.6 million. The proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper borrowings. In November 2005, Integrys Energy Group issued and sold 1.9 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $53.70 per share. The proceeds of $98.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, were used to reduce short term debt and fund equity contributions to subsidiary companies. In June 2005, $62.9 million of non recourse debt at an Integrys Energy Services subsidiary that was used to finance the purchase of Sunbury was restructured to a five year Integrys Energy Group obligation in connection with the sale of Sunburys allocated emission allowances. An additional $2.7 million drawn on a line of credit at Integrys Energy Services was rolled into the five year Integrys Energy Group obligation. The floating interest rate on the total five year Integrys Energy Group obligation of $65.6 million was fixed at 4.595% through two interest rate swaps. Credit Ratings Integrys Energy Group uses internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowings to satisfy most of its capital requirements. Integrys Energy Group also periodically issues long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. Integrys Energy Group may seek nonrecourse financing for funding nonregulated acquisitions. Integrys Energy Groups commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses, PEC, UPPCO, MGUC, and MERC. WPSC and PGL have their own commercial paper borrowing programs. NSG provides for its working capital needs through inter company borrowings. WPSC periodically issues long term debt, receives equity contributions from Integrys Energy Group, and makes payments for returns of capital to Integrys Energy Group to reduce short term debt, fund future growth, and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the PSCW. PGL and NSG periodically issue long term debt in order to reduce short term debt, refinance maturing securities, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. The specific forms of long term financing, amounts, and timing depend on business needs, market conditions, and other factors. 59 The current credit ratings for Integrys Energy Group, WPSC, PEC, PGL, and NSG are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys Integrys Energy Group Issuer credit rating Senior unsecured debt Commercial paper Credit facility Junior subordinated notes A BBB+ A 2 n/a BBB n/a A3 P 2 A3 Baa1 WPSC Issuer credit rating First mortgage bonds Senior secured debt Preferred stock Commercial paper Credit facility A A+ A BBB+ A 2 n/a A1 Aa3 Aa3 A3 P 1 A1 PEC Issuer credit rating Senior unsecured debt A BBB+ n/a A3 PGL Issuer credit rating Senior secured debt Commercial paper A A A 2 n/a A1 P 1 NSG Issuer credit rating Senior secured debt A A n/a A1 We believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy and are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In December 2007, Standard & Poors and Moodys withdrew the ratings assigned to PECs commercial paper at the request of Integrys Energy Group. On November 13, 2007, Standard & Poors revised the outlook on Integrys Energy Group and all of its subsidiaries to stable from negative. Standard & Poors outlook had been negative since February 21, 2007 for all Integrys Energy Group companies, as discussed below. The revised outlook reflects Integrys Energy Groups progress to improve its financial position and business profiles since its one notch downgrade on February 21, 2007. On November 13, 2007, Standard & Poors also reaffirmed its A rating on WPSCs senior secured debt. On September 6, 2007, Standard & Poors raised the senior secured debt for NSG one notch from A to A. The new rating was the result of a review and changes made to the collateral coverage requirements Standard and Poors uses when assigning recovery ratings to United States Utility First Mortgage Bonds. On February 21, 2007, Standard & Poors lowered the corporate credit rating on Integrys Energy Group to A from A and removed it from CreditWatch with negative implications. Standard & Poors also lowered Integrys Energy Groups unsecured ratings to BBB+ from A and all other issue specific ratings by one notch. Standard & Poors stated that the ratings actions were due to concerns related to plans to expand its energy marketing business, the dividend requirements resulting from the PEC merger, moderate capital expenditure requirements, lower than expected performance at MGUC and MERC, uncertainty regarding future rate relief, and full integration of the newly acquired PEC utilities. At the same time, Standard & Poors lowered all WPSCs issue specific ratings by one notch as they stated "WPSCs liquidity is being pressured by its ongoing construction program." Standard & Poors affirmed all PEC, 60 PGL, and NSG ratings. Standard & Poors outlook for all Integrys Energy Group related companies was negative pending successful integration of recent acquisitions. On February 21, 2007, Moodys downgraded the senior unsecured rating of Integrys Energy Group to A3 from A1, the bank credit facility to A3 from A1, the commercial paper rating to Prime 2 from Prime 1, and the junior subordinated notes to Baa1 from A2. Moodys also downgraded WPSCs senior secured rating to Aa3 from Aa2, its senior unsecured bank credit facility to A1 from Aa3, and its preferred stock to A3 from A2 and confirmed WPSCs commercial paper rating at Prime 1. At the same time, Moodys affirmed the ratings of PGL and NSG. Moodys actions to downgrade were due to concerns about increases in Integrys Energy Groups consolidated debt levels and business risk profile evidenced by the increased scale and scope of the post merger non regulated energy marketing business plus the entry into the historically more challenging regulatory jurisdiction of Illinois. Moodys outlook for all Integrys Energy Group related companies is stable. On February 21, 2007, Moodys also upgraded the senior unsecured rating of PEC to A3 from Baa2, conforming it with those of Integrys Energy Group, and affirmed all other ratings for PEC. Moodys actions to upgrade the senior unsecured rating were due to the expected business risk improvement from the merger with Integrys Energy Group, which resulted in the sale of PEP and transferred PECs energy and marketing business to Integrys Energy Services, leaving PEC holding only the two regulated subsidiaries, PGL and NSG. In addition, the upgrade reflects Integrys Energy Groups guaranty of the $325.0 million of PEC 6.90% notes due in 2011. Discontinued Operations Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $690.2 million in 2007 and $61.0 million in 2006. The increase in net cash provided by discontinued operations was driven by approximately $879.1 million of proceeds received from the sale of PEP in the third quarter of 2007. Post closing adjustments in the amount of $9.9 million were settled in February 2008 related to this sale, which reduced the sale price to $869.2 million. These post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at December 31, 2007 and, therefore, are included in Note 1(d), "Cash and Cash Equivalents," as a non cash transaction. Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $61.0 million in 2006 and $59.1 million in 2005. The increase in cash provided by discontinued operations in 2006 was driven by a decrease in cash paid for emission allowances required to operate Sunbury in 2006, compared with 2005 (substantially all of the emission allowances required to operate Sunbury through the 2006 sale were purchased in 2005), and by the $33.6 million of proceeds received from the sale of Sunbury in 2006. These increases were partially offset by $110.9 million of proceeds received from the sale of Sunburys allocated emission allowances in 2005 (which was partially offset by income taxes paid related to the gain on the sale of these emission allowances). 61 Future Capital Requirements and Resources Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the contractual obligations of Integrys Energy Group, including its subsidiaries. Contractual Obligations Total Payments Due By Period As of December 31, 2007 (Millions) Amounts Committed 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and Thereafter Long term debt principal and interest payments(1) $ 3,642.2 $ 186.5 $ 522.2 $ 910.6 $ 2,022.9 Operating lease obligations 43.7 8.3 13.4 12.4 9.6 Commodity purchase obligations(2) 6,986.7 3,352.6 2,102.8 784.7 746.6 Purchase orders(3) 349.1 336.1 9.4 2.5 1.1 Other (4) 379.5 72.1 79.8 40.0 187.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 11,401.2 $ 3,955.6 $ 2,727.6 $ 1,750.2 $ 2,967.8 (1) Represents bonds issued, notes issued, and loans made to Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. All principal obligations are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For purposes of this table, it is assumed that the interest rates on variable rate debt at December 31, 2007 will remain in effect until the debt matures. (2) Energy supply contracts at Integrys Energy Services included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy to customers. WPSC, UPPCO, MGUC, MERC, PGL, and NSG expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates. (3) Includes obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations, including 100% of Weston 4 obligations. The sale of a 30% interest in Weston 4 to DPC was completed in November 2005, but WPSC retains the legal obligation to initially remit payment to third parties for 100% of all construction costs incurred, 30% of which will subsequently be billed to DPC. (4) Mainly represents expected pension and postretirement funding obligations. The table above does not reflect any payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $704.2 million at December 31, 2007, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. See Note 17,"Commitments and Contingencies," for more information about environmental liabilities. Also, the table does not reflect any payments for our liability at December 31, 2007, for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 16, "Income Taxes," for more information about this liability. 62 Capital Requirements Estimated construction expenditures by company for the three year period 2008 through 2010 are as follows: (Millions) WPSC Environmental projects $ 300.4 Wind generation projects 252.0 Electric and natural gas distribution projects 223.2 Natural gas laterals to connect to Guardian pipeline 65.4 Weston 4 (1) 18.9 Other projects 131.9 UPPCO Electric distribution projects and repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 54.4 MGUC Natural gas pipe distribution system and underground natural gas storage facilities 21.9 MERC Natural gas pipe distribution system 50.1 PGL Natural gas pipe distribution system and underground natural gas storage facilities (2) 451.0 NSG Natural gas pipe distribution system 30.5 Integrys Energy Services Miscellaneous projects and landfill natural gas project 22.2 IBS Corporate services infrastructure projects 80.3 Total capital expenditures $ 1,702.2 (1) As of December 31, 2007, WPSC has incurred a total cost of approximately $516 million related to its ownership interest in the project. WPSC has incurred approximately $77 million and expects to incur an additional $16 million related to the construction of the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4. ATC will reimburse WPSC for these transmission facilities and related carrying costs (approximately $8 million in carrying costs) when Weston 4 becomes operational. Weston 4 is scheduled to be placed in service in the first quarter of 2008. (2) Includes approximately $100 million of expenditures related to the accelerated replacement of cast iron mains at PGL. The expenditures were initially included in a request for recovery in a rider to PGLs rate case; however, the ICC rejected the rider. The company is investigating alternative recovery options. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on the PGL rate case. Integrys Energy Group expects to provide additional capital contributions to ATC (not included in the above table) of approximately $47 million for the period 2008 through 2010. All projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Other capital expenditures for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries for 2008 through 2010 63 could be significant depending on its success in pursuing development and acquisition opportunities. When appropriate, Integrys Energy Group may seek nonrecourse financing for a portion of the cost of these acquisitions. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2007, Integrys Energy Group and each of its subsidiaries were in compliance with all of their respective covenants under their lines of credit and other debt obligations. For the period 2008 through 2010, Integrys Energy Group plans to use internally generated funds net of forecasted dividend payments, cash proceeds from asset sales, and debt and equity financings to fund capital requirements. Integrys Energy Group plans to maintain current debt to equity ratios at appropriate levels to support current credit ratings and corporate growth. Management believes Integrys Energy Group has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs. See Note 13, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit," for more information on our credit facilities and other short term credit agreements. In April 2006, Integrys Energy Group filed a shelf registration under the new SEC securities offering reform rules for the ability to issue debt, equity, and certain types of hybrid securities. This shelf registration statement includes the unused capacity remaining under Integrys Energy Groups prior registration statement. Specific terms and conditions of securities issued will be determined prior to the actual issuance of any specific security. Under the new SEC securities offering reform rules, Integrys Energy Group will be able to issue securities under this registration statement for three years. Integrys Energy Groups Board of Directors has authorized issuance of up to $700 million of equity, debt, or other securities under this shelf registration statement, $300 million of which was used in December 2006 when Integrys Energy Group issued junior subordinated notes. In May 2004, WPSC filed a shelf registration with the SEC authorizing the issuance of up to $350 million of senior debt securities. WPSC issued $125 million of senior debt securities under this registration statement in December 2006 and an additional $125 million of senior debt securities under this registration statement in November 2007, leaving existing capacity under the registration statement of $100 million as of December 31, 2007. Other Future Considerations Asset Management Strategy Integrys Energy Group continues to pursue alternatives for the sale of the balance of its identified real estate holdings no longer needed for operation. Regulatory Matters and Rate Trends To mitigate the volatility of electric fuel generation and purchased power costs in 2008 and beyond, WPSC is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its PSCW approved Risk Plan and Policy, including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options. In WPSCs retail electric rate case proceeding for 2006, the PSCW applied a "financial harm" test when considering the rate recovery of certain costs previously authorized for deferred accounting treatment. The PSCW has not applied a financial harm test previously when considering the rate recovery of costs that were previously authorized for deferral. In WPSCs rate case proceeding for 2006, after applying the financial harm test, the PSCW disallowed rate recovery of the 2004 extended outage at Kewaunee. The PSCW also disallowed recovery of 50% of the pre tax loss realized on the sale of Kewaunee. None of these disallowed costs were found to be imprudent by the PSCW. Notwithstanding the PSCWs decision on these Kewaunee related deferred costs, WPSC still believes it is probable that all regulatory assets recorded at December 31, 2007, will be collected from ratepayers. 64 Forecasting and monitoring of fuel costs have become extremely difficult for both the PSCW and WPSC. These challenges can be attributed to the implementation of the MISO Day 2 market and volatility in natural gas prices. In 2005, the PSCW received several applications from various Wisconsin electric utilities under the PSCW Chapter 116 fuel rules for large rate increases due to increased natural gas prices. In response, on February 7, 2006, the PSCW opened Docket 01 AC 224 to review the fuel rules. On February 1, 2007, the five utilities subject to the current fuel rules filed proposed changes to the fuel rules with the PSCW. The primary proposed change was to replace the trigger mechanism with a true "dead band" of 1%, which would limit a utilitys annual exposure or opportunity to a maximum of 1% of fuel costs. On May 3, 2007, the PSCW directed staff to prepare a draft rule revision to PSCW Chapter 116 fuel rules incorporating many of the components of the utilities proposal, with a 2% bandwidth as opposed to the 1% bandwidth recommended by the utilities. The PSCW staff circulated a draft rule to that effect and the parties have commented on the draft rule. The draft rule is currently awaiting PSCW action. For a discussion of regulatory filings and decisions, see Note 23, "Regulatory Environment." See Note 9, "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities," for a list of regulatory assets and liabilities recorded at December 31, 2007. Natural Gas Charge Reconciliation Proceedings and Related Matters For the Integrys Energy Group regulated retail gas operations, the ICC, PSCW, MPUC, and MPSC conduct annual proceedings regarding the reconciliation of revenues from the Gas Charge and related gas costs. In these proceedings, the accuracy of the reconciliation of revenues and costs is reviewed and the prudence of gas costs recovered through the Gas Charge is examined by interested parties. For additional information on the Gas Charge Reconciliation Proceedings and Related Matters, see Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies." Industry Restructuring Illinois The Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint at FERC on March 15, 2007, against 15 power generators and suppliers that won contracts in the auction to supply Commonwealth Edison and the three Ameren utilities. Integrys Energy Services was named in the complaint because it won three tranches of approximately 50 megawatts each in the auction. On August 29, 2007, the Attorney General filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the pending action at the FERC with prejudice. The FERC ruled on that motion and issued an order dismissing the peoples claims based on the Illinois 2006 power auction "with prejudice, and terminating the proceeding." On the heels of the Illinois Attorney Generals complaint filed at FERC, two class action lawsuits were filed by various ratepayers in Cook County. Those complaints, which essentially mirrored the Attorney Generals complaint, were removed to federal court. Motions to dismiss these cases filed by the defendants were granted on December 21, 2007, and the cases were dismissed without prejudice. Maine Integrys Energy Services continues to serve retail customers in both northern and southern Maine by way of direct customer contracts and Standard Offer Service for a number of utilities. Northern Maine customers experienced a significant increase in their energy supply rates starting January 1, 2007. This increase was a result of the competitive bid process conducted in late 2006 whereby Integrys Energy Services was the successful bidder. Integrys Energy Services is currently petitioning the Maine Public Utilities Commission for rate relief as a result of market rule changes in the northern Maine market. 65 These changes are a part of bidder conditions for the utility Standard Offer Service (default service) that was included in Integrys Energy Services bid in late 2006. The legislature is back in session and there are a few bills that will be of interest to Integrys Energy Services, ranging from the creation of a Northern Maine Power Authority, changes/enhancements to transmission investment, encouragement of wind development, and different levels of re regulation. New Renewable Portfolio Standard requirements are in effect for the state of Maine. The new standard will cause Competitive Electric Providers to acquire 10% of new renewable generation by 2017. As part of its obligations as an active Competitive Electricity Provider in Maine, Integrys Energy Services is working to meet this obligation with qualified generators. Seams Elimination Charge Adjustment For a discussion of SECA, see Note 23, "Regulatory Environment." Income Taxes Michigan Taxes On July 12, 2007, the Michigan Governor signed legislation that replaced the Single Business Tax with an effective date of January 1, 2008. On September 30, 2007, the Michigan legislature passed, and the governor signed into law, a "SFAS No. 109" amendment to the new Michigan Business Tax (MBT), providing a future tax deduction for existing book tax differences. This legislation allows companies to record a state deferred tax asset for this future tax deduction, which offsets the state deferred tax liability recorded in the third quarter of 2007 for this new MBT. On September 30, 2007, the Michigan legislature passed a bill that will expand the states 6% sales tax to additional services. The Governor signed the legislation on September 30, 2007. On December 1, 2007, the Governor signed legislation that would repeal the previous expansion of the states sales tax. The same legislation added an annual surcharge to taxpayers MBT liability. These new provisions discussed above are effective as of January 1, 2008, at which time we began recording the effects on current earnings. Environmental See Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies," for a detailed discussion of environmental considerations. Wisconsin Energy Efficiency and Renewables Act In March 2006, Wisconsins Governor signed 2005 Wisconsin Act 141 (2005 Senate Bill 459), the Energy Efficiency and Renewables Act, which requires Wisconsin electric providers to increase the amount of renewable electricity they sell by 2% above their current level before 2010 and 6% above their current level by 2015. The goal is to have 10% of the states electricity generated from renewable sources by 2015, which is intended to increase the use of renewable energy in Wisconsin, promote the development of renewable energy technologies, and strengthen the states energy efficiency programs. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 4% of Integrys Energy Groups generation in Wisconsin is from renewable sources. Integrys Energy Group continuously evaluates alternatives for cost effective renewable energy sources and will secure reliable and efficient renewable energy sources to meet both requirements by their respective dates. Currently, WPSC is negotiating a transaction to purchase a 99 megawatt wind generation project, to be constructed in Howard County, Iowa. An agreement with the counterparty is anticipated to be reached in the first quarter of 2008. 66 Michigan 21st Century Energy Plan On January 31, 2007, the MPSC Chairman presented the "21st Century Energy Plan" to Michigans Governor. The plan recognizes the increased need for energy in the next 20 years. The plan proposes an alternative method of receiving pre construction approval for significant generating plant additions versus the alternative of building a generation plant and then seeking approval for recovery of costs. The plan calls for legislation to implement a 10% renewable energy portfolio standard by 2015 as well as a statewide energy efficiency program. Discussions have moved to the legislature and several bills have been introduced, though none have been enacted at this time. Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator WPSC, UPPCO, and Integrys Energy Services are members of the MISO, which operates a financial and physical electric wholesale market in the Midwest. The market pricing is based on a locational marginal pricing system. MISO participants offer their generation and bid their customer load into the market on an hourly basis and on a day ahead basis. This results in net receipts from, or net obligations to, MISO for each hour of each day. MISO aggregates these hourly transactions and provides bi weekly settlement statements. These disputable settlements have an adjustment period based on the subsequent data which may require billing adjustments resulting in increases or decreases to the net MISO receipt or obligation. For WPSC and UPPCO, it is anticipated that the billing adjustments will be recovered through the state rate recovery process. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1(v), "New Accounting Pronouncements," for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements. GUARANTEES AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS See Note 18, "Guarantees," for information regarding guarantees. MARKET PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of Integrys Energy Services, along with oil options used to mitigate the risk of an increase in oil prices. Integrys Energy Services marketing and trading operations manage electricity and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments. Derivative instruments are utilized in these operations. Integrys Energy Services measures the fair value of derivative instruments on a mark to market basis. The fair value is included in assets or liabilities from risk management activities on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheet, with an offsetting entry to other comprehensive income (for the effective portion of cash flow hedges) or to earnings. The following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of Integrys Energy Services assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the year ended December 31, 2007. 67 Integrys Energy Services Mark to Market Roll Forward (Millions) Oil Options Natural Gas Electric Total Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2006(1) $ (4.7 ) $ 105.2 $ 7.1 $ 107.6 Plus: Contracts assumed in the merger with PEC 6.9 0.5 7.4 Less: Contracts realized or settled during period(2) (4.7 ) 120.6 (38.8 ) 77.1 Plus: Changes in fair value of contracts in existence at December 31, 2007(3) (0.2 ) 98.0 1.9 99.7 Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2007(1) $ (0.2 ) $ 89.5 $ 48.3 $ 137.6 (1) Reflects the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates. (2) Includes the value of contracts in existence at December 31, 2006, that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of December 31, 2007, along with the amortization of contracts originally accounted for as derivatives and later designated as normal purchases and sales under SFAS No. 133. (3) Includes unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at December 31, 2006, and contracts that were entered into subsequent to December 31, 2006, which are included in Integrys Energy Services portfolio at December 31, 2007, as well as gains and losses at the inception of contracts when a liquid market exists. There were, in many cases, offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period. The realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above. Market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts (generally for contracts with a duration of less than five years). The table below shows the sources of fair value and maturities of Integrys Energy Services risk management instruments. Integrys Energy Services Risk Management Contract Aging at Fair Value As of December 31, 2007 (Millions) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity In Excess of 5 years Total Fair Value Prices actively quoted(1) $ 37.2 $ 30.8 $ 10.8 $ $ 78.8 Prices provided by external sources(2) 7.5 36.9 3.0 47.4 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 11.4 11.4 Total fair value $ 44.7 $ 67.7 $ 13.8 $ 11.4 $ 137.6 (1) Includes exchange traded contracts such as NYMEX and ICE contracts and basis swaps. (2) Includes electric and natural gas contract positions for which pricing information, used by Integrys Energy Services to calculate fair value, is obtained primarily through broker quotes and other publicly available sources. 68 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Integrys Energy Group has identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. Integrys Energy Groups management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Risk Management Activities Integrys Energy Group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. At December 31, 2007, those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities. The utilities defer the effects of mark to market accounting for most energy related derivatives as regulatory assets or liabilities, pursuant to SFAS No. 71. In addition, Integrys Energy Group may apply the normal purchases and sales exception, provided by SFAS No. 133, as amended, to certain derivative contracts. The normal purchases and sales exception provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts. Cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when Integrys Energy Group enters contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases. Fair value hedge accounting may be used when Integrys Energy Group holds assets or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity may change between the contracts inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity. To the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged, there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge. Derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of SFAS No. 133, as amended, are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Integrys Energy Group. Changes in fair value, except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral, are generally included in the determination of income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled. When available, quoted market prices are used to determine a contracts fair value. If no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contracts duration, fair value is estimated through the use of internally developed valuation techniques or models using external information wherever possible. Such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by Integrys Energy Groups management. Like most commodity markets, after some length of time, markets for natural gas and power become relatively illiquid, making it difficult to obtain reliable price information. As a component of the fair value determination, Integrys Energy Group considers the requirements to service certain of its contracts as well as counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk. This component of the fair value determination is especially subjective because limited liquid market information is available. Under SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," beginning January 1, 2008, Integrys Energy Services will no longer include transaction costs in these fair value determinations. See Note 1(v), "New Accounting Pronouncements," for more information on this topic. The effect of changing the underlying assumptions for this component of fair value at December 31, 2007, is as follows: Change in Component Effect on Fair Value of Net Risk Management Assets at December 31, 2007 (Millions) 100% increase $27.1 decrease 50% decrease $13.5 increase 69 These potential changes in fair value would be included in current and long term liabilities from risk management activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as part of nonregulated revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income, unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, in which case potential changes would be included in Other Comprehensive Income Cash Flow Hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholders Equity. Purchase Accounting The merger with PEC in 2007, as well as the acquisitions of natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota in 2006, were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations". Under this statement, the purchase price paid by the acquirer, including transaction costs, is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date based on their fair values. The per share fair value of the common stock issued by Integrys Energy Group for the acquisition of PEC was determined by using the average market value of Integrys Energy Groups common stock over a five day period, beginning two days before the announcement date of the merger. As Integrys Energy Group announced its intent to sell PEP at the time of the closing of the merger, the PEP assets and liabilities were reported at estimated fair value less costs to sell. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results. As discussed below within "Asset Impairment," a significant amount of goodwill resulted from these acquisitions, which requires impairment testing on at least an annual basis. In conjunction with the PEC merger, the most significant fair value adjustments related to nonderivative commodity contracts and customer relationships, which were recorded as intangible assets at Integrys Energy Services. The intangible asset related to the contracts is being amortized into earnings as the contracts settle, and the intangible asset related to customer relationships is being amortized over the estimated lives of those relationships. The amortization of these items had a negative impact on earnings in 2008. PGL, NSG, MGUC, and MERC are predominantly regulated utilities; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," the fair value of the majority of their assets and liabilities did not change significantly as a result of applying purchase accounting. Environmental Activities Relating to Former Manufactured Gas Operations Integrys Energy Groups utility subsidiaries, their predecessors, and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose of manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas (manufactured gas sites). The utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs they incur in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities. The amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and managements best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites. Managements estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs. Integrys Energy Group considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs, and the extent of recovery from other potential responsible parties. (See Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion of environmental matters). 70 Asset Impairment Integrys Energy Group annually reviews its assets for impairment. SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," form the basis for these analyses. WPSC recorded goodwill of $36.4 million in its natural gas utility segment resulting from the Wisconsin Fuel and Light acquisition in 2001. In 2006, Integrys Energy Group recorded $267.0 million of goodwill in conjunction with the acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota. In 2007, $644.9 million of goodwill attributable to the PEC merger was recorded. The goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances warrant based on the guidance of SFAS No. 142. The test for impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each reporting unit using assumptions about future profitability of the reporting units. A significant decrease in market values and or projected future cash flows could result in an impairment loss. The review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to Integrys Energy Services than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property, plant, and equipment and lack of access to rate setting based on cost of service that is available to our regulated segments. At December 31, 2007, the carrying value of Integrys Energy Services property, plant, and equipment totaled $140.1 million. Integrys Energy Group believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing, production costs, capital expenditures, and generation volumes and (2) the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position or results of operations. Managements assumptions about future electricity and capacity prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs, environmental changes, and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The primary estimates used at Integrys Energy Services in the impairment analyses are future revenue streams and operating costs. A combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams. Integrys Energy Services forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices. These estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in SFAS No. 144. Integrys Energy Services evaluates property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. These indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets, and significant negative industry or economic trends. SFAS No. 144 requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a companys asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. For assets held for sale, impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value (or fair value less costs to sell if held for sale). Throughout 2007, Integrys Energy Services tested various power plants for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. No impairment charges were recorded in 2007 as a result of the recoverability tests. Results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future results given the nature of the accounting estimates involved, as discussed more fully above. Changes in actual results or assumptions could result in an impairment. Receivables and Reserves Our regulated natural gas and electric utilities and Integrys Energy Services accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed. Estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, and weather factors. The estimated unbilled sales 71 are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Integrys Energy Groups unbilled revenues were $464.7 million and $184.8 million, respectively. Any difference between actual sales and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period. Differences historically have not been significant. Integrys Energy Services, UPPCO, MERC, MGUC, PGL, and NSG record reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet. WPSC, however, records a regulatory asset to offset its uncollectible reserve. The reserve is most critical to PGL because their accounts receivables have higher credit risk and are sensitive to the price of natural gas, and to Integrys Energy Services because their receivables comprise the majority of the total. PGLs reserve for uncollectible accounts reflects its best estimates of probable losses on the accounts receivable balances. The reserve is based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors, including the impacts of natural gas prices and weather. Each quarter, PGL evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible accounts based on the most current available information and adjusts the reserve for changes in estimated probable accounts receivable losses. Integrys Energy Services calculates the reserve for potential uncollectible customer receivable balances by applying an estimated bad debt experience rate to each past due aging category and reserving for 100% of specific customer receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible. The basis for calculating the reserve for receivables from wholesale counterparties considers netting agreements, collateral, and guarantees. If the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect, or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults, there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance. Pension and Postretirement Benefits The costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, described in Note 19, "Employee Benefit Plans," are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, discount rates used in determining the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Integrys Energy Groups pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. Management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process. The following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported annual pension cost on the income statement. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. 72 Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percent Change in Assumption Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation Impact on Pension Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 66.3 $ 2.4 Discount rate 0.5 (61.8 ) (3.6 ) Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 5.2 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (5.2 ) The following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and the reported annual other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percent Change in Assumption Impact on Postretirement Benefit Obligation Impact on Postretirement Benefit Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 24.8 $ 2.3 Discount rate 0.5 (22.8 ) (1.9 ) Health care cost trend rate (1.0 ) (41.1 ) (6.9 ) Health care cost trend rate 1.0 49.7 7.7 Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 1.1 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (1.1 ) Integrys Energy Group utilizes the assistance of its plan actuaries in determining the expected timing of cash outflows from plan payments. Integrys Energy Group considers bonds, rated by Moodys as "Aa" or better, when determining the discount rate at the measurement date. Regression analysis is applied to construct a best fit curve that makes coupon yields to maturity a function of time to maturity. The pension or retiree medical cash flows are then matched to the appropriate spot rates and discounted back to the measurement date. To select an assumed long term rate of return on qualified plan assets, the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class are considered, as well as the target allocation of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long term rate of return was 8.5% in 2007, 2006, and 2005. For 2007, 2006, and 2005, the actual rates of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, were 6.2%, 11.3%, and 6.9%, respectively. The determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. Cumulative gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets are recognized for purposes of calculating benefit cost over a five year period. Because of this method, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. More information on health care cost trend rates can be found in Note 19, "Employee Benefit Plans." For a table showing future payments that Integrys Energy Group expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 19, "Employee Benefit Plans." Regulatory Accounting The electric and natural gas utility segments of Integrys Energy Group follow SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and our financial statements reflect the effects of the 73 different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments. We defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral of these items as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings at the utility segments, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Once approved, we amortize the regulatory assets and liabilities into income over the rate recovery period. If recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income. If our regulated electric and natural gas utility segments would no longer meet the criteria for application of SFAS No. 71, we would discontinue its application as defined under SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of SFAS No. 71." Assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write off of all of Integrys Energy Groups regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2007, would result in a 11.1% decrease in total assets and a 4.7% decrease in total liabilities. Tax Provision As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in the income statement. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret them differently. As of January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FAS 109." As allowed under Interpretation No. 48, Integrys Energy Group elected to change its method of accounting to record interest and penalties paid on income tax obligations as a component of income tax expense. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and technical interpretations of applicable tax law and regulation across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on Integrys Energy Groups financial condition and results of operations. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and report operating results in terms of historic cost. The statements provide a reasonable, objective, and quantifiable statement of financial results, but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation. For our regulated operations, to the extent we are not recovering the effects of inflation, we will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions. Our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs. However, any increase from inflation is offset with projected business growth. Therefore, the estimated effect of inflation on our nonregulated businesses is minor. 74 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks and Other Significant Risks Integrys Energy Group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk (including regulatory recovery risk), interest rate risk, equity return risk, and principal preservation risk. Integrys Energy Group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries business and the environment in which we operate. Integrys Energy Group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures, as further described below. Commodity Price Risk and Regulatory Recovery Risk Utilities The electric utilities of Integrys Energy Group purchase natural gas and coal for use in power generation. They also purchase power on the MISO market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation. As a result, the electric utilities are subject to commodity price risk, which they manage in a number of ways, the primary method being fuel recovery mechanisms reflected in the rates charged to customers. Prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by UPPCO and by the Michigan retail electric operations and wholesale electric operations of WPSC. The costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utility subsidiaries are generally also recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms. These recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities. WPSCs Wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations, but annual rate cases have mitigated the year to year price risk. For intra year price risk, a "fuel window" mechanism is used to recover costs resulting from significant price volatility. Under the fuel window, if actual fuel and purchased power costs deviate by more than 2% (the range for 2007 and 2008), a rate review can be triggered. Once a rate review is triggered, rates may be reset (subject to PSCW approval) for the remainder of the year to recover, on an annualized basis, the projected increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power. For 2008, under the order approving the PEC merger, WPSC was allowed to adjust Wisconsin retail electric rates effective January 1, 2008, subject to the fuel window, to take into account the impact of natural gas prices on purchased power costs, as well as changes in the price of coal, rail costs to ship the coal, and natural gas used for fuel. However, for 2008, WPSC was not allowed to adjust retail electric rates for other changes. To manage commodity price risk, our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and electricity. In addition, the electric operation of WPSC and the natural gas operations of WPSC, PGL, NSG, and MERC are employing risk management techniques pursuant to the risk policies approved by their respective regulators, which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps, futures and options. Nonregulated Subsidiary As part of its trading activities, Integrys Energy Services seeks to generate profits from the volatility of the price of electricity by purchasing or selling various financial and physical instruments (such as forward contracts, options, financial transmission rights, and capacity contracts) in established wholesale markets where Integrys Energy Services has market expertise, under risk management policies set by management and approved by Integrys Energy Groups Board of Directors. Integrys Energy Services also seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and customer contract portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments (such as forward contracts, options, financial transmission rights, and capacity contracts). 75 To measure commodity price risk exposure, Integrys Energy Group employs a number of controls and processes, including a value at risk (VaR) analysis of its exposures. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio (primarily natural gas and power positions), which includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet, but excludes the long dated positions created by the merchant generating fleet and associated coal, sulfur dioxide emission allowances, and other ancillary fuels. VaR is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors, within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period. VaR models are relatively sophisticated. However, the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model. The instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used. VaR is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. In addition to VaR, Integrys Energy Services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations and stress testing. In conjunction with the VaR analysis, these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for Integrys Energy Services risk exposure. Integrys Energy Services VaR is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a 95% confidence level. The delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods, such as one day, are normally distributed. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options, as well as commodities held in inventory, such as natural gas held in storage, to the extent such positions are significant. The VaR for Integrys Energy Services trading portfolio is presented in the following table: (Millions) 2007 2006 95% confidence level, one day holding period, one tailed December 31 $ 0.9 $ 0.9 Average for twelve months ended December 31 1.1 1.1 High for 12 months ended December 31 1.3 1.5 Low for 12 months ended December 31 0.9 0.9 The average, high, and low amounts were computed using the VaR amounts at each of the four quarter ends. Interest Rate Risk Integrys Energy Group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Integrys Energy Group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so. Integrys Energy Group may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. 76 Due to decreases in short term commercial paper borrowings in the last year, Integrys Energy Group has decreased its exposure to variable interest rates. Based on the variable rate debt of Integrys Energy Group outstanding at December 31, 2007, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points in 2007 would have increased annual interest expense by $6.5 million. Comparatively, based on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased interest expense by approximately $7.5 million. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would take action to mitigate Integrys Energy Groups exposure to the change. Equity Return and Principal Preservation Risk Integrys Energy Group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds. The trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. Integrys Energy Group maintains qualified pension plans for employees retirement. Declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs for the plan and possible future required contributions. Changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits could also impact future contributions. Integrys Energy Group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices. Most of the employee benefit costs relate to Integrys Energy Groups regulated utilities. As such, the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates, mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures. 77
