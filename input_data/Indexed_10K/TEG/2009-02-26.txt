ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Integrys Energy Group is a diversified energy holding company with regulated electric and natural gas utility operations (serving approximately 2.2 million customers in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), nonregulated energy operations, and an equity ownership interest in ATC (a federally regulated electric transmission company operating in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois) of approximately 34%. Strategic Overview Integrys Energy Groups goal is to create long term value for shareholders and customers primarily through growth in its core regulated businesses. The company has made a decision to either fully or partially divest of its nonregulated energy services business segment, Integrys Energy Services, or reduce its size, risk, and financial requirements in response to increased collateral requirements at a time when global credit and financial markets are constraining the availability and increasing the cost of capital. In order to create value, Integrys Energy Group focuses on: Maintaining and Growing a Strong Regulated Utility Base A strong regulated utility base is necessary to maintain a strong balance sheet, predictable cash flows, a desired risk profile, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings, which are critical to our success. Integrys Energy Group believes the following investments have helped, or will help, maintain and grow its regulated utility base: The February 2007 merger with PEC, which added the natural gas distribution operations of PGL and NSG to the regulated utility base of Integrys Energy Group. Our ownership interest in ATC, which owned over $2.5 billion of assets at December 31, 2008. Integrys Energy Group will continue to fund its share of the equity portion of future ATC growth. ATC plans to invest $2.7 billion in the next ten years to ensure that the power grid will continue to meet the needs of its customers. Weston 4, a 537 megawatt coal fired base load power plant located near Wausau, Wisconsin, was completed and became operational June 30, 2008. WPS holds a 70% ownership interest in the Weston 4 power plant. A proposed accelerated annual investment in natural gas distribution facilities (replacement of cast iron mains) at PGL. The investment of approximately $79 million to connect WPSs natural gas distribution system to the Guardian II natural gas pipeline to be completed in 2009. WPSs purchase of a 99 megawatt wind generation project to be constructed in 2009 in Howard County, Iowa. WPSs continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators. Capital projects to construct and upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year. For more detailed information on Integrys Energy Groups capital expenditure program, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources, Capital Requirements." Systematically Reduce the Size and the Capital and Liquidity Commitments of the Nonregulated Energy Services Business Segment Unprecedented energy price volatility, combined with significant 35 growth in the forward customer business, has increased the collateral requirements of Integrys Energy Services at a time when global credit and financial market conditions are both constraining the availability and increasing the cost of capital. As a result, Integrys Energy Group has decided to take steps to protect its financial position and liquidity by either fully or partially divesting of its nonregulated energy services business segment or significantly scaling it back. On an operational level, Integrys Energy Groups short term strategy will be to reduce and refocus its financial, credit, and risk capital on those aspects of Integrys Energy Services business that yield the highest return, with consideration given toward lower risk. Integrys Energy Services has recently, and as necessary in the future, expects it will continue to adjust pricing strategies to capture margins that are commensurate with its increasing capital costs and collateral requirements. Longer term, in the event that a full divestiture of Integrys Energy Services does not occur and a portion of the nonregulated energy services business segment remains, it will be a smaller segment that requires significantly less capital, parental guarantees, and overall financial liquidity from Integrys Energy Group. Integrys Energy Group is seeking to deploy its capital to areas with more desirable risk adjusted rates of return. Although Integrys Energy Group anticipates a reduction in future earnings capacity from this business segment going forward, an improvement in the liquidity position and reduced business risk profile of Integrys Energy Group is expected. Integrating Resources to Provide Operational Excellence Integrys Energy Group is committed to integrating resources of all its regulated and nonregulated businesses, while meeting all applicable regulatory and legal requirements. This will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and lowering costs. Integrys Energy Group believes the following recent developments have helped, or will help, integrate resources and provide operational excellence: The PEC merger provides the opportunity to align the best practices and expertise of both companies, which will continue to result in efficiencies by eliminating redundant and overlapping functions and systems. IBS, a wholly owned service company of Integrys Energy Group, became operational on January 1, 2008. IBS was formed to achieve a significant portion of the cost synergies anticipated from the PEC merger through the consolidation and efficient delivery of various support services and to provide more consistent and transparent allocation of costs throughout Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. "Operational Excellence" initiatives were implemented to provide top performance in the areas of project management, process improvement, and contract administration and compliance in order to reduce costs and manage projects and activities within appropriate budgets, schedules, and regulations. Placing Strong Emphasis on Asset and Risk Management Our asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of our existing assets, the acquisition of assets, and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement our existing business and strategy. The goal is to provide the most efficient use of our resources while maximizing return and maintaining an acceptable risk profile. This strategy focuses on the disposition of assets, including plants and entire business units, which are no longer strategic to ongoing operations, are not performing as needed, or have an unacceptable risk profile. We maintain a portfolio approach to risk and earnings. Our decision regarding the future of Integrys Energy Services noted above illustrates our asset management strategy. Our risk management strategy includes the management of market, credit, and operational risk through the course of business. Forward purchases and sales of electric capacity, energy, natural gas, and other commodities allow opportunities to secure prices in a volatile energy market. Each business unit monitors daily oversight of the risk profile related to these instruments consistent with the companys risk management policy. The Corporate Risk Management Group, which reports through the Chief Financial Officer, provides corporate oversight. 36 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, (Millions except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 Change in 2008 Over 2007 Change in 2007 Over 2006 Natural gas utility operations $ 84.5 $ 28.7 $ (2.3 ) 194.4 % N/A Electric utility operations 92.6 87.4 85.5 5.9 % 2.2 % Nonregulated energy operations (61.5 ) 98.0 72.3 N/A 35.5 % Holding company and other operations 10.8 (18.8 ) 0.3 N/A N/A Oil and natural gas operations 56.0 (100.0 )% N/A Income available for common shareholders $ 126.4 $ 251.3 $ 155.8 (49.7 )% 61.3 % Average basic shares of common stock 76.7 71.6 42.3 7.1 % 69.3 % Average diluted shares of common stock 77.0 71.8 42.4 7.2 % 69.3 % Basic earnings per share $ 1.65 $ 3.51 $ 3.68 (53.0 )% (4.6 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 1.64 $ 3.50 $ 3.67 (53.1 )% (4.6 )% Earnings Summary From 2007 to 2008, income available for common shareholders decreased $124.9 million and diluted earnings per share decreased $1.86. From 2006 to 2007, income available for common shareholders increased $95.5 million and diluted earnings per share decreased $0.17. Significant factors impacting the change in earnings and diluted earnings per share were as follows (and are discussed in more detail thereafter). Natural Gas Utility Operations: Earnings improved $55.8 million in 2008, compared with 2007, primarily due to the following: The inclusion of PGL and NSG for all of 2008 compared with only a partial year of operations in 2007 since they were acquired on February 21, 2007. A rate increase for PGL in February 2008 also contributed to the increase in earnings in 2008. From 2007 to 2008, after tax earnings related to PGL and NSG operations increased $43.3 million, after including a $6.5 million after tax goodwill impairment loss related to NSG in 2008. An increase in natural gas sales volumes, which drove an approximate $11 million ($6.6 million after tax) increase in margin for WPS, MERC, and MGU. An interim rate increase for MERC, effective October 1, 2008, which had a positive impact on margin. Financial results improved $31.0 million in 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to the following: Financial results for MGU and MERC increased $18.1 million, from a combined net loss of $11.3 million in 2006, to earnings of $6.8 million in 2007. The positive change in earnings at MGU and MERC was driven by the fact that these natural gas utilities operated during the first quarter heating season in 2007, but were not acquired by Integrys Energy Group until after the first quarter 2006 heating season. In addition, MGU and MERC incurred a combined $11.8 million ($7.1 million after tax) of transition costs in 2006 for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees. In 2007, MGU and MERC were allocated $1.7 million ($1.0 million after tax) of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the PEC merger. 37 Regulated natural gas utility earnings at WPS increased $13.5 million, from earnings of $9.6 million in 2006, to earnings of $23.1 million in 2007. Higher earnings were driven by increased volumes due to colder weather during the heating season. The full year impact of the natural gas rate increase that was effective January 12, 2007, also contributed to the increase. PGL and NSG, which were acquired effective February 21, 2007, recognized a combined net loss of approximately $1 million in 2007, primarily related to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities, which derive earnings during the heating season (first and fourth quarters). Because of the late February acquisition date, results for the majority of the two coldest months of the year were not included in natural gas utility earnings in 2007. The 2007 net income for PGL was less than the level we would normally expect, primarily due to increased costs of providing service. Electric Utility Operations: Earnings increased $5.2 million in 2008 compared with 2007, resulting primarily from: A combined $17.7 million ($10.6 million after tax) decrease in electric maintenance expense and costs to achieve merger synergies related to the PEC merger. An approximate $10 million ($6 million after tax) increase in margin from WPSs 2008 retail electric rate increase effective January 16, 2008, and the full benefit of WPSs 2007 retail electric rate increase effective January 12, 2007. An approximate $10 million ($6 million after tax) increase in margin driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year. An approximate $5 million ($3 million after tax) increase in regulated electric utility margin year over year, driven by fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $1 million lower than what was recovered in rates during 2008, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $4 million higher than what was recovered in rates during 2007. The above increases were partially offset by: A $13.8 million ($8.3 million after tax) increase in electric transmission expenses primarily related to higher rates charged by MISO and ATC due to additional transmission costs. An increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $4.2 million ($2.5 million after tax) driven by depreciation related to Weston 4, which was placed in service for accounting purposes in April 2008. An approximate $11 million ($6.6 million after tax) decrease in margin due to a decline in residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes at WPS as a result of cooler weather during the cooling season and customer conservation efforts. A $4.3 million ($2.6 million after tax) increase in interest expense. Earnings increased $1.9 million in 2007 over 2006, resulting primarily from the following: Retail electric rate increases at both WPS and UPPCO had a positive year over year impact on operating income. Favorable weather at WPS contributed an approximate $6 million ($3.6 million after tax) year over year increase in operating income; however, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage. 38 Fuel and purchased power costs were higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in 2006, driving a $14.4 million ($8.6 million after tax) negative variance in operating income. Maintenance expense related to WPSs power plants was higher in 2007 compared with 2006, driven by an increase in unplanned outages in 2007 as well as longer than anticipated 2007 planned outages. Nonregulated Energy/Integrys Energy Services Operations: Financial results decreased $159.5 million in 2008, compared with 2007, primarily due to the following: A $133.6 million after tax decrease in Integrys Energy Services GAAP margin year over year related to non cash activity, of which $106.1 million was related to non cash activity associated with electric operations, with the remaining $27.5 million related to non cash activity associated with natural gas operations. An overview of this non cash activity has been provided below. Non cash electric operations: A decline in energy prices during 2008 drove an $82.4 million net after tax non cash loss, compared with a $23.7 million net after tax non cash gain recognized in 2007, related to an increase in energy prices during 2007. The non cash unrealized gains and losses recognized resulted from the application of derivative accounting rules to Integrys Energy Services portfolio of derivative electric customer supply contracts, requiring that these derivative instruments be adjusted to fair market value. The derivative instruments are utilized to economically hedge the price, volume, and ancillary risks associated with related electric customer sales contracts. The associated electric customer sales contracts are not adjusted to fair value, as they do not meet the definition of derivative instruments under GAAP, creating an accounting mismatch. As such, the non cash unrealized gains and losses related to the electric customer supply contracts will vary each period, with noncash unrealized gains being recognized in periods of increasing energy prices and non cash unrealized losses being recognized in periods of declining energy prices, and will ultimately reverse when the related customer sales contracts settle. Non cash natural gas operations: The spot price of natural gas decreased significantly during the second half of 2008 (below the average cost of natural gas in inventory which Integrys Energy Services had injected into storage earlier in 2008), which resulted in a lower of cost or market adjustment, as required by GAAP. This adjustment contributed a $96.2 million year over year decrease in the non cash natural gas margin, driven by non cash inventory write downs in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The negative impact on realized margin related to these inventory adjustments was substantially offset by $91.9 million of net after tax non cash unrealized gains recognized in 2008, primarily related to derivative instruments utilized to mitigate the price risk on natural gas inventory underlying natural gas storage transactions. In 2007, natural gas derivative instruments resulted in the recognition of $23.2 million of net after tax non cash unrealized gains. Similar to the electric operations discussed above, non cash gains and losses related to derivative natural gas sales and customer supply contracts will vary each period, and will ultimately reverse when the physical contracts settle, or when natural gas is withdrawn from inventory. The recognition of $17.1 million of after tax earnings from Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel production facility during the year ended December 31, 2007. Production and sale of synthetic fuel by Integrys Energy Services ended when Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code, which provided for Section 29/45K federal tax credits from the production and sale of synthetic fuel, expired effective December 31, 2007. 39 After tax income from discontinued operations decreased $10.9 million as a result of the sale of Niagara Generation in 2007, which was partially offset by a contingent gain that was realized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the sale of the Stoneman generating facility in the third quarter of 2008. Operating and maintenance expenses at Integrys Energy Services increased $22.3 million ($13.4 million after tax) in 2008 compared with 2007, driven by an increase in bad debt expense, broker commissions, a full year of operations from businesses acquired in the PEC merger, and employee benefit costs. Partially offsetting the above decreases, the realized retail electric margin increased $28.1 million ($16.9 million after tax), driven primarily from operations in Illinois, due to the addition of new customers as a result of the PEC merger, and the reduced impact from purchase accounting in 2008. Earnings increased $25.7 million in 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to the following: Operating income at Integrys Energy Services increased $40.2 million ($24.1 million after tax). After tax income from discontinued operations at Integrys Energy Services increased $7.5 million, driven by the sale of Niagara Generation, LLC in the first quarter of 2007. Miscellaneous expense at Integrys Energy Services decreased $11.1 million ($6.7 million after tax), driven by a decrease in pre tax losses recognized for the period related to Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility. Minority interest income decreased $3.7 million ($2.2 million after tax) as Integrys Energy Services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and, therefore, did not share in losses from this facility in 2007. Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized from Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility decreased $15.9 million, from $29.5 million in 2006, to $13.6 million in 2007. The decrease in Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized was driven by the impact of high oil prices on our ability to realize the benefit of Section 29/45K federal tax credits. Holding Company and Other Operations: Financial results increased $29.6 million from 2007 to 2008, largely due to higher earnings from our investment in ATC, lower interest expense, and lower operating expenses at the holding company, partially offset by the negative year over year impact on operating income related to the reallocation of external costs to achieve merger synergies in 2007. In 2007, financial results decreased $19.1 million, from earnings of $0.3 million in 2006, to a net loss of $18.8 million. See "Overview of Holding Company and Other Segment Operations" for more information. Oil and Natural Gas Operations: In connection with the PEC merger, Integrys Energy Group announced its intent to divest of PECs oil and natural gas production operations, PEP. PEP was sold in the third quarter of 2007. In 2007, PEP recognized earnings of $56.0 million, including $58.5 million of earnings reported as discontinued operations. The sale of PEP resulted in a $7.6 million after tax gain in 2007. In 2008, tax adjustments of $0.8 million related to the 2007 PEP sale were recorded as discontinued operations. 40 Earnings per share: Diluted earnings per share was impacted by a 5.2 million share (7.2%) increase in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of Integrys Energy Group common stock from 2007 to 2008, as well as an increase of 29.4 million shares (69.3%) in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of Integrys Energy Groups common stock from 2006 to 2007. Integrys Energy Group issued 31.9 million shares of common stock on February 21, 2007, in conjunction with the merger with PEC, and issued an additional 2.7 million shares of common stock in May 2006 in order to settle its forward equity agreement with an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities. Additional shares were also issued under the Stock Investment Plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans in 2007 and 2006. The following discussion provides the analysis of Integrys Energy Groups four segments: regulated natural gas utility, regulated electric utility, Integrys Energy Services, and its holding company and other segment. Utility Operations In 2008, the utility operations included the regulated natural gas utility segment, consisting of the natural gas operations of PGL, WPS, MERC, MGU, and NSG. The regulated natural gas operations of WPS, MERC, and MGU, were included in results of operations for all of 2007, while the regulated natural gas operations of PGL and NSG were included in results of operations beginning February 22, 2007 through December 31, 2007. The natural gas operations of WPS were included for all of 2006, while the natural gas operations of MGU and MERC were included from April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and July 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, respectively. Utility operations also included the regulated electric segment, consisting of the regulated electric operations of WPS and UPPCO for all of 2008, 2007, and 2006. Regulated Natural Gas Utility Segment Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Change in 2008 Over 2007 Change in 2007 Over 2006 Revenues $ 3,025.9 $ 2,103.7 $ 676.9 43.8 % 210.8 % Purchased natural gas costs 2,147.7 1,453.5 493.8 47.8 % 194.4 % Margins 878.2 650.2 183.1 35.1 % 255.1 % Operating and maintenance expense 539.1 427.4 121.3 26.1 % 252.4 % Goodwill impairment loss * 6.5 N/A % Depreciation and amortization expense 108.3 97.7 32.7 10.8 % 198.8 % Taxes other than income taxes 32.1 33.1 11.8 (3.0 )% 180.5 % Operating income 192.2 92.0 17.3 108.9 % 431.8 % Miscellaneous income 7.0 5.5 1.0 27.3 % 450.0 % Interest expense (56.6 ) (53.4 ) (18.1 ) 6.0 % 195.0 % Other expense (49.6 ) (47.9 ) (17.1 ) 3.5 % 180.1 % Income before taxes $ 142.6 $ 44.1 $ 0.2 223.4 % 21,950.0 % Throughput in therms Residential 1,708.9 1,251.8 351.5 36.5 % 256.1 % Commercial and industrial 550.8 439.2 190.6 25.4 % 130.4 % Interruptible 60.1 59.4 40.1 1.2 % 48.1 % Interdepartmental 28.6 47.1 27.6 (39.3 )% 70.7 % Transport 1,834.0 1,505.6 657.5 21.8 % 129.0 % Total sales in therms 4,182.4 3,303.1 1,267.3 26.6 % 160.6 % * See Note 9, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for more information. 41 Revenue 2008 Compared with 2007: Regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased $922.2 million, driven by: A combined increase in PGL and NSG natural gas utility revenue of $780.5 million, from $1,118.5 million during 2007, to $1,899.0 million during 2008. The increase in revenue at both of these natural gas utilities was driven primarily by the fact that they were not included in regulated natural gas utility results until after the merger with PEC on February 21, 2007. Other factors that contributed to this combined increase include: PGLs annualized rate increase effective February 14, 2008, which increased revenue year over year by approximately $61 million. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on the PGL and NSG rate cases. Higher year over year natural gas prices. Increases in natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in rates. Colder weather during the 2008 heating season, partially offset by energy conservation efforts by natural gas utility customers and a larger number of customer disconnections, which we believe resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy. An increase in natural gas revenue of $141.7 million at the remaining natural gas utilities (WPS, MERC, and MGU) from $985.1 million during 2007, to $1,126.8 million during 2008, which resulted primarily from: A combined $112.2 million increase in revenue driven by the approximate 13% increase in the per unit cost of natural gas in 2008 compared with 2007. A $43.4 million increase in revenue from colder weather during the 2008 heating season compared with 2007, evidenced by an approximate 11% year over year increase in heating degree days across these three utilities. An increase in revenue from MERCs interim rate increase, effective October 1, 2008, for retail natural gas customers. This interim rate increase is subject to refund pending the final rate order, which is expected in the second quarter of 2009. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on MERCs interim rate increase. The combined increase in revenue at WPS, MGU, and MERC, was partially offset by a $17.9 million decrease in revenue driven by a decrease in year over year volumes normalized for the impact of weather, $15.6 million of which was driven by a 39.3% decrease in natural gas throughput volumes sold by WPS to its electric utility segment. The decrease in volumes sold to the electric utility segment was a result of a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units during the 2008 summer cooling season because of cooler year over year weather. In addition, additional electricity was available within the electric utility segment from Weston 4, a coal fired generating facility that became commercially operational in June 2008. The remaining decrease in weather normalized volumes was driven by energy conservation efforts of residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year, which we believe resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy. 42 2007 Compared with 2006: Regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased $1,426.8 million, driven by the following: PGL and NSG (acquired February 21, 2007) generated $1,118.5 million of natural gas utility revenue and contributed approximately 1.5 billion therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2007. MERC (which acquired natural gas distribution operations in Minnesota on July 1, 2006) generated $294.0 million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately 705 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2007, compared with $123.0 million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately 348 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2006. MGU (which acquired natural gas distribution operations in Michigan on April 1, 2006) generated $220.2 million of natural gas utility revenue and approximately 311 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes in 2007, compared with $110.1 million of natural gas revenue and approximately 193 million therms of natural gas throughput volumes during 2006. WPSs natural gas utility revenue increased $27.2 million, from $443.8 million in 2006, to $471.0 million in 2007, driven by the following: On January 11, 2007, the PSCW issued a final written order to WPS authorizing a retail natural gas distribution rate increase of $18.9 million (3.8%), effective January 12, 2007. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information related to the retail natural gas rate increase at WPS. An 8.6% increase in natural gas throughput volumes. The increase in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by a 10.3% increase in residential volumes and a 70.7% increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility. The increase in sales volumes to residential customers was driven in part by colder year over year weather during the 2007 heating season. The increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility was driven by an increase in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units. Natural gas prices were 10.1% lower on a per unit basis, compared with 2006, resulting in a decrease in natural gas utility revenue, which partially offset the overall increase in natural gas utility revenue at WPS. Margin 2008 Compared with 2007: The regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased $228.0 million, primarily due to: An increase in the combined margin at PGL and NSG of $208.6 million, from $387.2 million in 2007 to $595.8 million in 2008. The increase in combined margin was driven by: The acquisition of PGL and NSG on February 21, 2007. The combined operations for the entire heating season were included in the 2008 natural gas utility margin. However, only operations from the merger date through December 31, 2007, were included in the 2007 natural gas utility margin. Due to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities, higher margins are generally derived during the heating season (first and fourth quarters). The 2008 rate increase for PGL which resulted in an approximate $61 million increase in margin. Colder than normal weather experienced by both PGL and NSG resulted in an approximate $7 million increase in 2008 margin before the decoupling mechanism went into effect on March 1, 2008. 43 An increase in natural gas margin of $19.4 million at the remaining natural gas utilities (WPS, MERC, and MGU), primarily driven by: A combined 5.2% increase in natural gas throughput volumes at WPS, MERC, and MGU, which had an approximate $11 million positive impact on natural gas utility margins. Colder year over year weather had an approximate $14 million positive impact on margins. Partially offsetting the positive impact of colder weather, were energy conservation efforts by residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year, which had an approximate $3 million negative impact on margins. The interim rate increase for MERC, effective October 1, 2008, which had a positive impact on natural gas margin. An approximate $2 million year over year increase in margin at MGU related to an adjustment for recovery of prior natural gas costs in an MPSC proceeding. 2007 Compared with 2006: The regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased $467.1 million, driven by the following: The combined margin provided by PGL and NSG in 2007 of $387.2 million. The combined margin at MGU and MERC increased $55.1 million, from $59.1 million in 2006, to $114.2 million in 2007. The increase in natural gas margin at MGU and MERC was driven primarily by the fact that MGU and MERC operated during the first quarter heating season in 2007, but were not acquired by Integrys Energy Group until after the first quarter heating season in 2006. WPSs natural gas margin increased $24.8 million, from $124.0 million in 2006, to $148.8 million in 2007. The increase in WPSs margin was driven by the retail natural gas rate increase and an increase in throughput volumes to higher margin residential customers due in part to colder year over year weather during the heating season. The increase in throughput volumes sold to the electric utility did not have a significant impact on WPSs natural gas utility margin. Operating Income 2008 Compared with 2007: Operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased $100.2 million, driven by the $228.0 million increase in the natural gas utility margin, partially offset by a $127.8 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily related to an increase in combined operating expenses at PGL and NSG of $125.8 million, from $368.7 million for 2007 to $494.5 million for 2008. The increase in operating expenses related to PGL and NSG was primarily driven by: The acquisition of these natural gas utilities on February 21, 2007. As a result, operating expenses for the period January 1, 2007 to the acquisition date were not included in the 2007 operating results. A non cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.5 million recognized in the second quarter of 2008 related to NSG. A combined increase in bad debt expense, driven by the impact of high energy prices and worsening economic conditions on overall accounts receivable balances. 44 2007 Compared with 2006: Operating income increased $74.7 million, driven by the $467.1 million increase in the regulated natural gas utility margin, partially offset by a $306.1 million increase in operating and maintenance expense, a $65.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $21.3 million increase in taxes other than income taxes. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to the following: Combined operating and maintenance expenses of $292.9 million incurred by PGL and NSG in 2007. Combined operating and maintenance expense at MGU and MERC that increased approximately $9 million, primarily due to the fact that operating expenses at both of these utilities incurred prior to the acquisition were not included in earnings in 2006, compared to incurring a full year of operating and maintenance expenses in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, $11.8 million of combined operating and maintenance expense related to external transition costs, primarily for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees. For the year ended December 31, 2007, MGU and MERC were allocated $1.7 million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the PEC merger. Operating expenses related to WPSs natural gas operations increased $3.7 million year over year, due primarily to the allocation of $2.8 million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the PEC merger. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to the merger with PEC (a combined $59.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense was recognized at PGL and NSG from February 21, 2007 to December 31, 2007) and an increase in depreciation expense at MERC and MGU (these businesses were not included in results of operations for the full year in 2006). Depreciation and amortization expense at WPSs natural gas utility was relatively flat year over year. The increase in taxes other than income taxes from 2006 to 2007 was primarily related to the merger with PEC ($16.8 million of taxes other than income taxes were recognized at PGL and NSG in 2007), and the acquisition of the Michigan and Minnesota natural gas distribution operations, which were not included in results of operations for the full year in 2006. Taxes other than income taxes are primarily related to property taxes, gross receipts taxes, and payroll taxes paid by these companies. Other Expense 2008 Compared with 2007: Other expense at the regulated natural gas utilities increased $1.7 million, driven by a $3.2 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in miscellaneous income. The increase in other expense was a result of: A $6.1 million increase in combined interest expense at PGL and NSG, from $30.3 million in 2007 to $36.4 million in 2008. The increase in interest expense at PGL and NSG is primarily due to the fact that these utilities were first acquired on February 21, 2007, and, therefore, did not recognize a full year of interest expense in 2007. The increase in interest expense was also due to additional long term debt borrowings and higher interest rates on new and remarketed long term debt. 45 The increase in other expense was offset by: A $2.6 million increase in AFUDC at WPS related to the construction of natural gas laterals for connection to the Guardian II pipeline. A decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in short term borrowing levels and a decrease in interest rates for WPSs natural gas segment. 2007 Compared with 2006: Other expense at the regulated natural gas utilities increased $30.8 million, driven by a $35.3 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in miscellaneous income. The increase in other expense was a result of combined interest expense of $30.3 million, partially offset by $4.5 million of miscellaneous income, recorded both at PGL and NSG from February 22, 2007, through December 31, 2007.

There was an approximate $36 million increase in opportunity sales year over year as the electric utility had more low cost generation with Weston 4 becoming commercially operational in 2008, combined with available capacity from lower sales volumes to residential customers. In addition, WPS experienced an approximate $12 million increase in wholesale revenue, driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year. The increase in revenue related to wholesale volumes was partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in residential sales volumes and a 1.3% decrease in commercial and industrial sales volumes year over year, which drove an approximate $22 million decrease in revenue. Of this decrease in revenue, approximately $13 million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers, which we believe was the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown. Approximately $6 million related to decreased demand by our commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as the economy weakened. In addition, cooler weather during the 2008 cooling season compared to 2007 contributed approximately $3 million to the decrease in revenue. An interim fuel surcharge approved by the PSCW for WPSs retail electric customers effective March 22, 2008, related to higher fuel and purchased power costs. In addition, a surcharge increase was approved by the PSCW effective July 4, 2008. Both orders had an overall impact on revenue of approximately $25 million. Contributing factors in this rate change were increased purchased power costs due to lower than expected generation from the new Weston 4 power plant during the start up phases, increased coal and coal transportation costs, and increased natural gas costs. On September 30, 2008, the PSCW reopened the 2008 fuel surcharge to review forecasted fuel costs as WPSs current and anticipated annual fuel costs were below those projected in the fuel surcharge. As a result of these lower costs, WPS accrued at December 31, 2008 a refund payable in 2009 to its electric customers of approximately $5 million, which is already excluded from the $25 million noted above. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on WPSs interim fuel surcharges. A retail electric rate increase, effective January 16, 2008, which contributed an approximate $23 million increase in revenue. The full benefit of the 2007 retail electric rate increase, effective January 12, 2007, also contributed to the increase in revenue year over year. Per the PSCWs order approving the PEC merger, WPS was not permitted to increase its base rates for natural gas or electric service prior to January 1, 2009. However, WPS was allowed to adjust rates for changes in purchased power costs as well as fuel costs related to electric generation due to changes in NYMEX natural gas futures prices, delivered coal prices, and transmission costs. The increase also included recovery of deferred 2005 and 2006 MISO Day 2 costs over a one year period. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on WPSs interim rate increase. An approximate $5 million increase in revenue at UPPCO related to increased energy and transmission costs in 2008 compared with 2007. Increases in fuel and purchased power costs at UPPCO are passed directly through to customers in rates. 47 2007 Compared with 2006: Regulated electric revenue increased $146.7 million, driven by the following: On January 11, 2007, the PSCW issued a final written order to WPS authorizing a retail electric rate increase of $56.7 million (6.6%), effective January 12, 2007, for Wisconsin electric customers. In June 2006, the MPSC issued a final written order to UPPCO authorizing an annual retail electric rate increase for UPPCO of $3.8 million (4.8%), effective June 28, 2006. See Note 23, "Regulatory Environment," for more information related to the retail electric rate increases at WPS and UPPCO. On a per unit basis, fuel and purchased power costs were approximately 17% higher in 2007 compared with 2006. In addition, sales volumes increased 0.4%, primarily related to an increase in sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers, driven by warmer weather during the cooling season and colder weather during the heating season (a portion of heating load is electric) in 2007, compared with 2006. The increase in sales volumes related to weather was partially offset by an approximate 2% decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage, driven by customer conservation resulting from higher energy costs and weaker general economic conditions. Margin 2008 Compared with 2007: The regulated electric utility segment margin increased $67.8 million, driven by an increase in electric margin at WPS. The $68.4 million increase in the electric margin at WPS was a result of: A $54.0 million partial refund to Wisconsin retail customers for 2007 of their portion of proceeds from the liquidation of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, the decrease in the 2007 margin related to the refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expense in 2007 and, therefore, did not have an impact on earnings. WPS completed this refund in 2007. An approximate $10 million increase in margin from the 2008 retail electric rate increase effective January 16, 2008, and the full benefit of the 2007 retail electric rate increase effective January 12, 2007. An approximate $10 million increase in margin driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year. An approximate $5 million increase in regulated electric utility margin year over year driven by fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $1 million lower than what was recovered in rates during 2008, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $4 million higher than what was recovered in rates during 2007. As a result of approximately $23 million of under recovered fuel and purchased power costs in the first quarter of 2008, the PSCW approved an interim rate surcharge effective March 22, 2008, and subsequently approved a higher final surcharge effective July 4, 2008. The $5 million increase in electric margin includes lower fuel costs from the fuel window reset and the net impact of the refund accrued at December 31, 2008, payable in 2009 to electric customers from the reopening of the 2008 fuel surcharge on September 30, 2008, by the PSCW. 48 These increases in the electric margin were offset by an approximate $11 million decrease in margin due to a decline in residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes. Of this decrease, approximately $8 million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers, which we believe were the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown. Approximately $1 million related to decreased demand by our commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as the economy worsened. In addition, cooler weather during the 2008 cooling season compared with 2007 contributed approximately $2 million to the decrease in gross margin. 2007 Compared with 2006: The regulated electric margin increased $61.2 million, driven by the following: A $57.0 million (11.5%) increase in the electric utility margin at WPS. WPSs margin was positively impacted by the retail electric rate increases discussed above and by higher electric sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers related to weather. Favorable weather during both the heating and cooling seasons positively impacted margin by an estimated $6 million. The year over year change in WPSs margin was also positively impacted by a $16.2 million decrease in the 2006 margin related to the accrual of the refund to wholesale customers in 2006 of their portion of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, the decrease in the 2006 margin related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expenses in 2006 and, therefore, did not have an impact on earnings. No such accrual to wholesale customers occurred in 2007; however, the payment of the refund was made in 2007. Partially offsetting the increase in WPSs margin, fuel, and purchased power costs were 3.7% higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were 10.5% less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in 2006, driving a $14.4 million negative variance in WPSs electric margin. In 2007, fuel and purchased power prices were above what was projected in the rate case primarily due to higher than anticipated commodity costs and the market effects of unplanned plant outages. On October 6, 2007, lightning hit Weston 3, and the unit returned to full service on January 14, 2008. The unscheduled outage did not have a significant impact on the electric utility margin as the PSCW approved deferral of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly related to the outage. The outage did, however, cause the price of purchased power from other sources to increase. Excluding the additional purchased power which resulted from the Weston 3 outage, fuel and purchased power costs at WPS increased 17% in 2007, compared with the same period in 2006, primarily related to the higher per unit cost of fuel and purchased power required from the market to serve WPSs customers. UPPCOs margin increased approximately $4 million, primarily due to its retail electric rate increase, effective June 2006, and higher retail sales volumes. Operating Income 2008 Compared with 2007: Operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased $8.3 million, driven by the $67.8 million increase in the electric utility margin, partially offset by a $59.5 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was driven by: 49 A $54.0 million year over year increase related to the partial amortization in 2007 of the regulatory liability previously recorded for WPSs obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to Wisconsin retail electric ratepayers. A $13.8 million increase in electric transmission expenses, primarily related to higher rates charged by MISO and ATC due to additional transmission costs. A $6.1 million increase in cost of capital and depreciation expense charged by IBS for assets transferred from WPS to IBS in the beginning of 2008 and reported as operating and maintenance expense in 2008. Similar costs were reported as depreciation and amortization expense in 2007, prior to the start up of IBS. A $4.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to $9.2 million of depreciation expense from Weston 4 being placed in service for accounting purposes in April 2008, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation related to assets transferred to IBS and reported in operating and maintenance expense in 2008. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by: An $11.6 million decrease in electric maintenance expenses at WPS, primarily due to major planned outages at the Weston 2 and Weston 3 generation stations, the De Pere Energy Center, and the Pulliam generation station, as well as several unplanned outages at the Weston 3 generation station in 2007, compared with fewer outages in 2008. A decrease in external costs to achieve merger synergies of $6.6 million related to the merger with PEC, from $12.3 million in 2007, to $5.7 million in 2008. This decrease occurred primarily because all external costs to achieve merger synergies incurred from July 2006 through March 2007 were reallocated in 2007 from the holding company segment to the other reportable segments, including the regulated electric segment. These reportable segments are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve. In addition, the reduction in 2008 external costs to achieve merger synergies was due to less integration work required in 2008 compared with 2007. 2007 Compared with 2006: Operating income increased $2.2 million, driven by the $61.2 million increase in regulated electric margin discussed above, partially offset by a $54.3 million (23.7%) increase in operating and maintenance expenses at WPS, and a combined $3.2 million increase in depreciation and taxes other than income taxes at the regulated electric utilities. The change in operating and maintenance expense at WPS was primarily related to the following: Regulated electric maintenance expenses increased $15.3 million, driven by longer than anticipated planned outages and a higher number of unplanned outages year over year (which included major overhauls planned at the Weston 2 and Weston 3 generation stations and the De Pere Energy Center, planned major turbine and generator work performed at the Pulliam generation station, and several unplanned outages at the Weston 3 generation station). Regulated electric transmission expenses increased $14.2 million, primarily related to higher rates charged by MISO and ATC due to additional transmission investment. The regulated electric segment of WPS was allocated external costs to achieve merger synergies of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. 50 Amortization in 2006 of the regulatory liability recorded for WPSs obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to wholesale electric ratepayers contributed $16.2 million to the increase in WPSs operating and maintenance expense. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, the 2006 increase in operating and maintenance expense related to this refund was offset by a corresponding increase in 2006 margin and, therefore, did not have an impact on earnings. Lower pension, postretirement, and other employee benefit costs partially offset the increase in regulated electric operating and maintenance expense at WPS. An increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investment at the electric utilities, while the increase in taxes other than income taxes reflected an increase in sales year over year. Other Expense 2008 Compared with 2007: Other expense at the regulated electric utilities increased $6.6 million, driven by a $4.3 million increase in interest expense and a $2.3 million decrease in miscellaneous income. The increase in interest expense was due to higher long term borrowings at WPS, primarily utilized to fund various construction projects and to retire short term borrowing levels related to construction. The decrease in miscellaneous income was driven by: A $1.4 million decrease in interest income recognized related to the construction of transmission facilities WPS funded on ATCs behalf related to Weston 4. WPS was reimbursed for these transmission facilities by ATC in April 2008. A $1.8 million gain on the sale of a generation facility by UPPCO in July 2007. The decrease in miscellaneous income was partially offset by an increase in AFUDC related to the wind generation project. 2007 Compared with 2006: Other expense at the regulated electric utilities decreased $2.7 million, driven by a $5.1 million increase in miscellaneous income, partially offset by a $2.4 million increase in interest expense. The increase in miscellaneous income was driven by: A $2.9 million increase in interest income recognized related to the construction of transmission facilities WPS funded on ATCs behalf pending the start up of Weston 4. A $1.8 million gain on the sale of a generation facility by UPPCO in July 2007. The increase in interest expense was due to higher borrowings at WPS, primarily utilized to fund various construction projects.

Revenue 2008 Compared with 2007 Revenues increased $2.8 billion in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to increased volumes, (in part due to the merger with PEC in 2007) and higher average sales prices in 2008. Average sales prices rose in 2008 due to large market price increases from January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008. Market prices began to decline beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and continued to decline through the end of the year to levels below that of January 1, 2008. Integrys Energy Services recognizes revenue at the time energy is delivered. As a result, Integrys Energy Services is currently recognizing revenue based on the higher market prices from contracts entered into earlier in the year. 2007 Compared with 2006 Year over year, revenues increased approximately $1.8 billion. The increase was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of the addition of the nonregulated energy operations of PEC and an average increase in 2007 electric prices of over 10%. In addition to revenue and volume contributions from the merger with PEC, retail electric sales volumes and related revenue increased as a result of Integrys Energy Services new retail electric product offerings to existing markets and expansion into new retail electric markets. Wholesale electric sales volumes and revenue increased as a result of the additional wholesale origination transactions. Wholesale natural gas volumes increased as a result of an increase in the profitability of wholesale origination structured natural gas transactions throughout 2006 and into 2007. Some of these transactions 52 were entered into in prior periods for future delivery; therefore, Integrys Energy Services saw an increase in volumes in the periods in which these transactions settle. Retail natural gas volumes also increased, driven by favorable pricing compared with 2006, which encouraged new and existing customers to enter into or extend supply contracts with Integrys Energy Services. Margins Changes in commodity prices subject a portion of our nonregulated operations to earnings volatility. Integrys Energy Services uses financial instruments to economically hedge risks associated with physical transactions. The financial instruments mitigate the impacts of significant economic loss caused by fluctuations in market conditions, changing commodity prices, volumetric exposure, and other associated risks. Because derivative instruments utilized in these transactions may not qualify, or are not designated, as hedges under GAAP, reported earnings for the nonregulated energy operations segment include the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as unrealized gains or losses within margin. However, on the other side of these transactions, fluctuations in the fair value of the physical instruments that are subject to the economic hedges do not impact margin until settlement, as they do not meet the GAAP definition of derivative instruments. Integrys Energy Services margin decreased $218.4 million from 2007 to 2008 and increased $123.0 million from 2006 to 2007. The table below provides a summary of the significant items contributing to the change in margin. "Other significant items" in the table below are primarily related to timing of gain and loss recognition of certain transactions and, prior to January 1, 2008, the settlement of the derivative instruments used to protect the value of Section 29/45K federal tax credits.

See Note 21, "Fair Value," for more information. 53 Electric and Other Margins Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins decreased $180.6 million from 2007 to 2008 and increased $104.4 million from 2006 to 2007. The 2008 and 2007 electric and other margin included the negative impact of $8.8 million and $15.2 million, respectively, of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the merger with PEC. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins. Realized gains on structured origination contracts Realized gains on structured origination transactions increased $6.2 million, from $18.1 million in 2007 to $24.3 million in 2008. Origination transactions are physical, customer based agreements with municipalities, merchant generators, cooperatives, municipalities, and regulated utilities. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in existing markets with an emphasis on structured transactions with small environmentally friendly generators. Realized gains on structured origination contracts increased $11.8 million, from $6.3 million in 2006 to $18.1 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to continued growth in existing markets in the Midwest and northeastern United States, as well as expansion into the markets in the western United States. All other realized wholesale electric margin All other realized wholesale electric margin decreased $19.4 million from 2007 to 2008. In general, realized margins are impacted by trading activity in prior periods. Integrys Energy Services recognizes realized margin when the contracts actually settle, which lag as much as 12 to 24 months from the time the contract was actually entered into. The reduced volume of proprietary trading that began in 2007 continued to reduce realized margin in 2008. All other realized wholesale electric margin decreased $21.6 million from 2006 to 2007. The decrease from 2006 to 2007 is due to the overall reduced level of proprietary trading in 2007, due primarily to a decrease in electric price volatility during the first three quarters of 2007, increased emphasis on structured electric transactions in 2007, and the departure of several key traders in the third quarter of 2006. Integrys Energy Services seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and energy contract portfolios through various financial and physical instruments (such as forward contracts, options, financial transmission rights, and capacity contracts). Period by period variability in the margin contributed by Integrys Energy Services optimization strategies, generation facilities, and trading activities is expected due to changing market conditions and the timing associated with the settlement of these transactions. A diverse mix of products and markets, combined with disciplined execution and exit strategies, generally allows Integrys Energy Services to generate economic value and earnings from these activities while staying within the value at risk (VaR) limits authorized by Integrys Energy Groups Board of Directors. For more information on VaR, see Item 3, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Realized retail electric margin The realized retail electric margin increased $28.1 million from $34.2 million in 2007 to $62.3 million in 2008. The change was primarily due to the following: An increase of $19.5 million from operations in Illinois due to the addition of new customers as a result of the PEC merger and a reduced impact from purchase accounting in 2008. A $12.7 million increase due to expansion in the Mid Atlantic region and the resolution of certain regulatory issues in Northern Maine. 54 Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.4 million decrease from operations in Texas. This reduction is a result of higher ancillary costs in Texas and the effects of Hurricane Ike, which disrupted the electric infrastructure in Texas for a period of time, causing some of Integrys Energy Services customers to be without electricity or take only a fraction of their normal load during that period. The realized retail electric margin increased $15.9 million from $18.3 million in 2006 to $34.2 million in 2007. The change was primarily due to the following: A $13.9 million increase related to operations in Illinois, driven by the merger with PECs nonregulated business and the addition of new customers due to the expiration of certain regulatory provisions in the state in 2007 that effectively opened the market to nonregulated energy suppliers. A $6.0 million increase related to operations in Texas, as a result of further penetration into this market resulting from continued marketing efforts. Retail offerings in Texas first began in the third quarter of 2006. A $3.6 million increase related to operations in New England as new customers were added due to an increased sales focus in this region. Partially offsetting the increases discussed above was a $4.4 million decrease related to Michigan operations as many customers continued to return to utility suppliers as a result of high wholesale energy prices and changes in utility tariffs, which continued to make the Michigan energy market less competitive. Also offsetting these increases was a $3.3 million decrease related to operations in the state of New York, due to a change in the product mix offered to customers in response to utility rate structure changes. Retail and wholesale fair value adjustments From 2007 to 2008, Integrys Energy Services margin from electric retail and wholesale fair value adjustments decreased $176.8 million, as it recognized $137.4 million of non cash unrealized losses related to derivative instruments in 2008, compared with $39.4 million of non cash unrealized gains during 2007. From 2006 to 2007, margin from retail and wholesale fair value adjustments increased $70.8 million, from $31.4 million of non cash unrealized losses in 2006 to $39.4 million of non cash unrealized gains in 2007. The non cash unrealized gains and losses resulted from the application of GAAP derivative accounting rules to Integrys Energy Services portfolio of electric customer supply contracts, requiring that these derivative instruments be adjusted to fair market value. The derivative instruments are utilized to mitigate the price, volume, and ancillary risks associated with related customer sales contracts. These customer sales contracts are not adjusted to fair value, as they do not meet the definition of derivative instruments under GAAP, creating an accounting mismatch. As such, the non cash unrealized gains and losses related to the customer supply contracts will vary each period, with non cash unrealized gains being recognized in periods of increasing energy prices and non cash unrealized losses being recognized in periods of declining energy prices, and will ultimately reverse when the related customer sales contracts settle. Although energy prices rose approximately 20% in the first half of 2008, they declined approximately 45% in the second half of the year, which led to the recognition of large non cash unrealized losses in 2008 on these electric customer supply contracts. These unrealized losses will turnaround in future years as the contracts settle. Our mark to market activity also reflects increases in portfolio reserves in recognition of the increased risk of credit losses and reduced market liquidity. Finally, our mark to market activity was also negatively impacted as our short term cost of borrowing increased. The discount rate is a component of the fair value of our derivative portfolio and, therefore, the current increased interest rates resulted in a reduction in the fair value presented on the balance sheet. In 2007, energy prices increased, resulting in unrealized gains. 55 Oil option activity Oil option activity drove a $19.6 million decrease in electric and other margins from 2007 to 2008. There was no activity related to these oil options in 2008. Prior to 2008, oil options were utilized to protect the value of a portion of Integrys Energy Services Section 29/45K federal tax credits from 2005 to 2007. However, companies can no longer generate tax credits from the production of synthetic fuel as the provisions of Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code expired effective December 31, 2007. As a result, Integrys Energy Services exercised substantially all of its remaining oil options in 2007. Oil option activity drove a $22.0 million increase in electric and other margins from 2006 to 2007. Net mark to market and realized losses on oil options of $2.4 million were recognized in 2006, compared with net mark to market and realized gains on oil options of $19.6 million in 2007. These derivative instruments were not designated as hedging instruments and, as a result, changes in the fair value were recorded in earnings. The increase in the fair value of these instruments in 2007 over 2006 reflects increased oil prices. 2005 liquidation of electric supply contract In the fourth quarter of 2005, an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in Maine requested that Integrys Energy Services liquidate a firm contract to buy power in 2006 and 2007. At that time, Integrys Energy Services recognized an $8.2 million gain related to the liquidation of the contract and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in 2006 and 2007 to supply its customers in Maine. The cost to purchase power under the new contract was more than the cost under the liquidated contract. The liquidation and subsequent replacement of this contract resulted in a $0.9 million increase in realized wholesale electric margins from 2007 to 2008 and a $5.5 million increase in realized wholesale electric margins from 2006 to 2007. The replacement contract increased the cost of purchased power needed to serve customers in Maine by $6.4 million in 2006, compared with $0.9 million in 2007. There was no impact on electric margin in 2008. Natural Gas Margins Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins decreased $37.8 million from 2007 to 2008 and increased $18.6 million from 2006 to 2007. The 2008 and 2007 natural gas margins included the negative impact of $5.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively, of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the merger with PEC. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins. Lower of cost or market inventory adjustments The spot price of natural gas decreased significantly during the second half of 2008 (below the average cost of natural gas in inventory which Integrys Energy Services had acquired and injected earlier in 2008), which resulted in a lower of cost or market adjustment, as required by GAAP. This adjustment contributed a $160.3 million decrease in non cash realized natural gas margins from 2007 to 2008, and a $6.1 million decrease in non cash realized natural gas margins from 2006 to 2007. The negative impact on realized margin related to these inventory adjustments was offset by unrealized gains recognized in 2008 and 2007 on derivative instruments utilized to mitigate the price risk on natural gas inventory underlying natural gas storage transactions (See "Other fair value adjustments" below). Other realized natural gas margins Other realized natural gas margins increased $8.0 million, from $107.6 million in 2007, to $115.6 million in 2008, primarily related to realized gains on wholesale natural gas storage transactions. In 2008 over 2007, Integrys Energy Services increased its storage withdrawals which drove the year over year increase in other realized natural gas margins. In addition, Integrys Energy Services placed greater emphasis on structured wholesale natural gas transactions in 2008 in existing markets, which also 56 contributed to the increase. These structured transactions involve serving customers such as regulated utilities, pipelines, retail marketers, and other large end users of natural gas. Other realized natural gas margins increased $14.1 million, from $93.6 million in 2006, to $107.6 million in 2007. The majority of this increase, $5.7 million, was driven by margin contributed by the nonregulated retail natural gas marketing operations added with the PEC merger and improved supply optimization, as Integrys Energy Services was able to secure lower supply costs for firm sales commitments to retail natural gas customers in Ohio and Illinois. The remaining increase in realized natural gas margins was driven by the nonregulated wholesale natural gas marketing operations added with the PEC merger. Spot to forward differential Integrys Energy Services experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle, which runs annually from April through March of the next year. Generally, injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months. Integrys Energy Services policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with contracts in the over the counter and futures markets, effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage. However, fair market value hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices, while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices. When the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas, Integrys Energy Services experiences volatility in its earnings. Consequently, earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage. The accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions. The natural gas storage cycle had a positive $5.5 million impact on natural gas margins from 2007 to 2008. There was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in 2007 compared with a $5.5 million positive impact in 2008. At December 31, 2008, the market value of natural gas in storage was not significantly different than the market value of future sales contracts related to the 2008/2009 natural gas storage cycle. The natural gas storage cycle had a negative $0.2 million impact on natural gas margins from 2006 to 2007. There was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in 2007 compared with a $0.2 million positive impact in 2006. At December 31, 2007, the market value of natural gas in storage was $5.6 million less than the market value of future sales contracts (net unrealized loss) related to the 2007/2008 natural gas storage cycle. Other fair value adjustments Other derivative accounting required fair value adjustments primarily relate to changes in the fair market value of contracts utilized to mitigate market price risk related to certain natural gas storage contracts, as well as basis swaps utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with natural gas transportation contracts and certain natural gas sales contracts. Earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the transactions used to mitigate price risk (requiring that these derivative instruments be reflected at fair market value), without a corresponding offset related to the physical natural gas storage contracts, the natural gas transportation contracts, or the natural gas sales contracts (as these contracts are not considered derivative instruments). Therefore, there is no gain or loss recognized on the natural gas storage contracts (unless the inventory underlying these storage contracts becomes subject to lower of cost or market adjustments, as was the case in 2008, and to a lesser extent in 2007 and 2006 as well), the transportation contracts, or the customer sales contracts until physical settlement of these contracts occurs. In 2008, the impact of these fair value adjustments drove a $109.0 million increase in the natural gas margins as unrealized gains on these instruments were $147.6 million in 2008, compared with unrealized gains of $38.6 million 2007. 57 In 2007, the impact of these fair value adjustments drove a $10.8 million increase in the natural gas margins as unrealized gains on these instruments were $38.6 million in 2007, compared with unrealized gains of $27.8 million 2006. Operating Income (Loss) 2008 Compared with 2007 Operating income at Integrys Energy Services decreased $241.5 million, from $123.2 million in 2007 to a $118.3 million operating loss in 2008. This decrease resulted primarily from the $218.4 million decrease in margin discussed above. In addition, there was a $22.3 million increase in operating and maintenance expense. Operating and maintenance expense increased from $159.4 million in 2007 to $181.7 million in 2008, driven largely by a $9.1 million increase in bad debt expense, $7.3 million of which resulted from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the third quarter of 2008, a $5.1 million increase in broker commissions as a result of higher transaction volumes, and higher employee benefit costs. 2007 Compared with 2006 Operating income at Integrys Energy Services increased $40.2 million, from $83.0 million in 2006, to $123.2 million in 2007, driven by the $123.0 million increase in margin discussed above, partially offset by a $77.9 million increase in operating and maintenance expense. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by higher payroll and benefit costs related to additional employees required as a result of continued business expansion activities at Integrys Energy Services (the most significant of which related to the merger of PECs nonregulated operation into Integrys Energy Services). A $9.0 million pre tax gain on the 2006 sale of WPS ESI Gas Storage, LLC, $7.7 million of costs to achieve merger synergies and additional costs related to plant outages of $2.6 million in 2007 also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expense. Other Expense 2008 Compared with 2007 Other expense at Integrys Energy Services decreased $10.4 million, from $13.7 million in 2007 to $3.3 million in 2008. This decrease resulted primarily from an increase in miscellaneous income of $9.0 million, driven by a $13.8 million decrease in pre tax net losses related to Integrys Energy Services former investment in a synthetic fuel facility. This increase in miscellaneous income was partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in foreign currency gains related to Integrys Energy Services Canadian subsidiaries and a $3.7 million decrease in interest and dividend income on margin deposits. 2007 Compared with 2006 Other expense decreased $9.3 million, from $23.0 million in 2006, to $13.7 million in 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from a $5.7 million decrease in pre tax net losses recognized year over year related to Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel facility. Integrys Energy Services took less production from this facility in 2007 compared with 2006. A $3.8 million increase in foreign currency gains at Integrys Energy Services Canadian subsidiaries in 2007, which was offset by related losses in gross margin, also contributed to the decrease. These transactions are substantially hedged from an economic perspective, resulting in no significant impact on income (loss) available for common shareholders. 58 Minority Interest 2007 Compared with 2006: A decrease of $3.7 million in minority interest related to Integrys Energy Services synthetic fuel operations. In 2007, Integrys Energy Services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and, therefore, did not share in losses from this facility. Holding Company and Other Segment Operations Change in Change in Year Ended December 31, 2008 Over 2007 Over (Millions) 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 Operating loss $ (0.7 ) $ (11.8 ) $ (14.1 ) (94.1 )% (16.3 )% Other income (expense) 12.9 (12.3 ) 14.3 N/A N/A Income (loss) before taxes $ 12.2 $ (24.1 ) $ 0.2 N/A N/A Operating Loss 2008 Compared with 2007: Operating loss at the Holding Company and Other segment improved $11.1 million during 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease in the operating loss was driven by: Reductions in operating expenses related to consulting fees, compensation and benefits, and contractor costs at the holding company. Operating income of $1.9 million generated at IBS, which related to return on capital included in its service charges beginning in 2008. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating loss, was a $6.5 million increase in the year over year operating loss related to external costs to achieve merger synergies associated with the PEC merger. This increase occurred primarily because in March 2007 all external costs to achieve merger synergies incurred from July 2006 through March 2007 were allocated from the Holding Company and Other segment (where they were initially recorded) to the other reportable segments, which are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from these costs. This resulted in lower operating expenses at the Holding Company and Other segment during 2007. 2007 Compared with 2006: The operating loss at the Holding Company and Other segment decreased $2.3 million during 2007 compared with 2006. The change was driven by a $1.7 million decrease in operating expenses, primarily related to the reallocation of external costs to achieve merger synergies associated with the PEC merger incurred from July 2006 through March 2007. In March 2007, all external costs to achieve were reallocated from the Holding Company and Other segment (where they were initially recorded) to other reportable segments, which are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve. 59 Other Income (Expense) 2008 Compared with 2007: Other income increased $25.2 million and was driven by: A $15.6 million increase in income from Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. Integrys Energy Group recorded $66.1 million of pre tax equity earnings from ATC during 2008, compared with $50.5 million of pre tax equity earnings during 2007. ATCs earnings continue to increase due to a significant capital expansion program. A $10.5 million decrease in external interest expense due to lower interest rates and lower average short term borrowings used for working capital requirements at Integrys Energy Group. A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of PEP in September 2007 was used to pay down the short term debt. 2007 Compared with 2006: Other income decreased $26.6 million and was driven by: A $31.8 million increase in external interest expense, driven by additional borrowings assumed in the merger with PEC, as well as an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota, and transaction and transition costs related to the merger with PEC. A $6.2 million gain on the sale of Integrys Energy Groups one third interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC in April 2006 also contributed to the decrease in year over year earnings. The decrease in other income was partially offset by an $11.5 million increase in earnings from Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. Integrys Energy Group recorded $50.5 million of pre tax equity earnings from ATC during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $39.0 million for the same period in 2006. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Effective Tax Rate 29.1 % 32.2 % 22.9 % The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the impact of large permanent tax deductions pertaining to items that exceeded the related book expense being applied to the lower income before taxes in 2008, compared with 2007. In addition, in 2008 we recognized $10.0 million of investment tax credits related to solar projects completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. These were offset by the reduction in Section 29/45K tax credits in 2008 due to the December 31, 2007, expiration of Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code that made tax credits available from the production and sale of synthetic fuel. In 2007, our ownership in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in recognizing the tax benefit of Section 29/45K federal tax credits of $13.6 million compared with $0.8 million of Section 29/45K tax credits recognized in 2008. The 2007 increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a decrease in Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized in 2007 compared with 2006. The decrease in Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized was driven by the impact of high oil prices on our ability to realize the benefit of Section 29/45K federal tax credits. Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized from the production and sale of synthetic fuel were $13.6 million in 2007, compared with $29.5 million in 2006. 60 Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 2008 Compared with 2007: Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $68.6 million in 2008, compared with 2007. In the third quarter of 2008, Integrys Energy Services sold its subsidiary Mid American Power, LLC, which owned the Stoneman generation facility, located in Wisconsin. The historical revenue, expenses, and effects of disposing of this facility were not significant. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Integrys Energy Services recognized an additional $3.8 million after tax gain on the sale of this facility in discontinued operations when a previously contingent payment was paid by the buyer. This contingent payment resulted from legislation that passed in the fourth quarter of 2008, which extended the production tax credits available for certain biomass facilities. During 2007, $58.5 million of after tax income from discontinued operations was recognized related to PEP. This included an after tax gain of $7.6 million on the sale. In 2008, discontinued operations reflect the $0.8 million impact of tax adjustments related to the 2007 PEP sale. During 2007, WPS Niagara Generation, LLC recognized after tax income of $14.8 million from discontinued operations, primarily related to the $14.7 million after tax gain on the sale of this facility. 2007 Compared with 2006: Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $66.0 million, from after tax income of $7.3 million in 2006 to after tax income of $73.3 million in 2007. In September 2007, Integrys Energy Group completed the sale of PEP for approximately $879.1 million. Post closing adjustments in the amount of $9.9 million were settled in February 2008 related to this sale, which reduced the sale price to $869.2 million. These post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, $58.5 million of income from discontinued operations was recognized related to PEP, which included an after tax gain of $7.6 million on the sale. Discontinued operations, net of tax, related to WPS Niagara Generation, LLC (Niagara), which was sold in January 2007, increased $14.4 million, from income of $0.4 million in 2006 to income of $14.8 million in 2007. The increase in income generated from Niagara was mostly due to a $14.7 million after tax gain on the sale of the facility. Partially offsetting these increases were discontinued operations related to Sunbury Generation, LLC (Sunbury). Income from discontinued operations related to Sunbury was $6.9 million for the period January 1, 2006, through the date of sale in July 2006, including a $12.5 million after tax gain on the sale of this facility. For more information on the discontinued operations discussed above, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations" and Note 24, "Segments of Business." BALANCE SHEET Cash and cash equivalents increased $212.9 million, from $41.2 million at December 31, 2007, to $254.1 million at December 31, 2008. For a detailed explanation for the change in the cash and cash equivalents balance, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues increased $285.3 million (15.3%), from $1,870.0 million at December 31, 2007, to $2,155.3 million at December 31, 2008, primarily due to the following: 61 Net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues at Integrys Energy Services increased $223.6 million (20.9%), driven primarily by an increase in electric and natural gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with the same period in 2007, due mainly to higher volumes sold. Net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues at PGL increased $102.2 million (34.2%), driven primarily by an increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with the same period in 2007. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher natural gas prices. These increases were partially offset by a $72.2 million (22.1%) decrease in WPSs net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues, primarily due to an $82.3 million receivable at December 31, 2007, from ATC related to the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4 that WPS funded on ATCs behalf. WPS received payment for the ATC receivable in 2008. This decrease was partially offset by a $16.2 million year over year increase in accrued unbilled revenues. Inventories increased $69.5 million (10.5%), from $663.4 million at December 31, 2007, to $732.9 million at December 31, 2008. The inventory balance at WPS increased $33.5 million (41.2%), driven by a $22.2 million (43.4%) increase in natural gas in storage due to an increase in natural gas prices year over year, and an increase in fossil fuel inventory of $11.3 million (37.3%), primarily due to an increase in coal prices and an increase in coal quantities, related to Weston 4 becoming operational in June 2008. PGLs inventory increased $26.2 million (30.9%) due to an increase in natural gas prices and volumes year over year. At December 31, 2008, compared to December 31, 2007, total assets from risk management activities increased $1,682.4 million and total liabilities from risk management activities increased $1,767.5 million. The increase in assets and liabilities from risk management activities was driven by changes in the fair values of the underlying derivative contracts, driven by extremely volatile energy prices in 2008. Total liabilities from risk management activities also increased at PGL and NSG, primarily due to changes in the fair values of the underlying derivative contracts. Total regulatory assets increased $444.8 million (35.8%), from $1,244.0 million at December 31, 2007, to $1,688.8 million at December 31, 2008. The regulatory asset related to pension and other postretirement related items increased $412.8 million, primarily related to an increase in the unfunded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans due to decreases in the value of plan assets during 2008. Also contributing to the increase was the regulatory asset related to derivatives, which increased $127.6 million year over year, due to an increase in PGLs and NSGs net risk management liabilities arising from changes in natural gas prices. Partially offsetting these increases was the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs, which decreased $77.7 million year over year, mainly due to PGL collecting these costs in rates. See Note 7, "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities," for more information. Net property, plant, and equipment increased $309.5 million (6.9%), from $4,463.8 million at December 31, 2007, to $4,773.3 million at December 31, 2008, due primarily to the following: Net property, plant, and equipment at WPS increased $151.8 million. Capital expenditures in 2008 were $275.4 million, in part due to $71.3 million related to the construction of the Crane Creek Wind Farm, $55.6 million related to natural gas service laterals to the Guardian II natural gas transmission pipeline, $48.0 million related to the construction of Weston 4, $12.3 million related to the purchase of new line transformers, and $12.1 million related to electric and natural gas service for new and existing customers. The increase due to capital expenditures was partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $99.5 million in 2008. Net property, plant, and equipment at PGL increased $54.5 million, primarily due to capital expenditures of $113.3 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $67.4 million. Capital expenditures in 2008 related mainly to the natural gas distribution systems. Net property, plant, and equipment at Integrys Energy Services increased $47.4 million, primarily due to capital expenditures related to solar energy and landfill gas projects. 62 Accounts payable increased $202.5 million (15.2%), from $1,331.8 million at December 31, 2007, to $1,534.3 million at December 31, 2008. Accounts payable at Integrys Energy Services increased $252.8 million, primarily due to an increase in the volume of natural gas borrowed. This increase was partially offset by a $62.8 million year over year decrease in accounts payable at WPS driven by the completion of Weston 4, which became commercially operational in June 2008. WPS paid contractors related to work performed at Weston 4 during 2008 as these contracts were completed and closed out, and purchased power decreased, mainly as a result of Weston 4 becoming operational. Detailed explanations for changes in the short term and long term debt balances year over year are included in Note 11, "Short term Debt and Lines of Credit," and Note 12, "Long Term Debt." Environmental remediation liabilities decreased $65.0 million (9.2%), from $705.6 million at December 31, 2007, to $640.6 million at December 31, 2008. The decrease related mainly to expenditures for manufactured gas plant remediation at PGL. See Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information. The $388.6 million year over year increase in long term pension and other postretirement liabilities and the $101.4 million year over year decrease in pension and other postretirement assets were primarily related to a decrease in the value of plan assets during 2008 related to losses on investments, which caused an increase in the unfunded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We believe that our cash balances, liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to equity capital markets and available borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. Our borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies. Our operating cash flows and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control. Due to unprecedented volatility within the global financial markets beginning in the second half of 2008, Integrys Energy Group has been exposed to increased interest costs and challenges, at times, accessing short term capital markets. Due to disruptions in the commercial paper markets, Integrys Energy Group made draws under its syndicated revolving credit agreements for funds that would normally have been borrowed in the commercial paper market, and $300 million of these borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2008. Operating Cash Flows 2008 Compared with 2007: Net cash used for operating activities was $250.0 million in 2008, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $238.5 million in 2007. The $488.5 million year over year increase in cash used for operating activities was driven by: 63 A $498.2 million decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable collections, as colder weather conditions led to higher natural gas throughput volumes in the fourth quarter 2008, compared with the same quarter in 2007, contributing to higher accounts receivable balances. Also contributing to higher accounts receivable balances, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries, primarily Integrys Energy Services, had cash collateral payments outstanding at December 31, 2008, that were $232.9 million higher than cash collateral payments outstanding at December 31, 2007. The increase in cash collateral payments was driven by large mark to market losses incurred by Integrys Energy Services during the latter part of 2008, due to declining prices, as discussed in more detail in "Results of Operations Integrys Energy Services Operations." A $139.1 million increase in cash used for natural gas inventory purchases due to an increase in the average price of natural gas during the summer of 2008 (when natural gas is generally injected into inventory), compared with the same period in 2007. An $88.7 million decrease in net refunds of regulatory assets and liabilities, driven by a decrease in the refund to ratepayers in 2008, compared with 2007, of proceeds WPS received from the liquidation of the nonqualified decommissioning trust fund upon the sale of Kewaunee. 2007 Compared with 2006: During 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $238.5 million, compared with $72.9 million in 2006. The $165.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a $64.8 million decrease in working capital requirements year over year. It is important to note that changes in working capital balances at February 21, 2007, as a result of the PEC merger are not incorporated in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as the merger was a noncash transaction. Only PEC changes in working capital from the merger date to December 31, 2007, are included. Inventory levels at Integrys Energy Services increased from December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2007, but this change was less than the increase from December 31, 2005, to December 31, 2006, driving the majority of the decrease in working capital requirements. Integrys Energy Services continued to see growth in its natural gas business in both new and existing markets. The year over year change in natural gas inventories at the regulated utilities was not significant. The remaining increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a year over year increase in income available for common shareholders. Investing Cash Flows 2008 Compared with 2007: Net cash used for investing activities was $452.2 million in 2008, compared with $451.5 million in 2007. The $0.7 million year over year increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by a $140.2 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures (discussed below), partially offset by the reimbursement of $99.7 million from ATC, related to the construction of the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4, and a $15.5 million year over year increase in cash proceeds received from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. 2007 Compared with 2006: Net cash used for investing activities was $451.5 million in 2007, compared with $1,030.1 million in 2006. The $578.6 million decrease was driven by $659.3 million of cash used by Integrys Energy Group to acquire natural gas operations in Michigan and Minnesota in 2006. Also contributing $44.0 million to the decrease in net cash used for investing activities in 2007 was WPSs liquidation of the cash that was deposited into an escrow account in 2006, which was used for the payment of the outstanding principal balance of first mortgage bonds in January 2007 (discussed below in significant financing activities). Partially offsetting these decreases were $58.4 million of proceeds received from the sale of our 64 investment in Guardian Pipeline LLC and WPS ESI Gas Storage, LLC in 2006 and a $50.6 million year over year increase in capital expenditures (discussed below). Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 were as follows: Reportable Segment (millions) 2008 2007 2006 Electric utility $ 207.4 $ 202.6 $ 282.1 Natural gas utility 237.3 158.8 54.6 Integrys Energy Services 68.1 20.5 5.5 Holding company and other 20.0 10.7 (0.2 ) Integrys Energy Group $ 532.8 $ 392.6 $ 342.0 The increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility segment in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures at PGL and NSG due to the fact that they were not acquired until February 21, 2007, as well as construction of the natural gas lateral infrastructure that will connect WPSs natural gas distribution system to the Guardian II natural gas pipeline. The increase in capital expenditures at Integrys Energy Services in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to solar energy projects as well as the construction of a pipeline that will transport methane gas produced at a landfill for use at a chemical plant as a replacement for natural gas. The decrease in capital expenditures at the electric utility in 2007 compared with 2006 was mainly due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the construction of Weston 4. The increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility was primarily driven by capital requirements of PGL and NSG, which were acquired in the PEC merger on February 21, 2007. Capital expenditures in 2007 for PGL and NSG related mainly to the natural gas distribution systems. The increase in capital expenditures at Integrys Energy Services was due to capital required to open new offices in Colorado, Michigan, and Washington, D.C., as well as to move the Chicago office; improvements at various generation facilities; new systems infrastructure; and the Winnebago Energy Center landfill gas project. The increase in capital expenditures at the Holding Company and Other segment was driven by the purchase of a corporate airplane. Financing Cash Flows 2008 Compared with 2007: Net cash provided by financing activities was $911.3 million in 2008, compared with net cash used for financing activities of $459.2 million in 2007. In 2007, Integrys Energy Group was able to pay down short term debt with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of PEP. In 2008, proceeds were required to fund higher year over year working capital requirements. 65 2007 Compared with 2006: Net cash used for financing activities was $459.2 million in 2007, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $891.7 million in 2006. The $1.4 billion change was driven by $458.0 million of short term debt borrowings during 2006, compared with the repayment of $463.7 million of short term debt in 2007. In 2007, Integrys Energy Group was able to pay down short term debt with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of PEP. The remaining net change in financing activity was driven by a $321.8 million decrease in long term debt issuances year over year and a $119.0 million year over year decrease in common stock issued. Short term borrowings in 2006 and the long term debt and stock issuances in 2006 were used primarily for the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota. An $81.0 million increase in dividends paid in 2007, compared with 2006, was driven by an increase in shares outstanding and higher dividend rates. These items were partially offset by net natural gas loan proceeds at Integrys Energy Services of $34.4 million in 2007, compared with the net repayment of $68.4 million of natural gas loans during 2006. An increase in natural gas spreads made it more conducive to enter into natural gas loan deals in 2007 compared with 2006. Significant Financing Activities Dividends paid increased in 2008 compared with 2007. In February 2008, Integrys Energy Group increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 67 cents per share. The quarterly common stock dividend was increased from 57.5 cents per share to 66 cents per share in 2007. Integrys Energy Group had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $552.9 million and $308.2 million at December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Integrys Energy Group had short term notes payable outstanding of $181.1 million as of December 31, 2008, and $10.0 million as of December 31, 2007, respectively. Integrys Energy Group had borrowings under revolving credit facilities of $475.0 million and $150.0 million as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. See Note 11, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit" for more information. In December 2008, WPS issued $125.0 million of Series 6.375%, 7 year Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were used to fund construction costs and capital additions, retire short term indebtedness, and for general corporate utility purposes. In November 2008, Integrys Energy Group entered into an approximate $156 million short term debt agreement extending through March 2009 to finance its working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes. The agreement requires principal and interest payments to be made in yen. Integrys Energy Group entered into two forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate variability of these principal and interest payments. In November 2008, Integrys Energy Group entered into a $250 million revolving credit agreement to finance its working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, which extends to May 2009. In November 2008, PGL issued $45 million of Series SS, 7.0%, 5 year First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds and $5 million of Series TT, 8.0%, 10 year First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. The net proceeds from the issuance of these bonds were used to reduce short term debt and for general corporate utility purposes. In November 2008, NSG issued $6.5 million of Series O, 7.0%, 5 year First Mortgage Bonds. The net proceeds from the issuance of the First Mortgage Bonds were used for general corporate utility purposes. On April 17, 2008, PGL completed the purchase of $51.0 million of Illinois Development Finance Authority Series 2003D Bonds, due October 1, 2037, and backed by PGL Series PP bonds. Upon repurchase, the Auction Rate Mode was converted from a 35 day mode to a weekly variable rate mode. This transaction was treated as a repurchase of the Series PP bonds by PGL. As a result, the liability related to the Series PP bonds was extinguished. The Company intends to hold the bonds while it continues to monitor the tax exempt market and assess potential remarketing or refinancing opportunities. 66 Prior to January 1, 2008, Integrys Energy Group issued new shares of common stock under its Stock Investment Plan and under certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. As a result of the plans, equity increased $45.7 million and $25.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, Integrys Energy Group purchased shares of its common stock on the open market to meet the requirements of its Stock Investment Plan and certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. Integrys Energy Group did not repurchase any existing common stock during 2007 or 2006. In November 2007, WPS issued $125.0 million of 5.65%, 10 year Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund construction costs and capital additions, retire short term indebtedness, and for general corporate utility purposes. On December 14, 2006, the Village of Weston, Wisconsin, issued $22.0 million of 3.95% Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to WPS. In return, WPS issued $22.0 million of 3.95% Senior Notes, due in 2013, to the Village of Weston. At December 31, 2006, the $22.0 million of proceeds received from the Village of Weston were classified as restricted cash. In January 2007, WPS used the restricted cash to repay the outstanding principal balance of its 6.90% First Mortgage Bonds which originally were to mature in 2013. In December 2006, WPS issued $125.0 million of 5.55% 30 year Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund construction costs and capital additions, retire short term indebtedness, and for general corporate utility purposes. On December 1, 2006, Integrys Energy Group issued $300.0 million of Junior Subordinated Notes. Interest has been fixed at 6.22% through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps for the first ten years, after which, the interest rate will float for the remainder of the term. Credit Ratings Integrys Energy Group uses internally generated funds, commercial paper borrowings, and other short term borrowings to satisfy most of its capital requirements. Integrys Energy Group also periodically issues long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. WPS, PEC, and PGL have their own commercial paper borrowing programs. WPS periodically issues long term debt and receives equity contributions from Integrys Energy Group to reduce short term debt, fund future growth, and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the PSCW. PGL and NSG periodically issue long term debt in order to reduce short term debt, refinance maturing securities, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. The specific forms of long term financing, amounts, and timing depend on business needs, market conditions, and other factors. 67 The current credit ratings for Integrys Energy Group, WPS, PEC, PGL, and NSG are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys Integrys Energy Group Issuer credit rating Senior unsecured debt Commercial paper Credit facility Junior Subordinated Notes A BBB+ A 2 N/A BBB N/A A3 P 2 A3 Baa1 WPS Issuer credit rating First Mortgage Bonds Senior secured debt Preferred stock Commercial paper Credit facility A A+ A+ BBB+ A 2 N/A A1 Aa3 Aa3 A3 P 1 A1 PEC Issuer credit rating Senior unsecured debt A BBB+ N/A A3 PGL Issuer credit rating Senior secured debt Commercial paper A A A 2 N/A A1 P 1 NSG Issuer credit rating Senior secured debt A A N/A A1 Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy and are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. On November 25, 2008, Standard & Poors revised the outlook on Integrys Energy Group and all of its subsidiaries to negative from stable. The revised outlook reflects pressure on the current credit ratings given Integrys Energy Groups liquidity needs for its nonregulated business, as well as cash flow measures that have not met Standard & Poors expectations since the PEC merger. On March 13, 2008, Standard & Poors raised the senior secured debt rating for WPS one notch from A to A+. The new rating was a result of a review and changes made to the collateral coverage requirements Standard and Poors uses when assigning recovery ratings to United States Utility First Mortgage Bonds. In December 2007, Standard & Poors and Moodys withdrew the ratings assigned to PECs commercial paper at the request of Integrys Energy Group. On November 13, 2007, Standard & Poors revised the outlook on Integrys Energy Group and all of its subsidiaries to stable from negative. Standard & Poors outlook had been negative since February 21, 2007, for all Integrys Energy Group companies, as discussed below. The revised outlook reflected Integrys Energy Groups progress to improve its financial position and business profiles since its one notch downgrade on February 21, 2007. On November 13, 2007, Standard & Poors also reaffirmed its A rating on WPSs senior secured debt. On September 6, 2007, Standard & Poors raised the senior secured debt for NSG one notch from A to A. The new rating was the result of a review and changes made to the collateral coverage requirements Standard and Poors uses when assigning recovery ratings to United States Utility First Mortgage Bonds. On February 21, 2007, Standard & Poors lowered the corporate credit rating on Integrys Energy Group to A from A and removed it from CreditWatch with negative implications. Standard & Poors also lowered 68 Integrys Energy Groups unsecured ratings to BBB+ from A and all other issue specific ratings by one notch. Standard & Poors stated that the ratings actions were due to concerns related to plans to expand its energy marketing business, the dividend requirements resulting from the PEC merger, moderate capital expenditure requirements, lower than expected performance at MGU and MERC, uncertainty regarding future rate relief, and full integration of the newly acquired PEC utilities. At the same time, Standard & Poors lowered all WPSs issue specific ratings by one notch as they stated "WPSs liquidity is being pressured by its ongoing construction program." Standard & Poors affirmed all PEC, PGL, and NSG ratings. Standard & Poors outlook for all Integrys Energy Group related companies was negative pending successful integration of recent acquisitions. On February 21, 2007, Moodys downgraded the senior unsecured rating of Integrys Energy Group to A3 from A1, the bank credit facility to A3 from A1, the commercial paper rating to Prime 2 from Prime 1, and the Junior Subordinated Notes to Baa1 from A2. Moodys also downgraded WPSs senior secured rating to Aa3 from Aa2, its senior unsecured bank credit facility to A1 from Aa3, and its preferred stock to A3 from A2 and confirmed WPSs commercial paper rating at Prime 1. At the same time, Moodys affirmed the ratings of PGL and NSG. Moodys stated that the rating actions to downgrade were due to concerns about increases in Integrys Energy Groups consolidated debt levels and business risk profile evidenced by the increased scale and scope of the post merger non regulated energy marketing business plus the entry into the historically more challenging regulatory jurisdiction of Illinois. Moodys outlook for all Integrys Energy Group related companies is stable. On February 21, 2007, Moodys also upgraded the senior unsecured rating of PEC to A3 from Baa2, conforming it with those of Integrys Energy Group, and affirmed all other ratings for PEC. Moodys actions to upgrade the senior unsecured rating were due to the expected business risk improvement from the merger with Integrys Energy Group, which resulted in the sale of PEP and transferred PECs energy and marketing business to Integrys Energy Services, leaving PEC holding only the two regulated subsidiaries, PGL and NSG. In addition, the upgrade reflects Integrys Energy Groups guaranty of the $325.0 million of PEC 6.90% notes due in 2011. Discontinued Operations 2008 Compared with 2007: Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $3.8 million in 2008 compared with $690.2 million in 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by discontinued operations was driven by the approximate $869.2 million of proceeds received from the sale of PEP. 2007 Compared with 2006: Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $690.2 million in 2007 compared with $61.0 million in 2006. The increase in net cash provided by discontinued operations was driven by approximately $879.1 million of proceeds received from the sale of PEP in the third quarter of 2007. Post closing adjustments in the amount of $9.9 million were settled in February 2008 related to this sale, which reduced the sale price to $869.2 million. These post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at December 31, 2007 and, therefore, are included in Note 1(d), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents," as a non cash transaction. 69 Future Capital Requirements and Resources Contractual Obligations The following table shows the contractual obligations of Integrys Energy Group, including its subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2008. Payments Due By Period (Millions) Total Amounts Committed 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and Thereafter Long term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 3,622.8 $ 294.1 $ 832.4 $ 728.7 $ 1,767.6 Operating lease obligations 47.4 11.1 18.5 13.2 4.6 Commodity purchase obligations (2) 7,260.2 3,328.6 2,036.2 911.3 984.1 Purchase orders (3) 626.8 626.5 0.3 Capital contributions to equity method investment 27.3 27.3 Pension and other postretirement funding obligations (4) 545.9 54.2 141.3 163.0 187.4 Total contractual cash obligations $ 12,130.4 $ 4,341.8 $ 3,028.7 $ 1,816.2 $ 2,943.7 (1) Represents bonds issued, notes issued, and loans made to Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Integrys Energy Group records all principal obligations on the balance sheet. For purposes of this table, it is assumed that the current interest rates on variable rate debt will remain in effect until the debt matures. (2) Energy supply contracts at Integrys Energy Services included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy to customers. The utility subsidiaries expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates. (3) Includes obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations. (4) Obligations for certain pension and other postretirement benefits plans cannot be estimated beyond 2011. The table above does not reflect any payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $639.0 million at December 31, 2008, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. See Note 15,"Commitments and Contingencies," for more information about environmental liabilities. In addition, the table does not reflect any payments for the December 31, 2008 liability related to uncertain tax positions, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. See Note 14, "Income Taxes," for more information about this liability. 70 Capital Requirements Estimated construction expenditures by company for the three year period 2009 through 2011 are listed below. (Millions) WPS Wind generation projects $ 247.1 Environmental projects 171.4 Electric and natural gas distribution projects 127.6 Other projects 162.0 UPPCO Electric distribution projects and repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 70.7 MGU Natural gas pipe distribution system and underground natural gas storage facilities 26.2 MERC Natural gas pipe distribution system 43.9 PGL Natural gas pipe distribution system and underground natural gas storage facilities * 357.8 NSG Natural gas pipe distribution system 35.1 Integrys Energy Services Landfill methane gas project, infrastructure project, solar energy projects, and miscellaneous projects 43.4 IBS Corporate services infrastructure projects 83.2 Total capital expenditures $ 1,368.4 * Includes approximately $55 million of expenditures related to the accelerated replacement of cast iron mains at PGL. The expenditures were initially included in a request for recovery in a rider to PGLs 2008 rate case; however, the ICC rejected the rider. PGL again requested recovery in a rider as part of the rate case filed on February 25, 2009. Integrys Energy Group expects to provide additional capital contributions to ATC (not included in the above table) of approximately $27 million in 2009 and approximately $12 million in 2010. No capital contributions are expected in 2011. All projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2008, Integrys Energy Group and each of its subsidiaries were in compliance with all respective covenants relating to outstanding short term and long term debt and expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. 71 Integrys Energy Group and certain of its subsidiaries revolving credit agreements and term loans contain financial and other covenants, including but not limited to, a requirement to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65%, excluding non recourse debt. Failure to meet these covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and or termination of the agreements. Termination of the agreements could permit lenders to require immediate repayment of the outstanding borrowings thereunder. Integrys Energy Group and certain of its subsidiaries long term debt obligations contain covenants related to payment of principal and interest when due and various financial reporting obligations. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations. Integrys Energy Group plans to meet its capital requirements for the period 2009 through 2011 primarily through internally generated funds, net of forecasted dividend payments, and debt and equity financings. Integrys Energy Group plans to maintain current debt to equity ratios at appropriate levels to support current credit ratings and corporate growth. Management believes Integrys Energy Group has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs. See Item 7, "Management Discussion and Analysis, Other Future Considerations" for additional information. See Note 11, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit," for more information on our credit facilities and other short term credit agreements. Integrys Energy Group has the ability to publicly issue debt, equity, certain types of hybrid securities, and other financial instruments under an existing shelf registration statement, which expires in April 2009. Specific terms and conditions of securities issued will be determined prior to the actual issuance of any specific security. Integrys Energy Groups Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to $700 million of equity, debt, or other securities under this shelf registration statement, $300 million of which was used in December 2006 when Integrys Energy Group issued Junior Subordinated Notes. Integrys Energy Group plans to file a new shelf registration statement in the first quarter of 2009. In May 2008, WPS filed a shelf registration statement. As a result, WPS may issue up to $250 million of senior debt securities within the next three years with amounts, prices, and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. On December 5, 2008, WPS issued $125.0 million of 6.375%, 7 year Senior Notes under this shelf registration statement. Other Future Considerations Impact of Financial Market Turmoil Volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets has impacted Integrys Energy Group in a number of ways. Due to unprecedented volatility within the global financial markets beginning in the second half of 2008, Integrys Energy Group has been exposed to increased interest costs and challenges, at times, accessing short term capital markets. Due to disruptions in the commercial paper markets, Integrys Energy Group made draws under its syndicated revolving credit agreements for funds that would normally have been borrowed in the commercial paper market, and $300.0 million of these borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2008. In addition, we believe that a decrease in the number of wholesale counterparties actively trading in the energy markets has reduced market liquidity and increased the risk of counterparty concentrations. This factor, combined with worsening economic conditions, has also increased the risk of credit losses. A decline in the overall level of natural gas and electricity prices has resulted in increased cash margin calls on the exchanges utilized by Integrys Energy Group for economically hedging its supply obligations. In response to the factors discussed above, Integrys Energy Group has taken several steps to improve its available liquidity. In the fourth quarter of 2008, several transactions were closed in support of this effort. First, PGL issued $50.0 million of first mortgage bonds, and NSG issued $6.5 million of first mortgage 72 bonds in private placement transactions. Next, Integrys Energy Group entered into an approximate $156 million drawn credit facility extending through March 2009 and entered into a $250 million undrawn credit facility extending to May 2009. Finally, WPS issued $125 million of 7 year fading lien first mortgage bonds. In addition to the foregoing, Integrys Energy Services has adjusted its product pricing strategy to account for the increased operating costs, collateral requirements, business risks, and potential cash margining impact. This new pricing strategy has reduced the flow of new business, therefore reducing future liquidity requirements, while improving the profitability of transactions that are executed. Management believes that these efforts have reduced its exposure to adverse market conditions. While the impact of continued market volatility and the extent and impacts of any economic downturn cannot be predicted, Integrys Energy Group currently believes it has sufficient operating flexibility and access to funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity. Also, as Integrys Energy Group heads out of the winter heating season, the natural gas storage cycle at both the regulated natural gas utilities and Integrys Energy Services will aid in the generation of positive cash flow as inventory that has been built up in storage will be sold to customers. These positive cash flows will be used to reduce short term debt. The recent volatility in global capital markets has also led to a reduction in the current market value of long term investments held in Integrys Energy Groups pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts. The recent decline in asset value of the plans will likely result in higher pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, and additional future funding requirements. Impact of Divesting of or Scaling Back the Nonregulated Business Segment Integrys Energy Group has made a decision to divest of its nonregulated energy services business segment, Integrys Energy Services, or reduce its size, risk, and financial requirements in response to increased collateral requirements at a time when global credit and financial markets are constraining the availability and increasing the cost of capital. As a result, Integrys Energy Services operations will either be fully or partially divested, or scaled back to include only the most profitable products and markets, resulting in lower operating expenses and a reduced level of financial liquidity support, while invested capital will be managed downward in order to obtain an acceptable level of return. Integrys Energy Group is seeking to deploy its capital to areas with more desirable risk adjusted rates of return. Execution of this strategic decision will result in lower earnings capacity from this business segment going forward, although, in return, Integrys Energy Group expects an improved business risk profile and enhanced financial security. A divestiture of the nonregulated business segment, or a reduced segment scale, will also allow Integrys Energy Group to either eliminate or reduce the amount of credit facilities and other forms of financial support committed to Integrys Energy Services. Regulatory Matters and Rate Trends To mitigate the volatility of the price of natural gas used for electric generation, and purchased power costs in 2009 and beyond, WPS is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its PSCW approved Risk Plan and Policy, including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options. On February 1, 2007, the five utilities subject to the current Wisconsin fuel rules filed proposed changes to the fuel rules with the PSCW. The primary proposed change was to implement a 1% "dead band" to limit a utilitys annual exposure or opportunity to a maximum of 1% of fuel costs. The proposed "dead band" differs from the current trigger mechanism in that it would allow a utility to recover or refund all fuel costs outside of the band, rather than only those costs after the trigger date. A proposed rule for PSCW Chapter 116, "Cost of Fuel," was issued by the PSCW on July 3, 2008, incorporating many of the components of the utilities proposal, with a 2% bandwidth as opposed to the 1% bandwidth recommended by the utilities. WPS filed comments on the proposed fuel rules, continuing to support a true "dead band" of 1%. The PSCW will need to agree on a proposed rule that will then be forwarded to the legislature for review and promulgation. 73 In the current political, economic, and regulatory environment, the focus on energy efficiency can lead to the implementation of decoupling mechanisms. Under decoupling, utilities are allowed to adjust rates to recover or refund the difference between the actual and authorized margin impact of variations in volumes. In the recently completed WPS rate case, the PSCW approved a settlement filed by WPS and the Wisconsin Citizens Utility Board to implement decoupling for natural gas and electric residential and small commercial sales, along with several energy efficiency initiatives. In approving the settlement, the PSCW capped the annual amount that can be recovered under the decoupling mechanism to $4.0 million for natural gas service, and $12.0 million for electric service. On January 16, 2009, WPS requested rehearing to remove or increase the decoupling caps. On February 24, 2009, in a written order, the PSCW increased the caps to $8.0 million for natural gas service and $14.0 million for electric service. Recently passed legislation in Michigan authorizes the MPSC to approve decoupling mechanisms, and in its January 2009 rate order, MGU was ordered to submit a proposal for decoupling in its next rate case filing. In Minnesota, the legislature required the MPUC to evaluate decoupling. The MPUC is currently engaged in that process and has sought and received comments on decoupling mechanisms from utilities and interveners in Minnesota. Decoupling for residential and small commercial sales was approved by the ICC for PGL and NSG on a four year trial basis on February 5, 2008, and became effective March 1, 2008. Interveners, including the Illinois Attorney General, oppose decoupling, and have appealed the ICCs approval. PGL and NSG are actively supporting the ICCs decision to approve decoupling. For a discussion of regulatory filings and decisions, see Note 23, "Regulatory Environment." Uncollectible Accounts The reserves for uncollectible accounts at Integrys Energy Group reflect managements best estimate of probable losses on the accounts receivable balances. The reserves are based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors, including the impacts of the economy, energy prices, and weather. The impact of higher prices and the declining economic environment could cause more accounts receivable to become uncollectible. Higher levels of uncollectible balances would negatively impact Integrys Energy Groups results of operations and could result in higher working capital requirements. Goodwill Impairment Testing Integrys Energy Group performs its required annual goodwill impairment tests each April 1. SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires goodwill to be tested on an annual basis and between required annual testing dates if certain conditions exist. One of these conditions is a change in business climate, which may be evidenced by, among other things, a prolonged decline in a companys market capitalization below book value. Any annual or interim goodwill impairment test could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for more information on goodwill balances for Integrys Energy Groups reporting units at December 31, 2008. New Laws In February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law. ARRA contains various provisions intended to stimulate the economy. Integrys Energy Group is currently evaluating the impacts of ARRA on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations. In February 2009, Wisconsin Senate Bill (SB) 62 was signed into law. SB 62 contains various tax provisions intended to reduce Wisconsins current budget gap. Integrys Energy Group is currently evaluating the impacts of SB 62 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations. 74 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS See Note 16, "Guarantees," for information regarding guarantees. MARKET PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of Integrys Energy Services. Integrys Energy Services marketing and trading operations manage electricity and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments. Derivative instruments are utilized in these operations. Integrys Energy Services measures the fair value of derivative instruments on a mark to market basis. The fair value is included in assets or liabilities from risk management activities on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets, with an offsetting entry to other comprehensive income (for the effective portion of cash flow hedges), also on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets, or to earnings. The following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of Integrys Energy Services assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the year ended December 31, 2008. Integrys Energy Services Mark to Market Roll Forward (Millions) Oil Options Natural Gas Electric Total Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2007 (1) $ (0.2 ) $ 89.5 $ 42.8 $ 132.1 Less: Contracts realized or settled during period (2) (0.2 ) (68.1 ) 165.6 97.3 Plus: Changes in fair value of contracts in existence at December 31, 2008 (3) 136.4 (12.6 ) 123.8 Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2008 (1) $ $ 294.0 $ (135.4 ) $ 158.6 (1) Reflects the values reported on the balance sheets for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates. (2) Includes the value of contracts in existence at December 31, 2007, that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of December 31, 2008. (3) Includes unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at December 31, 2007, and contracts that were entered into subsequent to December 31, 2007, which were included in Integrys Energy Services portfolio at December 31, 2008, as well as gains and losses at the inception of contracts. There were, in many cases, derivative positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period. The realized gains or losses from these derivative positions are not reflected in the table above. The table below shows Integrys Energy Services risk management instruments categorized by fair value hierarchy levels and by maturity. For more information on the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1(t), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fair Value." 75 Integrys Energy Services Risk Management Contract Aging at Fair Value As of December 31, 2008 (Millions) Fair Value Hierarchy Level Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity in Excess of 5 years Total Fair Value Level 1 $ (74.4 ) $ (34.7 ) $ 0.5 $ (0.5 ) $ (109.1 ) Level 2 146.3 (49.6 ) (4.5 ) (3.4 ) 88.8 Level 3 76.3 82.6 12.3 7.7 178.9 Total fair value $ 148.2 $ (1.7 ) $ 8.3 $ 3.8 $ 158.6 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Integrys Energy Group has determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of its financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. Integrys Energy Groups management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Risk Management Activities Integrys Energy Group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. At December 31, 2008, those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities. If the derivatives qualify for regulatory deferral subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the contracts. In addition, Integrys Energy Group may apply the normal purchases and sales exception, provided by SFAS No. 133, as amended, to certain derivative contracts. The normal purchases and sales exception provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts. Cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when Integrys Energy Group enters into contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases. In addition, Integrys Energy Group uses cash flow hedge accounting to protect against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting may be used when Integrys Energy Group holds assets, liabilities, or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates. To the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged, there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge. Derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of SFAS No. 133, as amended, are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Integrys Energy Group. Changes in fair value, except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral, generally affect income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled. In conjunction with the implementation of SFAS No. 157, on January 1, 2008, Integrys Energy Group categorized its fair value measurements into three levels within a fair value hierarchy. See Note 1(t), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fair Value," and Note 21, "Fair Value," for more information. 76 Integrys Energy Group has based its valuations on observable inputs whenever possible. However, at times, the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs. These valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management assets on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets, $755.4 million (25.3%) utilized Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management liabilities, $573.4 million (19.4%) utilized Level 3 measurements. Integrys Energy Group believes these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date; however, the actual amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets. As a component of the fair value determination, Integrys Energy Group considers counterparty credit risk (including its own credit risk) and liquidity risk. The liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available. Under SFAS No. 157, beginning January 1, 2008, Integrys Energy Services no longer includes transaction costs in these fair value determinations, but included this in determining fair value prior to 2008. Changes in the underlying assumptions for these components of fair value at December 31, 2008, would have the following effects: Change in Components Effect on Fair Value of Net Risk Management Assets at December 31, 2008 (Millions) 100% increase $34.5 decrease 50% decrease $17.3 increase These hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as part of nonregulated revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income, unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, in which case potential changes would be included in Other Comprehensive Income Cash Flow Hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholders Equity. Purchase Accounting The 2007 PEC merger, as well as the acquisitions of natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota in 2006, were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Under this statement, the purchase price paid by the acquirer, including transaction costs, is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date based on their fair values. The per share fair value of the common stock issued by Integrys Energy Group for the acquisition of PEC was determined by using the average market value of Integrys Energy Groups common stock over a five day period, beginning two days before the announcement date of the merger. As Integrys Energy Group announced its intent to sell PEP at the time of the closing of the merger, the PEP assets and liabilities were reported at estimated fair value less costs to sell. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Assumptions may be incomplete, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results. As discussed below within "Asset Impairment," a significant amount of goodwill resulted from these acquisitions, which requires impairment testing on at least an annual basis. Goodwill was allocated to the various segments based on the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net identifiable assets. In conjunction with the PEC merger, a significant fair value estimate related to nonderivative commodity contracts and customer relationships, which were recorded as intangible assets at Integrys Energy Services. The intangible asset related to the contracts is being amortized into earnings as the contracts settle, and the intangible asset related to customer relationships is being amortized over the estimated lives of those relationships. The amortization of these items had a negative impact on earnings in 2008. 77 PGL, NSG, MGU, and MERC are predominantly regulated utilities; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, the carrying value of the majority of their assets and liabilities approximated fair value, and as such, did not change significantly as a result of applying purchase accounting. Asset Impairment Integrys Energy Group reviews certain assets for impairment as required by SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets," and SFAS No. 142. The carrying value of goodwill by segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 was: (Millions) Carrying Value of Goodwill WPS (1) $ 36.4 PGL (2) 549.3 NSG (2) 74.3 MERC (3) 144.3 MGU (3) 122.7 Total Gas Segment $ 927.0 Integrys Energy Services (2) 6.9 Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 933.9 (1) Related to the acquisition of Wisconsin Fuel and Light in 2001. (2) Related to the PEC merger in 2007. (3) Related to the acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota in 2006. The goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 1 or more frequently when events or circumstances warrant based on the guidance of SFAS No. 142. The test for impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each reporting unit using assumptions about future profitability. Key assumptions used in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, long term growth rates, return on equity, financial forecasts, capital expenditures, and other factors. A significant decrease in market values and or projected future cash flows could result in an impairment loss. In 2008, an after tax goodwill impairment loss of $6.5 million was recognized for NSG, related to a decrease in forecasted results and worsening economic factors. (See Note 9, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for further discussion of the impairment). The review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to Integrys Energy Services than to our other segments because of its lack of access to rate setting based on cost of service that is available to our regulated segments. At December 31, 2008, the carrying value of Integrys Energy Services property, plant, and equipment totaled $187.5 million. Integrys Energy Group believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing, production costs, capital expenditures, and generation volumes and (2) the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position or results of operations. Managements assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The primary estimates used at Integrys Energy Services in the impairment analyses are future revenue streams, capital expenditures, environmental landscape, and operating costs. A combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams. Integrys Energy Services forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs. These estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in SFAS No. 144. 78 Integrys Energy Services evaluates property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. These indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets, and significant negative industry or economic trends. SFAS No. 144 requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a companys asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. For assets held for sale, impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value (or fair value less costs to sell if held for sale). Throughout 2008, Integrys Energy Services tested various power plants for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that a test was required in compliance with SFAS No. 144. No material impairment charges were recorded in 2008 as a result of the recoverability tests. Results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future results given the nature of the accounting estimates involved, as discussed more fully above. Future results or changes in assumptions could result in an impairment. Receivables and Reserves Our regulated natural gas and electric utilities and Integrys Energy Services accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services rendered but not yet billed. Estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of factors based on customer class. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Integrys Energy Groups unbilled revenues were $525.5 million and $464.7 million, respectively. Any difference between actual revenues and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period. Differences historically have not been significant. With the exception of WPS, Integrys Energy Group records reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet. At WPS, the PSCW follows the direct write off approach in rates rather than the allowance method; therefore, a regulatory asset is debited rather than an expense account when the reserve for uncollectible accounts is set up. Actual write offs at WPS are charged directly to an expense account in lieu of the reserve account. At the utilities, the reserves are based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors, including the impacts of the economy, commodity prices, and weather. Each quarter, the utilities evaluate the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the most current available information and adjust the reserves for changes in estimated probable accounts receivable losses. Integrys Energy Services calculates the reserve for potential uncollectible customer receivable balances by applying an estimated bad debt experience rate to each past due aging category and reserving for 100% of specific customer receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible. The basis for calculating the reserve for receivables from wholesale counterparties considers netting agreements, collateral, and guarantees. If the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect, or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults, there could be significant changes to bad debt expense and the uncollectible reserve balance. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Integrys Energy Groups reserve for uncollectible accounts was $62.5 million and $56.0 million, respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, described in Note 17, "Employee Benefit Plans," are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, discount rates 79 used in determining the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Integrys Energy Groups pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. Management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process. The following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported annual pension cost on the income statement. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percentage Point Change in Assumption Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation Impact on 2008 Pension Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 60.0 $ 1.2 Discount rate 0.5 (57.2 ) (2.0 ) Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 5.9 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (5.9 ) The following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and the reported annual other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percentage Point Change in Assumption Impact on Postretirement Benefit Obligation Impact on 2008 Postretirement Benefit Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 25.7 $ 2.2 Discount rate 0.5 (24.2 ) (2.9 ) Health care cost trend rate (1.0 ) (46.0 ) (9.0 ) Health care cost trend rate 1.0 55.5 9.4 Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 1.1 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (1.1 ) Integrys Energy Group has developed an interest rate yield curve to enable it to make judgments pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. D 36, "Selection of Discount Rates Used for Measuring Defined Benefit Pension Obligations and Obligations of Post Retirement Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions." The yield curve is comprised of non callable (or callable with make whole provisions), high quality corporate bonds with maturities between 0 and 30 years. The included bonds are generally rated by Moodys as Aaa and Aa with a minimum amount outstanding of $50 million. The expected annual benefit cash flows are discounted for each of Integrys Energy Groups pension and retiree welfare plans using this yield curve, and a single point discount rate is developed matching each plans expected payout structure. Integrys Energy Group establishes its expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long term rate of return was 8.5% in 2008, 2007, and 2006. For 2008, 2007, and 2006, the actual rates of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, were (25.9%), 6.2%, and 11.3%, respectively. The determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. Cumulative gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages. Changes in fair value are recognized over the 80 subsequent five years for plans previously sponsored by WPS, while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for plans previously sponsored by PEC. Because of this method, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value. In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. More information on health care cost trend rates can be found in Note 17, "Employee Benefit Plans." For a table showing future payments that Integrys Energy Group expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 17, "Employee Benefit Plans." Regulatory Accounting The electric and natural gas utility segments of Integrys Energy Group follow SFAS No. 71, and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings at the utility segments, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the rate recovery period. If recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income. If our regulated electric and natural gas utility segments or a separable portion of those segments would no longer meet the criteria for application of SFAS No. 71, we would discontinue its application as defined under SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of SFAS No. 71." Assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet, but rather would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write off of all of Integrys Energy Groups regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2008, would result in an 11.9% decrease in total assets and a 3.0% decrease in total liabilities. See Note 7, "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities," for more information. Environmental Activities Relating to Former Manufactured Gas Operations Integrys Energy Groups utility subsidiaries, their predecessors, and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple manufactured gas plant sites for the purpose of manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas. The utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs incurred in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas plant sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities. The amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and managements best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites. Managements estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs. Management considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs, and the extent of recovery from other potential responsible parties. See Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies," for further discussion of environmental matters. 81 Tax Provision As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in the Consolidated Income Statements. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret them differently. As of January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FAS 109." As allowed under Interpretation No. 48, Integrys Energy Group elected to change its method of accounting to record interest and penalties paid on income tax obligations as a component of income tax expense. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and technical interpretations of applicable tax law and regulation across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on Integrys Energy Groups financial condition and results of operations. See Notes 1(p) "Income Taxes," and 14, "Income Taxes," for a discussion of accounting for income taxes. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and report operating results in terms of historic cost. The statements provide a reasonable, objective, and quantifiable statement of financial results, but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation. For our regulated operations, to the extent we are not recovering the effects of inflation, we will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions. Our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs. 82 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks and Other Significant Risks Integrys Energy Group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk (including regulatory recovery risk), interest rate risk, equity return and principal preservation risk, and foreign currency exchange rate risk. Integrys Energy Group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which we operate. Integrys Energy Group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures, as further described below. Commodity Price Risk and Regulatory Recovery Risk Utilities The electric utilities of Integrys Energy Group purchase natural gas and coal for use in power generation. They also buy and sell power from the MISO market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation. Prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by UPPCO and by the wholesale electric operations and Michigan retail electric operations of WPS. The costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utility subsidiaries are generally also recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms. These recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities. WPSs Wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations, but biennial rate cases with fuel adjustments have mitigated the year to year price risk. For intra year price risk, a "fuel window" mechanism is used to recover costs resulting from significant price volatility. Under the fuel window, if actual fuel and purchased power costs deviate by more than 2% from costs included in the rates charged to customers, a rate review can be triggered. Once a rate review is triggered, rates may be reset (subject to PSCW approval) for the remainder of the year to recover or refund, on an annualized basis, the projected change in the cost of fuel and purchased power. To manage commodity price risk, our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and electricity. In addition, the electric operations of WPS and the natural gas operations of WPS, PGL, NSG, and MERC employ risk management techniques, which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps, futures, and options. Integrys Energy Services As part of its trading activities, Integrys Energy Services seeks to generate profits from the volatility of the price of electricity by purchasing or selling various financial and physical instruments (such as forward contracts, options, financial transmission rights, and capacity contracts) in established wholesale markets where Integrys Energy Services has market expertise, under risk management policies set by management and approved by Integrys Energy Groups Board of Directors. Integrys Energy Services also seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and customer contract portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments. To measure commodity price risk exposure, Integrys Energy Group employs a number of controls and processes, including a value at risk (VaR) analysis of its exposures. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio (primarily natural gas and power positions), which also includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet. The VaR calculation excludes the long dated positions created by owning merchant generation and associated coal, sulfur dioxide emission allowances, and other ancillary fuels. Additionally, financial 83 transmission rights, renewable energy credits, and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the VaR calculation. The capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions would result in a VaR that would not be representative of the actual exposure. Therefore, Integrys Energy Services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions which would represent the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract. VaR is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors, within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period. VaR models are relatively sophisticated. However, the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model. The instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used. VaR is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. In addition to VaR, Integrys Energy Services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations, stress testing, and scenario based testing. In conjunction with the VaR analysis, these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for Integrys Energy Services risk exposure. Additionally, Integrys Energy Services also uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements. VaR has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results. Most importantly, VaR does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio. Price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported VaR. Large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions. Also, the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions. Short term reductions in market liquidity could cause Integrys Energy Services to hold positions open longer than anticipated, resulting in greater than predicted losses. Additionally, there are other risks not captured by the VaR metric including, but not limited to, the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which Integrys Energy Services transacts. Customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses, realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of our counterparties are not met. Market liquidity risk refers to the risk that Integrys Energy Services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions. Integrys Energy Services VaR is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a 95% confidence level, as well as a ten day, 99% confidence level. The delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods, such as one day or ten days, are normally distributed. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options, as well as natural gas inventory, natural gas storage, and transportation contracts, to the extent such positions are significant, but excludes the positions mentioned above. The VaR for Integrys Energy Services trading portfolio at a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table: (Millions) 2008 2007 As of December 31 $ 1.3 $ 0.9 Average for 12 months ended December 31 1.4 1.1 High for 12 months ended December 31 2.3 1.3 Low for 12 months ended December 31 0.9 0.9 The VaR for Integrys Energy Services trading portfolio at a 99% confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented below: 84 (Millions) 2008 2007 As of December 31 $ 5.6 $ 5.2 Average for 12 months ended December 31 6.2 5.1 High for 12 months ended December 31 10.2 5.6 Low for 12 months ended December 31 4.8 4.2 The average, high, and low amounts were computed using the VaR amounts at each of the four quarter ends. Interest Rate Risk Integrys Energy Group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. Integrys Energy Group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so. Integrys Energy Group may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. Due to increases in short term borrowings in the last year, Integrys Energy Group has increased its exposure to variable interest rates. Based on the variable rate debt of Integrys Energy Group outstanding at December 31, 2008, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased annual interest expense by $11.7 million. Comparatively, based on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased interest expense by approximately $6.5 million. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period. Equity Return and Principal Preservation Risk Integrys Energy Group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds. The trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. Declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and possible future required contributions for the pension plans. Integrys Energy Group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices. Most of the employee benefit costs relate to Integrys Energy Groups regulated utilities. As such, the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates, mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures. During 2008, Integrys Energy Group closed its qualified pension plans to non union new hires, and to PGLs and NSGs union new hires. In April 2009, the plans will also be closed to UPPCOs union new hires. This will reduce future exposure to equity return and principal preservation risk. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Integrys Energy Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of operations owned and operated in Canada and transactions denominated in Canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity by Integrys Energy Services. In addition, Integrys Energy Group has a Japanese yen denominated term loan that matures on March 30, 2009. Forward foreign exchange contracts are utilized to manage the risk associated with certain transactions denominated in Canadian dollars, as well as the risk associated with the yen denominated loan. Integrys Energy Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk was not significant at December 31, 2008, or 2007. 85
