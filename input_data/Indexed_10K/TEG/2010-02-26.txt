ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Integrys Energy Group is a diversified energy holding company with regulated electric and natural gas utility operations (serving customers in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), nonregulated energy operations, and an approximate 34% equity ownership interest in ATC (a federally regulated electric transmission company operating in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois). Strategic Overview Integrys Energy Groups goal is to create long term value for shareholders and customers through growth in its core regulated businesses. Integrys Energy Group has substantially completed its previously announced strategy to divest of or significantly reduce the size of its nonregulated energy services business segment to a smaller segment with significantly reduced credit and collateral support requirements. The essential components of Integrys Energy Groups business strategy are: Maintaining and Growing a Strong Regulated Utility Base A strong regulated utility base is essential to maintain a strong balance sheet, predictable cash flows, a desired risk profile, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings. This is critical to Integrys Energy Groups success as a strategically focused regulated business. Integrys Energy Group believes the following projects have helped, or will help, maintain and grow its regulated utility base and meet its customers needs: WPSs continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators. Capital projects to construct and or upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year. Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC, a transmission company that had over $2.8 billion of transmission assets at December 31, 2009. ATC plans to invest approximately $2.5 billion during the next ten years. Although ATCs equity requirements to fund its capital investments will primarily be met by earnings reinvestment, Integrys Energy Group plans to continue to fund its share of the equity portion of future ATC growth, as necessary. An accelerated annual investment in natural gas distribution facilities (replacement of cast iron mains) at PGL. WPSs purchase of the 99 megawatt Crane Creek wind generation project constructed in Howard County, Iowa, which became operational in 2009. For more detailed information on Integrys Energy Groups capital expenditure program, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources, Capital Requirements." Operating a Nonregulated Energy Services Business Segment with a Controlled Risk and Capital Profile Through its nonregulated Integrys Energy Services subsidiary, Integrys Energy Group provides retail natural gas and electric products to end use customers in the upper Midwest and Northeastern regions of the United States. Integrys Energy Group has repositioned this subsidiary from a focus on significant growth in wholesale and retail markets across the United States and Canada, to a focus on selected retail markets with the expectation that recurring customer based business will result in dependable cash and earnings contributions with a reduced risk and capital profile. In addition, Integrys Energy Services will continue to invest in energy assets with renewable attributes. 29 Integrating Resources to Provide Operational Excellence Integrys Energy Group is committed to integrating resources of all its businesses, while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and lowering costs. Integrys Energy Group believes the following recent developments have helped, or will help, integrate resources and provide operational excellence: IBS, a wholly owned service company of Integrys Energy Group, was formed to achieve consolidation and efficient delivery of various support services, and to provide more consistent and transparent allocation of costs throughout Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. "Operational Excellence" initiatives were implemented to provide top performance in the areas of project management, process improvement, contract administration, and compliance in order to reduce costs and manage projects and activities within appropriate budgets, schedules, and regulations. Placing Strong Emphasis on Asset and Risk Management Integrys Energy Groups asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of existing assets, the acquisition of assets, and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement its existing business and strategy. The goal is to provide the most efficient use of resources while maximizing return and maintaining an acceptable risk profile. This strategy focuses on the disposition of assets, including property, plant, and equipment and entire business units, which are no longer strategic to ongoing operations, are not performing as needed, or have an unacceptable risk profile. Integrys Energy Group maintains a portfolio approach to risk and earnings. Integrys Energy Groups decision regarding the future of Integrys Energy Services illustrates its asset management strategy. Integrys Energy Groups risk management strategy includes the management of market, credit, and operational risks through the normal course of business. Forward purchases and sales of electric capacity, energy, natural gas, and other commodities and the use of derivative financial instruments, including commodity swaps and options, allow for opportunities to reduce the risk associated with price movement in a volatile energy market. Each business unit manages the risk profile related to these instruments consistent with Integrys Energy Groups risk management policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Risk Management Group, which reports through the Chief Financial Officer, provides corporate oversight. Continuing Emphasis on Safe, Reliable, Competitively Priced, and Environmentally Sound Energy and Energy Related Services Integrys Energy Groups mission is to provide customers with the best value in energy and energy related services. By effectively operating a mixed portfolio of generation assets and investing in new generation and natural gas distribution assets, while maintaining or exceeding environmental standards, Integrys Energy Group is able to provide a safe, reliable, value priced service to its customers. Integrys Energy Group concentrates its efforts on improving and operating efficiently in order to reduce costs and maintain a low risk profile. Integrys Energy Group actively evaluates opportunities for increasing its focus on energy efficiency and for adding more renewable generation to provide additional environmentally sound energy to its portfolio. Integrys Energy Group believes the following activities have helped, and will continue to help, to provide safe, reliable, competitively priced, and environmentally sound energy and energy related services: Managing operations to minimize the impact on the environment. WPSs Weston 4 facility, completed in 2008, is one of the most efficient pulverized coal fired electric generation units in the country with state of the art environmental controls, which allows reductions in the amount of emissions produced. Integrys Energy Group also expects to maintain or decrease the amount of greenhouse gases released over time and supports research and development initiatives that will enable further progress toward decreasing its carbon footprint. Effectively operating a mixed portfolio of generation assets and investing in new generation and distribution assets, such as Weston 4, wind projects, and its natural gas connection to the Guardian II pipeline, ensures continued reliability for Integrys Energy Groups customers. 30 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31 (Millions, except per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Change in 2009 Over 2008 Change in 2008 Over 2007 Natural gas utility operations $ (172.1 ) $ 84.5 $ 28.7 N/A 194.4 % Electric utility operations 88.9 92.6 87.4 (4.0 )% 5.9 % Integrys Energy Services operations 2.5 (61.5 ) 98.0 N/A N/A Electric transmission investment 45.5 39.7 30.3 14.6 % 31.0 % Holding company and other operations (35.7 ) (28.9 ) (49.1 ) 23.5 % (41.1 )% Oil and natural gas operations 56.0 N/A (100.0 )% Net income (loss) attributed to common shareholders $ (70.9 ) $ 126.4 $ 251.3 N/A (49.7 )% Basic earnings (loss) per share $ (0.92 ) $ 1.65 $ 3.51 N/A (53.0 )% Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.92 ) $ 1.64 $ 3.50 N/A (53.1 )% Average shares of common stock Basic 76.8 76.7 71.6 0.1 % 7.1 % Diluted 76.8 77.0 71.8 (0.3 )% 7.2 % Financial Results 2009 Compared with 2008 Integrys Energy Group recognized a net loss attributed to common shareholders of $70.9 million ($0.92 net loss per share) in 2009 compared with net income attributed to common shareholders of $126.4 million ($1.64 diluted earnings per share) in 2008. Significant factors impacting the $197.3 million decrease in earnings were as follows (and are discussed in more detail thereafter). Earnings at the regulated natural gas utility segment decreased $256.6 million, driven by a $242.3 million increase in after tax non cash goodwill impairment losses period over period. A $16.2 million after tax decrease in margin from lower period over period volumes, net of decoupling, also negatively impacted earnings. An $8.0 million after tax increase in employee benefit costs, a $9.6 million after tax increase in other operating and maintenance expenses related primarily to natural gas maintenance costs and workers compensation claims, and $4.1 million after tax of restructuring costs related to workforce reductions also contributed to the decrease in earnings. These negative impacts were partially offset by a $17.4 million after tax net positive impact that increased rates at certain natural gas utilities had on margin and a $10.6 million after tax decrease in bad debt expense. Earnings at the regulated electric utility segment decreased $3.7 million, driven by a $20.2 million after tax increase in operating expenses, including restructuring costs, a $3.7 million after tax increase in other expense primarily related to an increase in interest expense at WPS, and a $3.3 million increase in income taxes. Partially offsetting these increases in expenses was a $23.8 million after tax increase in margin. Earnings at Integrys Energy Services increased $64.0 million, driven by a $127.3 million after tax increase in Integrys Energy Services margin year over year, primarily related to the positive year over year impact of inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods, partially offset by non cash accounting losses due to derivative fair value adjustments. Partially offsetting the increase in Integrys Energy Services margin were an increase in the provision for income taxes, primarily due to an $18.4 million year over year decrease in income tax credits recognized, after tax restructuring expenses of $17.4 million, after tax losses of $17.3 million related to dispositions completed in connection with the strategy change primarily driven by timing differences caused by the accounting treatment for derivative and non derivative contracts, and an after tax increase in operating and maintenance expenses of $5.5 million. 31 Earnings at the electric transmission investment segment increased $5.8 million year over year, due to an increase in income from Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. Net loss at the holding company and other segment increased $6.8 million, driven by an increase in interest expense. Financial Results 2008 Compared with 2007 Integrys Energy Group recognized net income attributed to common shareholders of $126.4 million ($1.64 diluted earnings per share) in 2008 compared with $251.3 million ($3.50 diluted earnings per share) in 2007. Significant factors impacting the $124.9 million decrease in earnings were as follows (and are discussed in more detail thereafter). Earnings at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased $55.8 million, driven by the inclusion of PGL and NSG for all of 2008 compared with only a partial year of operations in 2007 and by the positive impact of PGLs 2008 rate increase. From 2007 to 2008, earnings related to PGL and NSG increased $43.3 million. Also positively impacting earnings was an increase in natural gas sales volumes at WPS, MERC, and MGU, which drove a $6.6 million after tax increase in margin. Earnings at the regulated electric utility segment increased $5.2 million, driven by a $7.0 million after tax decrease in electric maintenance expenses, an approximate $6 million after tax positive impact related to retail electric rate increases, and an approximate $6 million after tax increase in wholesale margins, partially offset by an $8.3 million after tax increase in electric transmission expenses and an approximate $7 million after tax decrease in margin due to lower residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes as a result of cooler weather during the cooling season and customer conservation efforts. Earnings at Integrys Energy Services decreased $159.5 million, driven by a $131.0 million after tax decrease in Integrys Energy Services margin year over year, primarily related to non cash accounting losses due to derivative fair value and inventory valuation adjustments, partially offset by an increase in retail electric margin. Also contributing to the decrease in Integrys Energy Services earnings was a $13.4 million after tax increase in operating and maintenance expenses, the year over year impact of the recognition of $17.1 million of after tax earnings from Integrys Energy Services investment in a synthetic fuel production facility in 2007, and a $10.9 million decrease in after tax income from discontinued operations as a result of the sale of Niagara Generation, LLC in 2007. Partially offsetting the decrease in earnings was the recognition of $10.0 million of investment tax credits related to solar projects completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. Earnings at the oil and natural gas operations segment decreased $56.0 million. In connection with the PEC merger, Integrys Energy Group announced its intent to divest of PECs oil and natural gas production operations, PEP. PEP was sold in the third quarter of 2007. In 2007, PEP recognized earnings of $56.0 million, including $58.5 million of earnings reported as discontinued operations. The sale of PEP resulted in a $7.6 million after tax gain in 2007. Earnings at the electric transmission investment segment increased $9.4 million year over year, due to an increase in income from Integrys Energy Groups ownership interest in ATC. Net loss at the holding company and other segment decreased $20.2 million, driven by lower operating expenses at the holding company, partially offset by the negative year over year impact on operating income of the reallocation of external costs to achieve merger synergies in 2007. 32 Diluted earnings per share was impacted by a 5.2 million share (7.2%) increase in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of Integrys Energy Group common stock from 2007 to 2008. Integrys Energy Group issued 31.9 million shares of common stock on February 21, 2007, in conjunction with the PEC merger. Additional shares were also issued under the Stock Investment Plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans in 2007. Utility Operations For 2009 and 2008, utility operations included the regulated natural gas utility segment, consisting of the natural gas operations of PGL, WPS, MERC, MGU, and NSG, and the regulated electric segment, consisting of the regulated electric operations of WPS and UPPCO. The regulated natural gas operations of WPS, MERC, and MGU were included in results of operations for all of 2007, while the regulated natural gas operations of PGL and NSG were included in results of operations beginning on February 22, 2007.

(3) Not meaningful as the PEC merger was completed on February 21, 2007. 33 2009 Compared with 2008 Revenues Regulated natural gas utility segment revenue decreased $788.4 million, driven by: An approximate $648 million decrease in revenue as a result of an approximate 30% decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold by the regulated natural gas utilities during 2009 compared with 2008. For all of Integrys Energy Groups regulated natural gas utilities, prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in current rates. An approximate $166 million decrease in revenue as a result of lower year over year natural gas throughput volumes, driven by: An approximate $83 million decrease related to lower overall volumes, including residential customer volumes, resulting from customer conservation and efficiency efforts. Lower volumes were also driven by decreased commercial and industrial customer volumes resulting from reduced demand related to changes in customers plant operations and a decline in customer base at PGL and MGU, both of which Integrys Energy Group attributed to the general economic slowdown. An approximate $70 million decrease as a result of warmer year over year weather during the heating season as indicated by the 2.7% decrease in average heating degree days. An approximate $19 million decrease related to a reduction in volumes sold to the electric utility segment driven by the availability of lower cost power from MISO, resulting in a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by the $6 million positive impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for PGL and NSG on March 1, 2008, and for WPS on January 1, 2009. Under decoupling, these utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction. An approximate $20 million year over year net decrease in revenue from lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at PGL and NSG related to former manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by higher recovery of EEP expenses. The EEP program was established in the 2008 PGL and NSG rate cases and is designed to encourage energy efficiency initiatives. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by the approximate $29 million year over year net positive impact of natural gas distribution rate cases and changes in rate design at the regulated natural gas utilities. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on these rate cases. Effective January 14, 2009, MGU received a final rate order from the MPSC for a natural gas distribution rate increase. On June 29, 2009, MERC received a final rate order granting a natural gas distribution rate increase. Prior to this final order, MERC had been granted interim rate relief effective October 1, 2008. Together, these rate increases had an approximate $19 million positive impact on revenue. In 2009, PGL and NSG received the full impact of their 2008 natural gas distribution rate orders, which were effective February 14, 2008, and drove an approximate $5 million increase in revenue year over year. Effective January 1, 2009, the PSCW required WPS to change its retail natural gas distribution rate design which incorporates higher volumetric rates and lower fixed customer charges. In 2009, revenue increased approximately $5 million related to this change in rate design. 34 Margins Regulated natural gas utility segment margin decreased $22.7 million, driven by: An approximate $27 million year over year decrease in margin resulting from the 9.0% decrease in natural gas throughput volumes attributed to the negative impact of the general economic slowdown, customer conservation and efficiency efforts, and warmer year over year weather. This decrease in margin includes the impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for PGL and NSG on March 1, 2008, and for WPS on January 1, 2009. The decoupling mechanism for WPSs natural gas utility includes an annual $8.0 million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin. Approximately $7 million of additional margin was recognized at WPS due to a shortfall from the rate case authorized margin during 2009. An approximate $20 million year over year net decrease in margin due to lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at PGL and NSG related to former manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by an increase in recovery of EEP expenses. This decrease in margin was offset by a net decrease in operating expense from both the amortization of the related regulatory asset and EEP expenses and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. An approximate $2 million year over year decrease in margin at MGU related to an adjustment in the third quarter of 2008 for recovery of prior natural gas costs in a MPSC proceeding. The decrease in margin was partially offset by the approximate $29 million net positive year over year impact of rate orders and impacts of rate design changes at the regulated natural gas utilities. Operating Income (Loss) Operating results at the regulated natural gas utility segment decreased $306.8 million, from operating income of $192.2 million in 2008, to an operating loss of $114.6 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by a year over year increase in non cash goodwill impairment losses of $284.6 million and the $22.7 million decrease in natural gas margin, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in other operating expenses. See Note 10, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for information related to the goodwill impairment losses recorded in 2009 and 2008. The year over year decrease in other operating expenses primarily related to: An approximate $20 million net decrease in amortization of the regulatory asset related to environmental cleanup expenditures of manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by an increase in EEP expenses. Both of these costs were recovered from customers in rates. A $17.7 million decrease in bad debt expense driven by the impact lower energy prices had on overall accounts receivable balances and the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at PGL, NSG, and MGU. PGL and NSG elected during the third quarter of 2009, under a new Illinois state law, to file for recovery from or refund to customers the difference between actual bad debt expense reported as a component of earnings and the bad debt expense included in utility rates retroactive to January 1, 2008. Bad debt expense also decreased as a result of MGUs rate order effective January 1, 2010, which established a bad debt expense tracking mechanism that allows for the deferral and subsequent recovery or refund of 80% of the difference between actual bad debt write offs (net of recoveries) and bad debt expense included in utility rates. The bad debt mechanism allowed recovery of a portion of the December 31, 2009 accounts receivable reserve representing future bad debt write offs. The decrease in bad debt expense attributed to the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at the natural gas utilities was $9.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by: 35 A $13.4 million increase in employee benefit costs, partially related to an increase in pension expense resulting from negative pension investment returns in 2008, as well as higher health care related expenses in 2009. Restructuring expenses of $6.9 million related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for more information. A $5.5 million increase in natural gas maintenance costs, primarily related to increased system inspection and maintenance requirements. A $5.0 million increase in expenses related to workers compensation claims. A $3.0 million charge related to an expected settlement at PGL and NSG. A $2.5 million increase in amortization of a regulatory asset related to conservation program initiatives. 2008 Compared with 2007 Revenues Regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased $922.2 million, driven by: A combined increase in PGL and NSG natural gas utility revenue of $780.5 million, from $1,118.5 million during 2007, to $1,899.0 million during 2008. The increase in revenue at both of these natural gas utilities was driven primarily by the fact that they were not included in regulated natural gas utility results until after the PEC merger on February 21, 2007. Other factors that contributed to this combined increase include: PGLs annualized rate increase effective February 14, 2008, which increased revenue year over year by approximately $61 million. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on the PGL and NSG rate cases. Higher year over year natural gas prices. Increases in natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in rates. Colder weather during the 2008 heating season, partially offset by energy conservation efforts by natural gas utility customers and a larger number of customer disconnections, which Integrys Energy Group believes resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy. An increase in natural gas revenue of $141.7 million at the remaining natural gas utilities (WPS, MERC, and MGU) from $985.1 million during 2007, to $1,126.8 million during 2008, which resulted primarily from: A combined $112.2 million increase in revenue driven by the approximate 13% increase in the per unit cost of natural gas in 2008 compared with 2007. A $43.4 million increase in revenue from colder weather during the 2008 heating season compared with 2007, evidenced by an approximate 11% year over year increase in heating degree days across these three utilities. An increase in revenue from MERCs interim rate increase, effective October 1, 2008, for retail natural gas customers. 36 The combined increase in revenue at WPS, MGU, and MERC, was partially offset by a $17.9 million decrease in revenue driven by a decrease in year over year volumes normalized for the impact of weather, $15.6 million of which was driven by a 39.3% decrease in natural gas throughput volumes sold by WPS to its electric utility segment. The decrease in volumes sold to the electric utility segment was a result of a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units during the 2008 summer cooling season because of cooler year over year weather. Additional electricity was also available within the electric utility segment from Weston 4, a coal fired generating facility that became commercially operational in June 2008. The remaining decrease in weather normalized volumes was driven by energy conservation efforts of residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year, which Integrys Energy Group believes resulted from high energy prices and a general slowdown in the economy. Margins Regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased $228.0 million, primarily due to: An increase in the combined margin at PGL and NSG of $208.6 million, from $387.2 million in 2007 to $595.8 million in 2008. The increase in combined margin was driven by: The acquisition of PGL and NSG on February 21, 2007. The combined operations for the entire heating season were included in the 2008 natural gas utility margin. However, only operations from the merger date through December 31, 2007, were included in the 2007 natural gas utility margin. Due to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities, higher margins are generally derived during the heating season (first and fourth quarters). The 2008 rate increase for PGL which resulted in an approximate $61 million increase in margin. Colder than normal weather experienced by both PGL and NSG resulted in an approximate $7 million increase in 2008 margin before the decoupling mechanism went into effect on March 1, 2008. An increase in natural gas margin of $19.4 million at the remaining natural gas utilities (WPS, MERC, and MGU), primarily driven by: A combined 5.2% increase in natural gas throughput volumes at WPS, MERC, and MGU, which had an approximate $11 million positive impact on natural gas utility margins. Colder year over year weather had an approximate $14 million positive impact on margins. Partially offsetting the positive impact of colder weather, were energy conservation efforts by residential customers and a larger number of customer disconnections year over year, which had an approximate $3 million negative impact on margins. The interim rate increase for MERC, effective October 1, 2008, which had a positive impact on natural gas margin. An approximate $2 million year over year increase in margin at MGU related to an adjustment for recovery of prior natural gas costs in an MPSC proceeding. 37 Operating Income Operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased $100.2 million, driven by the $228.0 million increase in the natural gas utility margin, partially offset by a $127.8 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily related to an increase in combined operating expenses at PGL and NSG of $125.8 million, from $368.7 million for 2007 to $494.5 million for 2008. The increase in operating expenses related to PGL and NSG was primarily driven by: The acquisition of these natural gas utilities on February 21, 2007. As a result, operating expenses for the period January 1, 2007 to the acquisition date were not included in the 2007 operating results. A non cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.5 million recognized in the second quarter of 2008 related to NSG. A combined increase in bad debt expense, driven by the impact of high energy prices and worsening economic conditions on overall accounts receivable balances. Other Expense Other expense at the regulated natural gas utilities increased $1.7 million, driven by a $3.2 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in miscellaneous income. The increase in other expense was a result of: A $6.1 million increase in combined interest expense at PGL and NSG, from $30.3 million in 2007 to $36.4 million in 2008. The increase in interest expense at PGL and NSG is primarily due to the fact that these utilities were first acquired on February 21, 2007, and, therefore, did not recognize a full year of interest expense in 2007. The increase in interest expense was also due to additional long term debt borrowings and higher interest rates on new and remarketed long term debt. The increase in other expense was offset by: A $2.6 million increase in AFUDC at WPS related to the construction of natural gas laterals for connection to the Guardian II pipeline. A decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in short term borrowing levels and a decrease in interest rates for WPSs natural gas segment. 38 Regulated Electric Utility Segment Operations Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Change in 2009 Over 2008 Change in 2008 Over 2007 Revenues $ 1,301.6 $ 1,328.9 $ 1,246.1 (2.1 )% 6.6 % Fuel and purchased power costs 584.5 651.5 636.5 (10.3 )% 2.4 % Margins 717.1 677.4 609.6 5.9 % 11.1 % Operating and maintenance expense 392.0 375.3 321.1 4.4 % 16.9 % Restructuring expense 8.6 N/A N/A Depreciation and amortization expense 90.3 84.3 80.1 7.1 % 5.2 % Taxes other than income taxes 46.6 44.3 43.2 5.2 % 2.5 % Operating income 179.6 173.5 165.2 3.5 % 5.0 % Miscellaneous income 4.8 6.0 8.3 (20.0 )% (27.7 )% Interest expense (41.6 ) (36.7 ) (32.4 ) 13.4 % 13.3 % Other expense (36.8 ) (30.7 ) (24.1 ) 19.9 % 27.4 % Income before taxes $ 142.8 $ 142.8 $ 141.1 % 1.2 % Sales in kilowatt hours Residential 3,043.0 3,064.5 3,173.6 (0.7 )% (3.4 )% Commercial and industrial 8,155.5 8,632.8 8,750.9 (5.5 )% (1.3 )% Wholesale 5,079.1 4,764.6 4,024.9 6.6 % 18.4 % Other 40.0 42.6 42.4 (6.1 )% 0.5 % Total sales in kilowatt hours 16,317.6 16,504.5 15,991.8 (1.1 )% 3.2 % Weather WPS: Heating degree days 7,962 7,969 7,102 (0.1 )% 12.2 % Cooling degree days 274 464 634 (40.9 )% (26.8 )% Weather UPPCO: Heating degree days 9,317 9,348 8,625 (0.3 )% 8.4 % Cooling degree days 99 138 352 (28.3 )% (60.8 )% 2009 Compared with 2008 Revenues Regulated electric utility segment revenues decreased $27.3 million, driven by: A 5.5% decrease in commercial and industrial sales volumes and a 0.7% decrease in residential sales volumes, which resulted in an approximate $23 million year over year decrease in revenue, after the impact of decoupling. The primary drivers of the decrease were: An approximate $31 million year over year decrease due to lower demand related to changes in commercial and industrial customers plant operations, which Integrys Energy Group attributed mainly to the general economic slowdown. An approximate $6 million decrease primarily related to cooler year over year weather during the cooling season as evidenced by the decrease in cooling degree days at both WPS and UPPCO. 39 These decreases in volumes were partially offset by the $14.0 million impact that decoupling, which went into effect on January 1, 2009, had on WPSs revenue. Under decoupling, WPS is allowed to defer the difference between its actual margin and the rate case authorized margin recognized from residential and small commercial and industrial customers. This four year pilot program for electric decoupling has an annual $14.0 million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin. This cap was reached during the second quarter of 2009; therefore, no additional decoupling deferral was allowed for additional shortfalls from authorized margin for the second half of the year. An approximate $22 million year over year reduction in revenue related to refunds due to customers in both 2009 and 2008 related to WPSs over collection of fuel costs. On April 23, 2009, the PSCW made 2009 fuel cost recovery subject to refund, effective April 25, 2009, as actual and projected fuel costs for the remainder of the year were estimated to be below the 2% fuel window. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on WPSs fuel window. An approximate $14 million year over year decrease in opportunity sales driven by lower demand and the availability of lower cost power from the MISO market. These decreases in regulated electric utility segment revenue were partially offset by: An approximate $19 million increase driven by higher wholesale volumes due to an increase in contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer and an increase in the wholesale demand rate, effective January 1, 2009, to recover costs related to Weston 4. An approximate $15 million increase in revenue from the combined effect of the July 4, 2008 fuel surcharge, a portion of which was incorporated into WPSs 2009 non fuel base retail electric rates, and the full years benefit of the 2008 retail electric rate increase, effective January 16, 2008, for WPS. Margins The regulated electric utility segment margin increased $39.7 million, driven by: An approximate $20 million year over year increase in margin from wholesale customers related to increases in contracted sales volumes with an existing customer and an increase in the wholesale demand rate, effective January 1, 2009, to recover costs related to Weston 4. An approximate $14 million year over year increase in margin from the combined effect of the July 4, 2008 fuel surcharge, a portion of which was incorporated into WPSs 2009 non fuel base retail electric rates, and the full years benefit of the 2008 retail electric rate increase, effective January 16, 2008, for WPS. An approximate $11 million year over year increase in WPSs regulated electric utility margin due to fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $12 million lower than what was recovered in rates during 2009, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $1 million lower than what was recovered in rates during 2008. The increase in margin was partially offset by an approximate $4 million year over year decrease in margin, after the impact of the WPS decoupling mechanism, caused by a 4.3% year over year decrease in sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers. The $14.0 million impact of decoupling partially offset the approximate $18 million decrease in margin due to lower sales volumes, which was attributed to the general economic slowdown and cooler year over year weather during the cooling season. 40 Operating Income Operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased $6.1 million, driven by the $39.7 million increase in margin, partially offset by a $33.6 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was driven by: $8.6 million in restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for more information. An $8.2 million increase in electric maintenance expenses at WPS, primarily related to a greater number of planned outages at the generation plants during 2009, compared with 2008. An $8.1 million increase in employee benefit costs, primarily related to an increase in pension expense driven partially by negative pension investment returns in 2008, as well as higher health care related expenses in 2009. A $5.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense at WPS, primarily related to Weston 4 being placed in service for accounting purposes in April 2008. Other Expense Other expense at the regulated electric utilities increased $6.1 million, driven by: A $4.9 million increase in interest expense, primarily related to increased long term borrowings at WPS in December 2008. The additional borrowings were utilized to fund various construction projects, most notably the Crane Creek wind generation project in Iowa. A $2.5 million decrease in interest earned on the transmission facilities WPS funded on ATCs behalf. WPS was reimbursed by ATC for these transmission facilities in April 2008. 2008 Compared with 2007 Revenues Regulated electric utility segment revenue increased $82.8 million, driven by: A 3.2% increase in electric sales volumes, which resulted in an approximate $26 million increase in revenue year over year, related to: An 18.4% increase in wholesale volumes year over year, which drove an approximate $48 million increase in revenue. There was an approximate $36 million increase in opportunity sales year over year as the electric utility had more low cost generation with Weston 4 becoming commercially operational in 2008, combined with available capacity from lower sales volumes to residential customers. In addition, WPS experienced an approximate $12 million increase in wholesale revenue, driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year. 41 The increase in revenue related to wholesale volumes was partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in residential sales volumes and a 1.3% decrease in commercial and industrial sales volumes year over year, which drove an approximate $22 million decrease in revenue. Of this decrease in revenue, approximately $13 million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers, which is believed to be the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown. Approximately $6 million related to decreased demand by commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as the economy weakened. In addition, cooler weather during the 2008 cooling season compared with 2007 contributed approximately $3 million to the decrease in revenue. An interim fuel surcharge approved by the PSCW for WPSs retail electric customers effective March 22, 2008, related to higher fuel and purchased power costs. In addition, a surcharge increase was approved by the PSCW effective July 4, 2008. Both orders combined had an overall impact on revenue of approximately $25 million. Contributing factors in this rate change were increased purchased power costs due to lower than expected generation from the new Weston 4 power plant during the start up phases, increased coal and coal transportation costs, and increased natural gas costs. On September 30, 2008, the PSCW reopened the 2008 fuel surcharge to review forecasted fuel costs as WPSs current and anticipated annual fuel costs were below those projected in the fuel surcharge. As a result of these lower costs, WPS accrued at December 31, 2008, a refund payable in 2009 to its electric customers of approximately $5 million, which is excluded from the $25 million noted above. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on WPSs interim fuel surcharges. A retail electric rate increase, effective January 16, 2008, which contributed an approximate $23 million increase in revenue. The full benefit of the 2007 retail electric rate increase, effective January 12, 2007, also contributed to the increase in revenue year over year. Per the PSCWs order approving the PEC merger, WPS was not permitted to increase its base rates for natural gas or electric service prior to January 1, 2009. However, WPS was allowed to adjust rates for changes in purchased power costs as well as fuel costs related to electric generation due to changes in NYMEX natural gas futures prices, delivered coal prices, and transmission costs. The increase also included recovery of deferred 2005 and 2006 MISO Day 2 costs over a one year period. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on WPSs rate increase. An approximate $5 million increase in revenue at UPPCO related to increased energy and transmission costs in 2008 compared with 2007. Increases in fuel and purchased power costs at UPPCO are passed directly through to customers in rates. Margins The regulated electric utility segment margin increased $67.8 million, driven by an increase in electric margin at WPS. The $68.4 million increase in the electric margin at WPS was a result of: A $54.0 million partial refund to Wisconsin retail customers in 2007 for their portion of proceeds from the liquidation of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, the decrease in the 2007 margin related to the refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expense in 2007 and, therefore, did not have an impact on earnings. WPS completed this refund in 2007. An approximate $10 million increase in margin from the 2008 retail electric rate increase effective January 16, 2008, and the full benefit of the 2007 retail electric rate increase effective January 12, 2007. An approximate $10 million increase in margin driven by higher contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer year over year. 42 An approximate $5 million increase in regulated electric utility margin year over year driven by fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $1 million lower than what was recovered in rates during 2008, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $4 million higher than what was recovered in rates during 2007. As a result of approximately $23 million of under recovered fuel and purchased power costs in the first quarter of 2008, the PSCW approved an interim rate surcharge effective March 22, 2008, and subsequently approved a higher final surcharge effective July 4, 2008. The $5 million increase in electric margin includes lower fuel costs from the fuel window reset and the net impact of the refund accrued at December 31, 2008, payable in 2009 to electric customers from the reopening of the 2008 fuel surcharge on September 30, 2008, by the PSCW. These increases in the electric margin were partially offset by an approximate $11 million decrease in margin due to a decline in residential and commercial and industrial sales volumes. Of this decrease, approximately $8 million related to energy conservation efforts on the part of residential customers, which is believed to be the result of high energy prices and the general economic slowdown. Approximately $1 million related to decreased demand by commercial and industrial customers in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as the economy worsened. In addition, cooler weather during the 2008 cooling season compared with 2007 contributed approximately $2 million to the decrease in gross margin. Operating Income Operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased $8.3 million, driven by the $67.8 million increase in the electric utility margin, partially offset by a $59.5 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was driven by: A $54.0 million year over year increase related to the partial amortization in 2007 of the regulatory liability previously recorded for WPSs obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the Kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to Wisconsin retail electric ratepayers. A $13.8 million increase in electric transmission expenses, primarily related to higher rates charged by MISO and ATC due to additional transmission costs. A $6.1 million increase in cost of capital and depreciation expense charged by IBS for assets transferred from WPS to IBS in the beginning of 2008 and reported as operating and maintenance expense in 2008. Similar costs were reported as depreciation and amortization expense in 2007, prior to the start up of IBS. A $4.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to $9.2 million of depreciation expense from Weston 4 being placed in service for accounting purposes in April 2008, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation related to assets transferred to IBS and reported in operating and maintenance expense in 2008. 43 These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by: An $11.6 million decrease in electric maintenance expenses at WPS, primarily due to major planned outages at the Weston 2 and Weston 3 generation stations, the De Pere Energy Center, and the Pulliam generation station, as well as several unplanned outages at the Weston 3 generation station in 2007, compared with fewer outages in 2008. A decrease in external costs to achieve merger synergies of $6.6 million related to the merger with PEC, from $12.3 million in 2007, to $5.7 million in 2008. This decrease occurred primarily because all external costs to achieve merger synergies incurred from July 2006 through March 2007 were reallocated in 2007 from the holding company segment to the other reportable segments, including the regulated electric segment. These reportable segments are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve merger synergies. In addition, the reduction in 2008 external costs to achieve merger synergies was due to less integration work required in 2008 compared with 2007. Other Expense Other expense at the regulated electric utilities increased $6.6 million, driven by a $4.3 million increase in interest expense and a $2.3 million decrease in miscellaneous income. The increase in interest expense was due to higher long term borrowings at WPS, primarily utilized to fund various construction projects and to retire short term borrowing levels related to construction. The decrease in miscellaneous income was driven by: A $1.4 million decrease in interest income recognized related to the construction of transmission facilities WPS funded on ATCs behalf related to Weston 4. WPS was reimbursed for these transmission facilities by ATC in April 2008. A $1.8 million gain on the sale of a generation facility by UPPCO in July 2007. The decrease in miscellaneous income was partially offset by an increase in AFUDC related to the wind generation project. Integrys Energy Services Operations Integrys Energy Services is a diversified nonregulated energy supply and services company serving residential, commercial, and industrial customers.

Lower sales volumes, as wholesale transactions were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of 2008, and continue to be scaled back with Integrys Energy Services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas and electric businesses. See "Introduction" above and Note 4, "Dispositions," for a discussion of the current strategy for Integrys Energy Services. Margins Changes in commodity prices subject a portion of the nonregulated operations to earnings volatility, driven primarily by its wholesale trading and marketing operations. Integrys Energy Services uses financial instruments to economically hedge risks associated with physical transactions. The financial instruments essentially lock in margin on these transactions by mitigating the impact of fluctuations in 45 market conditions, changing commodity prices, volumetric exposure, and other associated risks. Because many of the derivative instruments utilized in these transactions may not qualify, or are not designated, as hedges under GAAP, reported earnings for the Integrys Energy Services segment includes changes in the fair values of many of the derivative instruments. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as unrealized gains or losses within margin. Fluctuations in the fair value of the nonderivative instruments (such as certain customer contracts, as well as natural gas storage and transportation contracts) do not impact margin until settlement, as these transactions do not meet the GAAP definition of derivative instruments. Integrys Energy Services margins increased $212.2 million in 2009, compared with 2008. The significant items contributing to the change in margin were as follows: Electric and Other Margins Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins increased $205.8 million during 2009, compared with 2008. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins. Realized wholesale electric margin Realized wholesale electric margin increased $18.8 million, from $59.4 million during 2008, to $78.2 million during 2009. Wholesale transactions and structured origination activity were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of 2008 and continue to be scaled back with Integrys Energy Services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale electric business. See "Introduction" above and Note 4, "Dispositions," for a discussion of the current strategy for Integrys Energy Services. In general, realized margins are impacted by transaction activity in prior periods, as Integrys Energy Services recognizes realized margin when the contracts actually settle, which typically occurs over a 12 to 24 month period from the time the contract was actually entered into. In 2009, realized margins benefited from the settlement of contracts that were entered into prior to the implementation of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Realized retail electric margin The realized retail electric margin increased $19.7 million, from $62.3 million in 2008, to $82.0 million in 2009. The increase was driven by: A $14.1 million increase in the more mature markets, such as Illinois and New York, as Integrys Energy Services realized the benefits of including higher capital costs in its pricing in the first half of the year. A $6.5 million increase from operations in the Texas market. This increase is a result of the positive year over year impact of lower ancillary service costs compared to the prior year and the effects of Hurricane Ike in the third quarter of 2008. Hurricane Ike disrupted the electric infrastructure in Texas for a period of time, causing some of Integrys Energy Services customers to be without electricity or buy only a fraction of their normal energy usage during that period. Retail and wholesale electric fair value adjustments Integrys Energy Services margin from retail and wholesale electric fair value adjustments increased $167.3 million, as it recognized $137.4 million of non cash unrealized losses related to derivative instruments in 2008, compared with $29.9 million of non cash unrealized gains during 2009. 46 The non cash unrealized gains and losses resulted from the application of GAAP derivative accounting rules to Integrys Energy Services portfolio of electric customer supply contracts, requiring that these derivative instruments be adjusted to fair market value. The fair value adjustments recorded in 2009 include margin reductions of $2.0 million related to the settlement of derivative contracts entered into with the purchaser of the Canadian electric power portfolio, as discussed in Note 4, "Dispositions". Natural Gas Margins Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins increased $6.4 million in 2009, compared with 2008. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins. Lower of cost or market inventory adjustments The combined effect of lower of cost or market inventory write downs and withdrawals from storage of natural gas for which write downs had previously been recorded resulted in a $322.7 million year over year increase in the natural gas margin. The average market price of natural gas decreased approximately 5% during 2009 and decreased approximately 22% during 2008, driving a positive year over year change in natural gas margins of $129.2 million related to lower of cost or market inventory write downs. These lower of cost or market inventory write downs were required to reflect natural gas in storage at the end of the period at its net realizable value, as required by GAAP. The natural gas withdrawn from storage and sold to customers in 2009 had a $193.5 million lower cost basis as a result of lower of cost or market inventory write downs recorded in prior periods. At December 31, 2009, natural gas inventory had a lower cost basis as a result of lower of cost or market inventory write downs recorded in prior periods of $11.6 million. Other realized retail natural gas margins Other realized retail natural gas margins increased $17.2 million, from $51.5 million in 2008, to $68.7 million in 2009. The increase was due to Integrys Energy Services withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas during 2009 in order to improve its liquidity position, recognizing realized gains on these natural gas storage withdrawals. Also, per unit retail natural gas margins were higher period over period as more recently contracted sales commitments reflect increased business risk and financing costs in the pricing. Offsetting the increase was a decrease in Integrys Energy Services natural gas sales volumes year over year. Integrys Energy Services significantly reduced the number of natural gas storage transactions entered into as Integrys Energy Group implemented its strategy change for its nonregulated energy services business segment. Other realized wholesale natural gas margins Other realized wholesale natural gas margins decreased $23.3 million, from $64.1 million in 2008, to $40.8 million in 2009. In conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of 2008, wholesale natural gas transactions were scaled back and continue to be scaled back with Integrys Energy Services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas business. The reduced activity had a negative impact on realized margins in 2009. See "Introduction" above, and Note 4, "Dispositions," for a discussion of the current strategy for Integrys Energy Services. Fair value adjustments Fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily related to changes in the fair market value of contracts utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with certain natural gas storage contracts, as well as basis swaps utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with natural gas transportation contracts and certain natural gas sales contracts. The fair value adjustments (excluding lower of cost or market inventory adjustments) drove a $310.2 million decrease in natural gas margins as unrealized losses on these instruments were 47 $157.1 million during 2009, compared with unrealized gains of $153.1 million during 2008. The fair value adjustments recorded in 2009 include a net increase in margin of $14.4 million related to the settlement of derivative contracts entered into with the purchasers of the wholesale natural gas marketing business and the Canadian natural gas portfolio, as discussed in Note 4, "Dispositions". Operating Income (Loss) Integrys Energy Services operating income increased $142.6 million year over year. This increase resulted from the $212.2 million increase in margin discussed above, partially offset by losses of $28.9 million related to dispositions completed in connection with the strategy change; $27.2 million of restructuring expenses, which included employee related costs, the write off of capitalized development costs related to software that will not be utilized because of the restructuring, and consulting and legal fees; a $9.1 million increase in operating and maintenance expense; and a $4.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to renewable energy asset additions. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by a one time $9.0 million novation fee related to an agreement with a counterparty that enabled Integrys Energy Services to consolidate certain wholesale financial and physical contracts that were previously entered into with multiple counterparties, allowing Integrys Energy Services to reduce collateral support requirements. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for a discussion of restructuring charges. 2008 Compared with 2007 Revenues Revenues increased $2,755.5 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to increased volumes (in part due to the PEC merger in 2007) and higher average sales prices in 2008. Average sales prices rose in 2008 due to large market price increases from January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008. Market prices began to decline beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and continued to decline through the end of the year to levels below that of January 1, 2008. Integrys Energy Services recognizes revenue at the time energy is delivered. As a result, revenues at the end of the year were recognized based on the higher market prices from contracts entered into earlier in the year. Margins Integrys Energy Services margin decreased $218.4 million from 2007 to 2008. The significant items contributing to the change in margin were as follows: Electric and Other Margins Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins decreased $180.6 million from 2007 to 2008. The 2008 and 2007 electric and other margin included the negative impact of $8.8 million and $15.2 million, respectively, of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the PEC merger. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services electric and other margins. Realized gains on structured origination contracts Realized gains on structured origination transactions increased $6.2 million, from $18.1 million in 2007 to $24.3 million in 2008. Origination transactions are physical, customer based agreements with municipalities, merchant generators, cooperatives, and regulated utilities. The increase was primarily due to growth in existing markets with an emphasis on structured transactions with small environmentally friendly generators. 48 All other realized wholesale electric margin All other realized wholesale electric margin decreased $19.4 million from 2007 to 2008. In general, realized margins are impacted by trading activity in prior periods. Integrys Energy Services recognizes realized margins when the contracts actually settle, which can lag as much as 12 to 24 months from the time the contract was actually entered into. The reduced volume of proprietary trading that began in 2007 reduced realized margins in 2008. Realized retail electric margin The realized retail electric margin increased $28.1 million from $34.2 million in 2007 to $62.3 million in 2008. The change was primarily due to the following: An increase of $19.5 million from operations in Illinois due to the addition of new customers as a result of the PEC merger, as well as a reduced impact from purchase accounting in 2008. A $12.7 million increase due to expansion in the Mid Atlantic region and the resolution of certain regulatory issues in Northern Maine. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.4 million decrease from operations in Texas. This reduction was a result of higher ancillary costs in Texas and the effects of Hurricane Ike, which disrupted the electric infrastructure in Texas for a period of time, causing some of Integrys Energy Services customers to be without electricity or take only a fraction of their normal load during that period. Retail and wholesale fair value adjustments From 2007 to 2008, Integrys Energy Services margin from electric retail and wholesale fair value adjustments decreased $176.8 million, as it recognized $137.4 million of non cash unrealized losses related to derivative instruments in 2008, compared with $39.4 million of non cash unrealized gains during 2007. Although energy prices rose approximately 20% in the first half of 2008, they declined approximately 45% in the second half of the year, which led to the recognition of large non cash unrealized losses in 2008 on these electric customer supply contracts. These unrealized losses turn around in future years as the contracts settle. The mark to market activity also reflects increases in portfolio reserves in recognition of the increased risk of credit losses and reduced market liquidity. Finally, the mark to market activity was also negatively impacted as the short term cost of borrowing increased. The discount rate is a component of the fair value of Integrys Energy Services derivative portfolio and, therefore, increased interest rates resulted in a reduction in the fair value presented on the balance sheet. In 2007, energy prices increased, resulting in unrealized gains. Oil option activity Oil option activity drove a $19.6 million decrease in electric and other margins from 2007 to 2008. There was no activity related to these oil options in 2008. Prior to 2008, oil options were utilized to protect the value of a portion of Integrys Energy Services Section 29/45K federal tax credits. However, companies can no longer generate tax credits from the production of synthetic fuel as the provisions of Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code expired effective December 31, 2007. As a result, Integrys Energy Services exercised substantially all of its remaining oil options in 2007. 2005 liquidation of electric supply contract In the fourth quarter of 2005, an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in Maine requested that Integrys Energy Services liquidate a firm contract to buy power in 2006 and 2007. At that time, Integrys Energy Services recognized an $8.2 million gain related to the liquidation of the contract and entered into 49 a new contract with another supplier for firm power in 2006 and 2007 to supply its customers in Maine. The cost to purchase power under the new contract was more than the cost under the liquidated contract. The replacement contract increased the cost of purchased power needed to serve customers in Maine by $0.9 million in 2007. There was no impact on electric margin in 2008, resulting in a $0.9 million increase in realized wholesale electric margins from 2007 to 2008. Natural Gas Margins Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins decreased $37.8 million from 2007 to 2008. The 2008 and 2007 natural gas margins included the negative impact of $5.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively, of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the PEC merger. The following items were the most significant contributors to the change in Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins. Lower of cost or market inventory adjustments The spot price of natural gas decreased significantly during the second half of 2008 (below the average cost of natural gas in inventory which Integrys Energy Services had acquired and injected earlier in 2008), which resulted in a lower of cost or market inventory write down, as required by GAAP. This write down resulted in a $160.3 million decrease in non cash realized natural gas margins from 2007 to 2008. The negative impact on realized margin related to these inventory write downs was offset by unrealized gains recognized in 2008 and 2007 on derivative instruments utilized to mitigate the price risk on natural gas inventory underlying natural gas storage transactions (See "Fair value adjustments" below). Other realized natural gas margins Other realized natural gas margins increased $8.0 million, from $107.6 million in 2007, to $115.6 million in 2008, primarily related to realized gains on wholesale natural gas storage transactions. In 2008, Integrys Energy Services increased its storage withdrawals which drove the year over year increase in other realized natural gas margins. In addition, Integrys Energy Services placed greater emphasis on structured wholesale natural gas transactions in 2008 in existing markets, which also contributed to the increase. These structured transactions involve serving customers such as regulated utilities, pipelines, retail marketers, and other large end users of natural gas. Spot to forward differential Integrys Energy Services experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle, which runs annually from April through March of the next year. Generally, injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months. Integrys Energy Services policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with contracts in the over the counter and futures markets, effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage. However, hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices, while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices. When the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas, Integrys Energy Services experiences volatility in its earnings. Consequently, earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage. The accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions. The natural gas storage cycle had a positive $5.5 million impact on natural gas margins from 2007 to 2008. There was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in 2007 compared with a $5.5 million positive impact in 2008. At December 31, 2008, the market value of natural gas in storage was not significantly different than the market value of future sales contracts related to the 2008/2009 natural gas storage cycle. 50 Fair value adjustments In 2008, fair value adjustments drove a $109.0 million increase in the natural gas margins as unrealized gains on these instruments were $147.6 million in 2008, compared with unrealized gains of $38.6 million in 2007. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income at Integrys Energy Services decreased $241.5 million year over year. This decrease resulted primarily from the $218.4 million decrease in margin discussed above. In addition, operating and maintenance expense increased $22.3 million, driven largely by a $9.1 million increase in bad debt expense, $7.3 million of which resulted from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the third quarter of 2008; a $5.1 million increase in broker commissions as a result of higher transaction volumes; and higher employee benefit costs. Other Expense Other expense at Integrys Energy Services decreased $10.4 million year over year. This decrease resulted primarily from an increase in miscellaneous income of $9.0 million, driven by a $13.8 million decrease in pre tax net losses related to Integrys Energy Services former investment in a synthetic fuel facility. This increase in miscellaneous income was partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in foreign currency gains related to Integrys Energy Services Canadian subsidiaries and a $3.7 million decrease in interest and dividend income on margin deposits. Electric Transmission Investment Segment Operations 2009 Compared with 2008 Other Income Other income at the electric transmission investment segment increased $9.2 million during 2009 compared with 2008, due to an increase in income from Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. The increase in income was driven by ATCs continuing capital expenditure program, resulting in an increase in its rate base. 2008 Compared with 2007 Other Income Other income at the electric transmission investment segment increased $15.6 million during 2008 compared with 2007, due to an increase in income from Integrys Energy Groups ownership interest in ATC. The increase in income was driven by ATCs continuing capital expenditure program, resulting in an increase in its rate base. Holding Company and Other Segment Operations Change in Change in Year Ended December 31 2009 Over 2008 Over (Millions) 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 Operating loss $ (1.9 ) $ (0.7 ) $ (11.8 ) 171.4 % (94.1 )% Other expense (58.1 ) (53.2 ) (62.8 ) 9.2 % (15.3 )% Loss before taxes $ (60.0 ) $ (53.9 ) $ (74.6 ) 11.3 % (27.7 )% 51 2009 Compared with 2008 Operating Loss Operating loss at the holding company and other segment increased $1.2 million during 2009 compared with 2008, driven by restructuring expenses related to Integrys Energy Groups reduction in workforce, and by a decrease in operating income from MERCs nonutility home services business. Other Expense Other expense at the holding company and other segment increased $4.9 million during 2009 compared with 2008, driven by a $4.3 million increase in interest expense at the holding company primarily due to an increase in long term borrowings in the second quarter of 2009 and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing fees related to credit facilities entered into in the second quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on commercial paper. 2008 Compared with 2007 Operating Loss Operating loss at the holding company and other segment improved $11.1 million during 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease in the operating loss was driven by: Reductions in operating expenses related to consulting fees, compensation and benefits, and contractor costs at the holding company. Operating income of $1.9 million generated at IBS, which related to return on capital included in its service charges beginning in 2008. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating loss, was a $6.5 million increase in the year over year operating loss related to external costs to achieve merger synergies associated with the PEC merger. This increase occurred primarily because in March 2007 all external costs to achieve merger synergies incurred from July 2006 through March 2007 were allocated from the Holding Company and Other segment (where they were initially recorded) to the other reportable segments, which are the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from these costs. This resulted in lower operating expenses at the Holding Company and Other segment during 2007. Other Income (Expense) Other income increased $9.6 million, driven by a $10.5 million decrease in external interest expense due to lower interest rates and lower average short term borrowings used for working capital requirements at Integrys Energy Group. A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of PEP in September 2007 was used to pay down the short term debt. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Effective Tax Rate 717.2 % 29.1 % 32.2 % 52 2009 Compared with 2008 The increase in the effective tax rate for 2009 was primarily related to the tax treatment of Integrys Energy Groups $291.1 million non cash pre tax goodwill impairment loss. Although Integrys Energy Group had $11.6 million of income before taxes for 2009, it recorded an $83.2 million provision for income taxes because $186.2 million of the total pre tax goodwill impairment loss was not deductible for income tax purposes. 2008 Compared with 2007 The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2008 was primarily driven by the impact of large permanent tax deductions pertaining to items that exceeded the related book expense being applied to the lower income before taxes in 2008, compared with 2007. In addition, in 2008 Integrys Energy Group recognized $10.0 million of investment tax credits related to solar projects completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. These were offset by the reduction in Section 29/45K tax credits in 2008 due to the December 31, 2007, expiration of Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code that made tax credits available from the production and sale of synthetic fuel. In 2007, Integrys Energy Groups ownership in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in recognizing the tax benefit of Section 29/45K federal tax credits of $13.6 million compared with $0.8 million of Section 29/45K tax credits recognized in 2008. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 2009 Compared with 2008 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $1.9 million in 2009 compared with 2008. During 2009, Integrys Energy Services completed the sale of its energy management consulting business. The historical financial results of this business were not significant. The gain on the sale of this business recorded in discontinued operations during the third quarter of 2009 was $3.9 million ($2.4 million after tax). During 2008, Integrys Energy Services recognized a $6.3 million ($3.8 million after tax) gain on the sale of its subsidiary, Mid American Power, LLC, in discontinued operations when a previously contingent payment was paid by the buyer. For more information on the discontinued operations discussed above, see Note 4, "Dispositions," and Note 25, "Segments of Business." 2008 Compared with 2007 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $68.6 million in 2008, compared with 2007. During 2008, Integrys Energy Services sold its subsidiary Mid American Power, LLC, which owned the Stoneman generation facility, located in Wisconsin. The historical financial results of this business were not significant. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Integrys Energy Services recognized a $6.3 million ($3.8 million after tax) gain on the sale of this business in discontinued operations when a previously contingent payment was earned and paid by the buyer. This contingent payment resulted from legislation that passed in the fourth quarter of 2008, which extended the production tax credits available for certain biomass facilities. During 2007, Integrys Energy Group recognized $58.5 million of income from discontinued operations related to the sale of PEP, which included an after tax gain of $7.6 million on the sale. In 2008, discontinued operations reflect the $0.8 million positive impact of tax adjustments related to the 2007 PEP sale. During 2007, WPS Niagara Generation, LLC recognized after tax income of $14.8 million from discontinued operations, primarily related to the $14.7 million after tax gain on the sale of this business. 53 BALANCE SHEET Cash and cash equivalents decreased $209.6 million, from $254.1 million at December 31, 2008, to $44.5 million at December 31, 2009. For a detailed explanation of the change in the cash and cash equivalents balance, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues decreased $934.6 million (49.4%) from $1,892.6 million at December 31, 2008, to $958.0 million at December 31, 2009. The decrease was driven by a reduction in Integrys Energy Services wholesale transactions and natural gas storage transactions as a result of the change in strategy for this business segment. Also contributing to the decrease were lower revenues due to lower natural gas prices and warmer weather during the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with the same period in 2008. Inventories decreased $428.5 million (58.5%), from $732.8 million at December 31, 2008, to $304.3 million at December 31, 2009. The inventory balance at Integrys Energy Services decreased $326.2 million (79.4%), primarily due to lower natural gas prices year over year and the sale of its wholesale natural gas marketing and trading business in December 2009. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for more information. Goodwill decreased $291.4 million (31.2%), from $933.9 million at December 31, 2008, to $642.5 million at December 31, 2009, driven by the impairment loss recorded in the first quarter of 2009 within the natural gas utility segment. Key factors contributing to the impairment charge included disruptions in the global credit and equity markets and the resulting increase in the weighted average cost of capital used to value the natural gas utility operations, as well as the negative impact that the global decline in equity markets had on the valuation of natural gas distribution companies in general. Detailed explanations for changes in the short term and long term debt balances year over year are included in Note 12, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit," and Note 13, "Long Term Debt." Accounts payable decreased $894.9 million (58.3%), from $1,534.3 million at December 31, 2008, to $639.4 million at December 31, 2009. Accounts payable at Integrys Energy Services decreased $813.0 million, primarily due to lower natural gas prices and the reduction in natural gas payables and natural gas loans associated with its wholesale natural gas marketing and trading business. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for more information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Integrys Energy Group believes that its cash balances, liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to equity and debt capital markets, and available borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. Integrys Energy Groups borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies. Integrys Energy Groups operating cash flows and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. The previously announced strategy change at Integrys Energy Services and other operating activities resulted in the generation of a significant amount of positive cash flow from operations during 2009, which drove an approximate $1 billion reduction in consolidated short term debt outstanding during 2009. 54 Operating Cash Flows 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,606.3 million in 2009, compared with net cash used for operating activities of $250.0 million in 2008. The $1,856.3 million year over year increase in cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by a $1,734.8 million increase related to lower working capital requirements, partially due to a $444.1 million decrease in inventories during 2009, compared with a $312.0 million increase in inventories in 2008. This change was primarily a result of an increase in natural gas withdrawn from storage in 2009 due to the previously announced strategy change at Integrys Energy Services, as well as lower year over year natural gas prices. Also contributing to the decrease in working capital requirements was an $864.8 million decrease in accounts receivables and accrued unbilled revenues in 2009, compared with a $207.7 million increase in accounts receivables and accrued unbilled revenues in 2008, primarily the result of lower natural gas prices and the Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Additionally, during 2009, Integrys Energy Services had a $45.5 million net return of margin posted to various exchanges, compared with the net payment of $239.2 million of margin posted to various exchanges in 2008, primarily due to the strategy change. Partially offsetting these changes was a $604.7 million decrease in accounts payable in 2009, compared with a $53.2 million decrease in accounts payable in 2008, primarily the result of lower natural gas prices. 2008 Compared with 2007 Net cash used for operating activities was $250.0 million in 2008, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $238.5 million in 2007. The $488.5 million year over year increase in cash used for operating activities was driven by: A $177.0 million decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable collections, as colder weather conditions led to higher natural gas throughput volumes in the fourth quarter 2008, compared with the same quarter in 2007, contributing to higher accounts receivable balances. Also contributing to the increase in cash used for operating activities, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries, primarily Integrys Energy Services, had net cash collateral payments of $239.2 million in 2008, compared with net cash collateral receipts of $82.0 million in 2007. The net cash collateral payments made in 2008 were driven by large mark to market losses incurred by Integrys Energy Services during the latter part of 2008, due to declining prices. A $139.1 million increase in cash used for natural gas inventory purchases due to an increase in the average price of natural gas during the summer of 2008 (when natural gas is generally injected into inventory), compared with the same period in 2007. Partially offset by an $88.7 million increase in cash related to net refunds of regulatory assets and liabilities, driven by a decrease in the refund to ratepayers in 2008, compared with 2007, of proceeds WPS received from the liquidation of the nonqualified decommissioning trust fund upon the sale of Kewaunee. Investing Cash Flows 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash used for investing activities was $440.7 million in 2009, compared with $452.2 million in 2008. The $11.5 million year over year decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by the $88.6 million decrease in cash used to fund capital expenditures (discussed below) and the payment of $17.4 million in 2008 related to WPSs funding of the construction of the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4, partially offset by the 2008 reimbursement of $99.7 million from ATC related to WPSs construction of the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4. 55 2008 Compared with 2007 Net cash used for investing activities was $452.2 million in 2008, compared with $451.5 million in 2007. The $0.7 million year over year increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by a $140.2 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures (discussed below), partially offset by the reimbursement of $99.7 million from ATC, related to the construction of the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4, and a $15.5 million year over year increase in cash proceeds received from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Reportable Segment (millions) 2009 2008 2007 Electric utility $ 250.4 $ 207.4 $ 202.6 Natural gas utility 136.9 237.3 158.8 Integrys Energy Services 22.4 68.1 20.5 Holding company and other 34.5 20.0 10.7 Integrys Energy Group $ 444.2 $ 532.8 $ 392.6 The increase in capital expenditures at the electric utility segment in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to wind generation projects, partially offset by the year over year decrease in capital expenditures associated with Weston 4. The decrease in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility segment in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in costs related to the construction of natural gas laterals that connected WPSs natural gas distribution system to the Guardian II natural gas pipeline, which was completed in February 2009. The decrease in capital expenditures at Integrys Energy Services in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily driven by fewer expenditures related to renewable energy projects in 2009, compared with 2008. The increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility segment in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures at PGL and NSG due to the fact that they were not acquired until February 21, 2007, as well as construction of the natural gas lateral infrastructure that connects WPSs natural gas distribution system to the Guardian II natural gas pipeline. The increase in capital expenditures at Integrys Energy Services in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to solar energy projects as well as the construction of a pipeline that will transport methane gas produced at a landfill for use at a chemical plant as a replacement for natural gas. Financing Cash Flows 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash used for financing activities was $1,378.4 million in 2009, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $911.3 million in 2008. The $2,289.7 million year over year increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by $973.6 million of net repayments of short term debt and notes payable in 2009, compared with $725.4 million of net short term and notes payable borrowings in 2008. The repayments in 2009 were made possible by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities. Also, as a result of the previously announced strategy change at Integrys Energy Services, fewer structured natural gas loan agreements were entered into in 2009, compared with 2008, resulting in a $368.4 million year over year decrease in proceeds from the sale of borrowed natural gas. Additionally, Integrys Energy Services had a $188.0 million year over year increase in the purchase of natural gas to repay structured natural gas loan agreements, many of which were entered into in 2008. 56 2008 Compared with 2007 Net cash provided by financing activities was $911.3 million in 2008, compared with net cash used for financing activities of $459.2 million in 2007. In 2007, Integrys Energy Group was able to pay down short term debt with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of PEP. In 2008, proceeds were required to fund higher year over year working capital requirements. Significant Financing Activities Dividends paid increased in 2009 compared with 2008. In February 2009, Integrys Energy Group increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 68 cents per share. The quarterly common stock dividend was increased from 66 cents per share to 67 cents per share in 2008. Integrys Energy Group had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $212.1 million and $552.9 million at December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Integrys Energy Group had short term notes payable outstanding of $10.0 million and $181.1 million at December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Integrys Energy Group had no borrowings under revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2009 and $475.0 million as of December 31, 2008. See Note 12, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit" for more information. For information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt at Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries, see Note 13, "Long Term Debt." Prior to January 1, 2008, Integrys Energy Group issued new shares of common stock under its Stock Investment Plan and under certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. As a result of the plans, equity increased $45.6 million in 2007. During 2009 and 2008, shares of Integrys Energy Groups common stock were purchased on the open market to meet the requirements of its Stock Investment Plan and certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. Integrys Energy Group did not repurchase any existing common stock during 2007. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, Integrys Energy Group plans to issue new shares of common stock to meet the requirements of its Stock Investment Plan and certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. Credit Ratings Integrys Energy Group uses internally generated funds, commercial paper borrowings, and other short term borrowings to satisfy most of its capital requirements. Integrys Energy Group also periodically issues long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. Integrys Energy Group, WPS, and PGL have their own commercial paper borrowing programs. WPS periodically issues long term debt and receives equity contributions from Integrys Energy Group to reduce short term debt, fund future growth, and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the PSCW. PGL and NSG periodically issue long term debt in order to reduce short term debt, refinance maturing securities, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. The specific forms of long term financing, amounts, and timing depend on business needs, market conditions, and other factors. 57 The current credit ratings for Integrys Energy Group, WPS, PEC, PGL, and NSG are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys Integrys Energy Group Issuer credit rating Senior unsecured debt Commercial paper Credit facility Junior subordinated notes BBB+ BBB A 2 N/A BBB N/A Baa1 P 2 Baa1 Baa2 WPS Issuer credit rating First mortgage bonds Senior secured debt Preferred stock Commercial paper Credit facility A N/A A BBB A 2 N/A A2 A1 A1 Baa1 P 1 A2 PEC Issuer credit rating Senior unsecured debt BBB+ BBB N/A Baa1 PGL Issuer credit rating Senior secured debt Commercial paper BBB+ A A 2 A3 A2 P 2 NSG Issuer credit rating Senior secured debt BBB+ A A3 A2 Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy or sell securities and are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. On January 26, 2010, Standard and Poors revised the outlook for Integrys Energy Group and all of its subsidiaries to stable from negative. The revised outlook reflected Integrys Energy Groups decision to retain a selected portion of its nonregulated operations, which resulted in a revision to Integrys Energy Groups business risk profile to "strong" from "excellent." The revised outlook also reflected Integrys Energy Groups improved financial measures and decreasing regulatory risk, which resulted in a change in its financial risk profile to "significant" from "aggressive." On June 9, 2009, Moodys assigned an "A3" issuer credit rating to PGL and NSG, and lowered the following ratings of Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries: The senior unsecured debt ratings of Integrys Energy Group and PEC were lowered from "A3" to "Baa1." The credit facility rating of Integrys Energy Group was lowered from "A3" to "Baa1." The junior subordinated notes rating of Integrys Energy Group was lowered from "Baa1" to "Baa2." The issuer credit rating of WPS was lowered from "A1" to "A2." The senior secured debt rating and first mortgage bonds rating of WPS were lowered from "Aa3" to "A1." The senior secured debt ratings of PGL and NSG were lowered from "A1" to "A2." The preferred stock rating of WPS was lowered from "A3" to "Baa1." The credit facility rating of WPS was lowered from "A1" to "A2." The commercial paper rating of PGL was lowered from "P 1" to "P 2." According to Moodys, the downgrade considers managements decision to divest of its nonregulated energy marketing business, and reflects the expected improvements in Integrys Energy Groups business 58 risk and liquidity profiles after the divestiture, as well as the expected challenge of replacing the earnings generated by this nonregulated segment. Also according to Moodys, the downgrade reflects managements decision to leave its dividend policy unchanged despite expected near term reduction in earnings and internal cash flow generation. On March 5, 2009, Standard & Poors lowered the following ratings of Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries: The issuer credit ratings of Integrys Energy Group, PGL, NSG, and PEC were lowered from "A " to "BBB+." The issuer credit rating of WPS was lowered from "A" to "A ." The senior unsecured debt ratings of Integrys Energy Group and PEC were lowered from "BBB+" to "BBB." The junior subordinated notes rating of Integrys Energy Group was lowered from "BBB" to "BBB ." The senior secured debt rating of WPS was lowered from "A+" to "A." The preferred stock rating of WPS was lowered from "BBB+" to "BBB." According to Standard & Poors, Integrys Energy Groups corporate credit downgrade reflects weak financial measures that do not support an "A" category credit profile. Standard & Poors also stated that the downgrade reflects the changes to Integrys Energy Groups business and financial risk profiles. Standard & Poors revised Integrys Energy Groups business risk profile to "excellent" from "strong" and changed its financial risk profile to "aggressive" from "intermediate." The change in the business risk profile reflected the strategy change with respect to Integrys Energy Services and helped to moderate the downgrade. Discontinued Operations 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $3.2 million in 2009 compared with $3.8 million in 2008. 2008 Compared with 2007 Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $3.8 million in 2008 compared with $690.2 million in 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by discontinued operations was driven by the approximate $869.2 million of proceeds received from the sale of PEP. 59 Future Capital Requirements and Resources Contractual Obligations The following table shows the contractual obligations of Integrys Energy Group, including its subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2009. Payments Due By Period (Millions) Total Amounts Committed 2010 2011 to 2012 2013 to 2014 2015 and Thereafter Long term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 3,580.2 $ 254.4 $ 942.3 $ 571.8 $ 1,811.7 Operating lease obligations 68.4 11.6 19.6 13.6 23.6 Commodity purchase obligations (2) 5,735.6 2,399.9 1,858.0 689.8 787.9 Purchase orders (3) 515.3 514.1 1.2 Pension and other postretirement funding obligations (4) 683.4 103.3 267.4 138.1 174.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 10,582.9 $ 3,283.3 $ 3,088.5 $ 1,413.3 $ 2,797.8 (1) Represents bonds issued, notes issued, and loans made to Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Integrys Energy Group records all principal obligations on the balance sheet. For purposes of this table, it is assumed that the current interest rates on variable rate debt will remain in effect until the debt matures. (2) Energy supply contracts at Integrys Energy Services included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy to customers. The utility subsidiaries expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates. (3) Includes obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations. (4) Obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, other than the Integrys Energy Group Retirement Plan, cannot be estimated beyond 2012. The table above does not reflect any payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $657.7 million at December 31, 2009, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. Integrys Energy Group anticipates incurring costs annually to remediate these sites, but management believes that any costs incurred for environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas plant operations that are not recoverable through contributions from other entities or from insurance carriers have been prudently incurred and are, therefore, recoverable through rates for WPS, MGU, PGL, and NSG. See Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information about environmental liabilities. In addition, the table does not reflect any payments for the December 31, 2009, liability related to uncertain tax positions, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. See Note 15, "Income Taxes," for more information about this liability. 60 Capital Requirements Estimated construction expenditures by company for the three year period 2010 through 2012 are listed below. (Millions) WPS Environmental projects $ 164.1 Electric and natural gas distribution projects 150.9 Electric and natural gas delivery and customer service projects 59.1 Other projects 108.0 UPPCO Repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 37.3 Other projects 28.4 MGU Natural gas pipe distribution system, underground natural gas storage facilities, and other projects 29.8 MERC Natural gas pipe distribution system and other projects 48.5 PGL Natural gas pipe distribution system, underground natural gas storage facilities, and other projects * 481.1 NSG Natural gas pipe distribution system and other projects 45.9 Integrys Energy Services Solar and other projects 88.9 IBS Corporate services infrastructure projects 53.7 Total capital expenditures $ 1,295.7 * Includes approximately $114 million of expenditures related to the accelerated replacement of cast iron mains at PGL in 2011 and 2012. On January 21, 2010, the ICC approved a rider mechanism to allow PGL to recover the incremental cost of an accelerated natural gas main replacement program. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information. Integrys Energy Group expects to provide additional capital contributions to ATC (not included in the above table) of approximately $7 million in 2010, $8 million in 2011, and $7 million in 2012. All projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2009, Integrys Energy Group and each of its subsidiaries were in compliance with all respective covenants related to outstanding short term and long term debt and expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. 61 See Note 12, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit," for more information on Integrys Energy Groups credit facilities and other short term credit agreements, including short term debt covenants. See Note 13, "Long Term Debt," for more information on Integrys Energy Groups long term debt covenants. Integrys Energy Group plans to meet its capital requirements for the period 2010 through 2012 primarily through internally generated funds (net of forecasted dividend payments) and debt and equity financings. During 2010, over $1.3 billion of Integrys Energy Groups revolving credit facilities will mature. It is the intent of management to renew a substantial portion of the maturing credit facilities by the end of the second quarter of 2010. Integrys Energy Group plans to maintain current debt to equity ratios at appropriate levels to support current credit ratings and corporate growth. Management believes Integrys Energy Group has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs. In March 2009, Integrys Energy Group filed a shelf registration statement which allows it to publicly issue debt, equity, certain types of hybrid securities, and other financial instruments. Specific terms and conditions of securities issued will be determined prior to the actual issuance of any specific security. Under an existing shelf registration statement, WPS may issue up to $250.0 million of senior debt securities with amounts, prices, and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. In December 2008, WPS issued $125.0 million of 6.375%, 7 year Senior Notes under this shelf registration statement. Other Future Considerations Integrys Energy Services Business Segment Strategy Change At December 31, 2009, Integrys Energy Group had completed a substantial portion of its previously announced strategy to divest of or significantly reduce the size of its nonregulated energy services business segment to a smaller segment with significantly reduced credit and collateral support requirements. One of the remaining parts of the strategy change is the pending sale of the wholesale electric business, which is expected to close in the first half of 2010. Integrys Energy Group has repositioned its nonregulated energy services business segment from a focus on significant growth in wholesale and retail markets across the United States and Canada, to a focus on selected retail markets in the United States with the expectation that recurring customer based business will result in dependable cash and earnings contributions with a reduced risk and capital profile. In addition, Integrys Energy Services will continue to invest in energy assets with renewable attributes. Once fully implemented, Integrys Energy Group expects its liquidity needs to decrease and expects to reduce its existing credit facilities. Integrys Energy Group may also use the proceeds from the sales of any portions of this business segment, as well as the return of invested capital, to reduce outstanding debt or invest in areas with more desirable risk adjusted rates of return to achieve the highest value for its shareholders. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for more information. Customer Usage Due to the general economic slowdown and the increased focus on energy efficiency, sales volumes excluding the impact of weather have been decreasing at the utilities. In certain jurisdictions, decoupling mechanisms have been implemented, which allow utilities to adjust rates going forward to recover or refund all or a portion of the differences between the actual and authorized margin per customer impact of variations in volumes. The mechanisms do not adjust for changes in volume resulting from changes in customer count. Decoupling for residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the ICC on a four year trial basis for PGL and NSG, effective March 1, 2008. Interveners, including the Illinois Attorney General, oppose decoupling and have appealed the ICCs approval. PGL and NSG are actively supporting the ICCs decision to approve decoupling. The PSCW approved the implementation of decoupling on a four year trial basis, effective January 1, 2009, for WPSs natural gas and electric residential and small commercial sales. This decoupling mechanism includes an annual $14.0 million cap 62 for electric service and an annual $8.0 million cap for natural gas service. The $14.0 million cap for electric service was reached in the second quarter of 2009. On December 16, 2009, decoupling for UPPCO was approved for all customer groups by the MPSC effective January 1, 2010. MGU requested decoupling in its rate case filed in July 2009. The partial settlement approved in that rate case did not address the decoupling request. Therefore the request will be addressed by the MPSC through the normal rate case process, which is expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2010. In Minnesota, the legislature required the MPUC to evaluate decoupling. The MPUC is currently engaged in that process and has sought and received comments on decoupling mechanisms from utilities and interveners in Minnesota. Uncollectible Accounts The reserves for uncollectible accounts at Integrys Energy Group reflect managements best estimate of probable losses on the accounts receivable balances. The reserves are based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors, including the impacts of the economy, energy prices, and weather. The impact of the weak economic environment could cause more accounts receivable to become uncollectible. Higher levels of uncollectible balances could negatively impact Integrys Energy Groups results of operations and could result in higher working capital requirements. Recoveries (or refunds) under Illinois Senate Bill (SB) 1918 and an Uncollectible Expense Tracking Mechanism (UETM) in Michigan will affect bad debt expense as described in Note 24, "Regulatory Environment." Goodwill Impairment Testing Integrys Energy Group performs its required annual goodwill impairment tests each April 1. Interim impairment tests are performed between required annual testing dates if certain conditions exist. One of these conditions is a change in business climate, which may be evidenced by, among other things, a prolonged decline in a companys market capitalization below book value. Any annual or interim goodwill impairment test could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss. See Note 10, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for more information on goodwill balances for Integrys Energy Groups reporting units at December 31, 2009. Climate Change Recently, efforts have been initiated to develop state and regional greenhouse gas programs, to create federal legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and to create national or state renewable portfolio standards. Some examples of these efforts are the Waxman Markey bill, which passed the United States House of Representatives; the Kerry Boxer draft bill, which was introduced in the United States Senate; and the Wisconsin Clean Energy Jobs Act, which has been introduced in the Wisconsin legislature to implement recommendations from the Governors Global Warming Task Force. The Wisconsin Clean Energy Jobs Act establishes statewide goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and requires certain actions, including an increased renewable portfolio standard, to meet those goals. In addition, in April 2009, the EPA declared carbon dioxide and several other greenhouse gases to be a danger to public health and welfare, which is the first step towards the EPA potentially regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. A risk exists that such legislation or regulation will increase the cost of energy. However, Integrys Energy Group believes the capital expenditures being made at its generation units are appropriate under any reasonable mandatory greenhouse gas program and that future expenditures related to control of greenhouse gas emissions or renewable portfolio standards by its regulated electric utilities will be recoverable in rates. Integrys Energy Group will continue to monitor and manage potential risks and opportunities associated with future greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory actions. The majority of Integrys Energy Groups generation and distribution facilities are located in the upper Midwest region of the United States. The same is true for the majority of our customers facilities. The physical risks posed by climate change are not expected to be significant at this time. Ongoing 63 evaluations will be conducted as more information on the extent of such physical changes becomes available. New Laws In February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law. ARRA contains various provisions intended to stimulate the economy. Included in ARRA are several tax provisions that may affect the company. Most notably, a provision of ARRA provides Integrys Energy Group with additional opportunities to claim tax deductions for bonus depreciation for certain assets placed in service during 2009, extending the bonus depreciation period established by the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. The additional first year deduction for bonus depreciation is estimated to be approximately $200 million. Other provisions of ARRA provide Integrys Energy Group with elections to select among a production tax credit, an investment tax credit, or a federal grant for various renewable generating facilities that went into service in 2009. Integrys Energy Group currently plans to take production tax credits on power generated by wind facilities, but is evaluating the other alternatives mentioned. In February 2009, Wisconsin Act 2 was signed into law. Act 2 contains various tax provisions intended to reduce Wisconsins current budget gap. Most notably, this Act will require Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries to file a Wisconsin income tax return as a combined group. As a result, all of Integrys Energy Groups income became subject to apportionment and taxation in Wisconsin beginning January 1, 2009. In the future, Integrys Energy Group may experience higher or lower Wisconsin income taxes depending on the mix and type of income. In the short term, after the adjustment to deferred taxes at the time of the law change, this law is expected to generate a small benefit for Integrys Energy Group. Property Tax Assessment on Natural Gas Integrys Energy Groups natural gas retailers, including its five natural gas utilities, purchase storage services from pipeline companies on the pipelines interstate natural gas storage and transmission systems. Once a shipper delivers natural gas to the pipelines system, that specific natural gas cannot be physically traced back to the shipper, and the physical location of that specific natural gas is not ascertainable. Some states tax natural gas as personal property and have recently sought to assess personal property tax obligations against natural gas quantities held as working gas in facilities located in their states. Because the pipeline does not have title to the working gas inventory in these facilities, the state imposes the tax on the shippers as of the assessment date, based on allocated quantities. Shippers that are being assessed a tax are actively protesting these property tax assessments. PGL and MERC are currently pursuing protests through litigation in Texas and Kansas, respectively. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS See Note 17, "Guarantees," for information regarding guarantees. MARKET PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of Integrys Energy Services. Integrys Energy Services measures the fair value of derivative instruments on a mark to market basis. The fair value is included in assets or liabilities from risk management activities on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets, with an offsetting impact to other comprehensive income (for the effective portion of cash flow hedges), also on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets, or to earnings. The following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of Integrys Energy Services assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the year ended December 31, 2009. 64 Integrys Energy Services Mark to Market Roll Forward (Millions) Natural Gas Electric Total Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2008 (1) $ 294.0 $ (135.4 ) $ 158.6 Less: Contracts realized or settled during period (2) 317.0 (225.9 ) 91.1 Plus: Changes in fair value of contracts in existence at December 31, 2009 (3) 60.0 (187.9 ) (127.9 ) Fair value of contracts at December 31, 2009 (1) $ 37.0 $ (97.4 ) $ (60.4 ) (1) Reflects the values reported on the balance sheets for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates. The fair value of contracts at December 31, 2008, includes $0.6 million of liabilities held for sale, related to the sale of generation assets and the associated sales and service contracts in Northern Maine, which closed during the first quarter of 2010. The fair value of Integrys Energy Services contracts at December 31, 2009, was impacted by the reduction in wholesale trading and marketing activity associated with its strategy change, as well as an overall decline in energy prices in 2009. (2) Includes the value of contracts in existence at December 31, 2008, that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of December 31, 2009. (3) Includes unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at December 31, 2008, and contracts that were entered into subsequent to December 31, 2008, which were included in Integrys Energy Services portfolio at December 31, 2009. There were, in many cases, derivative positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period. The realized gains or losses from these derivative positions are not reflected in the table above. The table below shows Integrys Energy Services risk management instruments categorized by fair value hierarchy levels and by maturity. For more information on the fair value hierarchy, including definitions of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, see Note 1(r), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fair Value." Integrys Energy Services Risk Management Contract Aging at Fair Value As of December 31, 2009 (Millions) Fair Value Hierarchy Level Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity in Excess of 5 years Total Fair Value Level 1 $ (52.2 ) $ 0.6 $ (0.3 ) $ $ (51.9 ) Level 2 (56.4 ) (75.7 ) 4.1 1.6 (126.4 ) Level 3 37.1 80.8 (0.6 ) 0.6 117.9 Total fair value $ (71.5 ) $ 5.7 $ 3.2 $ 2.2 $ (60.4 ) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Integrys Energy Group has determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of its financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. Integrys Energy Groups management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Risk Management Activities Integrys Energy Group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. All derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, which provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts. Changes in fair value, except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory 65 deferral, generally affect income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled. At December 31, 2009, those derivatives not designated as hedges were primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities. Cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when Integrys Energy Group enters into contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases. In addition, Integrys Energy Group uses cash flow hedge accounting to protect against changes in interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting may be used when Integrys Energy Group holds assets, liabilities, or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates. To the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged, there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge. In conjunction with the implementation of SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (now incorporated as part of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC), on January 1, 2008, Integrys Energy Group categorized its fair value measurements into three levels within a fair value hierarchy. See Note 1(r), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fair Value," and Note 22, "Fair Value," for more information. Integrys Energy Group has based its valuations on observable inputs whenever possible. However, at times, the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs. These valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management assets on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets, $1,593.0 million (68.7%) utilized Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management liabilities, $1,471.6 million (61.6%) utilized Level 3 measurements. Integrys Energy Group believes these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date; however, the actual amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets. Beginning January 1, 2008, Integrys Energy Services no longer includes transaction costs in fair value determinations. As a component of fair value determinations, Integrys Energy Group considers counterparty credit risk (including its own credit risk) and liquidity risk. The liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available. Changes in the underlying assumptions for these components of fair value at December 31, 2009, would have had the following effects: Change in Components Effect on Fair Value of Net Risk Management Liabilities at December 31, 2009 (Millions) 100% increase $15.8 decrease 50% decrease $7.9 increase These hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as part of nonregulated revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income, unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, in which case potential changes would be included in Other Comprehensive Income Cash Flow Hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholders Equity. 66 Asset Impairment Integrys Energy Group reviews certain assets for impairment as required by the Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic and Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASB ASC. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit. A reporting unit can be an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, as defined by the Segment Reporting Topic of the FASB ASC. At Integrys Energy Group, goodwill has been assigned to each of the five reporting units that comprise the natural gas utility segment and also to the Integrys Energy Services segment. The carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit and reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 was: (Millions) Carrying Value of Goodwill WPS $ 36.4 PGL 401.2 NSG 36.1 MERC 127.7 MGU 34.5 Total Natural Gas Utility Segment $ 635.9 Integrys Energy Services 6.6 Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 642.5 The goodwill for each of the reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 1 or more frequently when events or circumstances warrant. The fair market value of each reporting unit is estimated using certain key assumptions that require significant judgment. This judgment includes developing cash flow projections (including the selection of appropriate returns on equity, long term growth rates, and capital expenditure levels), selecting appropriate discount rates, and identifying relevant market comparables. The fair value of WPS currently exceeds the carrying amount by a significant amount, such that Integrys Energy Group believes WPS is unlikely to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test in the foreseeable future. However, in the first quarter of 2009, the combination of the decline in equity markets as well as the increase in the expected weighted average cost of capital indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill might exist for PGL, NSG, MERC, MGU, and Integrys Energy Services, triggering an interim goodwill impairment analysis effective February 28, 2009 for these reporting units. For this analysis, the estimated fair value for the PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU reporting units was determined by utilizing a combination of the income approach and the market approach methodologies. More weight was given to the income approach as Integrys Energy Group believes that the income approach more accurately captures the anticipated economics and related performance expectations for each of these reporting units. In the first quarter of 2009, Integrys Energy Group announced a strategy change for Integrys Energy Services. Because it was likely that Integrys Energy Group would sell a significant portion of Integrys Energy Services, the goodwill at Integrys Energy Services was tested for impairment during each interim period in 2009 as well as at the time of the April 1, 2009 annual testing date. At each testing date, the fair value of Integrys Energy Services exceeded its carrying amount. Based on the interim test performed at December 31, 2009, the fair value of Integrys Energy Services exceeded its carrying amount by more than 10%. The income approach was based on discounted cash flows which were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations. The key assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach included the cash flow period, terminal values based on a terminal growth rate, and the discount rate. The discount rate represents the estimated cost of debt and equity financing weighted by 67 the percentage of debt and equity in a companys target capital structure. The discount rates used in the income approach for PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU ranged from 7.25% to 7.5%. The discount rate used for Integrys Energy Services was 10.2%. The terminal growth rates used in the income approach ranged from 2% to 3%. The market approach for PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU utilized the guideline company method, which calculates valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from publicly traded guideline companies in the regulated natural gas distribution industry. Multiples derived from the guideline companies provided an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for an investment in a similar company. These multiples were then applied to the appropriate operating metric for PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU to determine indications of fair value. Aggregate fair values of all of Integrys Energy Groups operating segments were compared to its market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value measurements. When assessing Integrys Energy Groups market capitalization, the average stock price 15 days before and after the interim February 28, 2009, valuation date was used. The comparison between the aggregate fair values of all reporting units of Integrys Energy Group and the market capitalization indicated an implied control premium. A control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within a range of the overall premiums observed in the market place. As a result of applying the first step of goodwill impairment testing to determine if potential goodwill impairment existed at the February 28, 2009 interim testing date, Integrys Energy Services passed (fair value exceeded carrying amount) and PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU failed (carrying amount exceeded fair value). As a result, a $291.1 million pre tax impairment loss was recorded in the first quarter of 2009, which included a $148.0 million goodwill impairment loss related to PGL, a $38.2 million goodwill impairment loss related to NSG, a $16.7 million goodwill impairment loss related to MERC, and an $88.2 million goodwill impairment loss related to MGU. See Note 10, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for information. On the April 1, 2009 annual goodwill impairment testing date, an increase in equity values for United States companies, as well as a decrease in the discount rate since February 28, 2009, resulted in the fair values of PGL, NSG, MERC and MGU exceeding their respective carrying amounts. The resulting fair values exceeded the carrying amount by less than 10% for each of these four reporting units. Other Integrys Energy Group evaluates property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. These indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets, and significant negative industry or economic trends. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the income statement. For assets held for sale, impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value (or fair value less costs to sell if held for sale). For Integrys Energy Groups regulated utilities, an asset impairment requires further assessment to determine if a regulatory asset should be recorded. The review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to Integrys Energy Services than to any other segment because of its lack of access to rate setting based on cost of service that is available to the regulated segments. At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of Integrys Energy Services property, plant, and equipment totaled $143.9 million. Managements assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 68 The primary assumptions used at Integrys Energy Services in the impairment analyses are future revenue streams that depend on future commodity prices, capital expenditures, environmental landscape, and operating costs. A combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams. Integrys Energy Services forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources. These assumptions are modeled over the projected remaining life of the asset. Throughout 2009, Integrys Energy Services tested various assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that a test was required. No material impairment charges were recorded in 2009 as a result of the recoverability tests. Results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future results given the nature of the accounting estimates involved, as discussed more fully above. Future results or changes in assumptions could result in an impairment. Receivables and Reserves The regulated natural gas and electric utilities and Integrys Energy Services accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services rendered but not yet billed. Estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of factors based on customer class or contracted rates. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Integrys Energy Groups unbilled revenues were $337.0 million and $525.5 million, respectively. Any difference between actual revenues and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period. Differences historically have not been significant. The majority of the bad debt expense at the utilities is recovered through rates. Integrys Energy Services calculates the reserve for potential uncollectible customer receivable balances by applying an estimated bad debt experience rate to each past due aging category and reserving for 100% of specific customer receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible. If the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect, or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults, there could be significant changes to bad debt expense and the uncollectible reserve balance. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Integrys Energy Services reserve for uncollectible accounts was $19.4 million and $16.7 million, respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, described in Note 18, "Employee Benefit Plans," are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, discount rates used in determining the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Integrys Energy Groups pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. Management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at the regulated segments through the ratemaking process. The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost.

Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percentage Point Change in Assumption Impact on Postretirement Benefit Obligation Impact on 2009 Postretirement Benefit Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 29.0 $ 2.2 Discount rate 0.5 (27.1 ) (2.2 ) Health care cost trend rate (1.0 ) (48.4 ) (6.8 ) Health care cost trend rate 1.0 58.1 8.3 Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 1.1 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (1.1 ) Integrys Energy Group uses an interest rate yield curve to enable it to make appropriate judgments about discount rates. The yield curve is comprised of non callable (or callable with make whole provisions), high quality corporate bonds with maturities between 0 and 30 years. The included bonds are generally rated "Aa" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50 million. The expected annual benefit cash flows are discounted for each of Integrys Energy Groups pension and retiree welfare plans using this yield curve, and a single point discount rate is developed matching each plans expected payout structure. Integrys Energy Group establishes its expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long term rate of return was 8.5% in 2009, 2008, and 2007. For 2009, 2008, and 2007, the actual rates of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, were 22.0%, (25.9)%, and 6.2%, respectively. The determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. Cumulative gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the pension or other postretirement benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages. Changes in fair value are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans sponsored by WPS, while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for pension plans sponsored by IBS and PEC. Because of this method, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value. In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that Integrys Energy Group expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 18, "Employee Benefit Plans." Regulatory Accounting The electric and natural gas utility segments of Integrys Energy Group follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC, and the financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by 70 Integrys Energy Groups regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings at the utility segments, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the rate recovery period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income. The application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if the regulated electric and natural gas utility segments or a separable portion of those segments would no longer meet the criteria for application. Assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet, but rather classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write off of all of Integrys Energy Groups regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2009, would result in a 13.1% decrease in total assets and a 4.2% decrease in total liabilities. See Note 8, "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities," for more information. Environmental Activities Relating to Former Manufactured Gas Operations Integrys Energy Groups natural gas utilities, their predecessors, and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose of manufacturing and storing manufactured gas. The utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs incurred in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas plant sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities. The amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and managements best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites. Managements estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs. Management considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs, and the extent of recovery from other potential responsible parties. See Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies," for further discussion of environmental matters. Tax Provision Integrys Energy Group is required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of the process of preparing Integrys Energy Groups consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets. Integrys Energy Group must also assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent Integrys Energy Group believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 71 Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Integrys Energy Group adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FAS 109" (now incorporated as part of the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC), which requires that only income tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized. The change in the unrecognized tax benefits needs to be reasonably estimated based on an evaluation of the nature of uncertainty, the nature of event that could cause the change, and an estimate of the range of reasonably possible changes. As allowed under Interpretation No. 48, Integrys Energy Group also elected to change its method of accounting to record interest and penalties paid on income tax obligations as a component of provision for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining Integrys Energy Groups provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and technical interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on Integrys Energy Groups financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(o), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes," and Note 15, "Income Taxes," for a discussion of accounting for income taxes. IMPACT OF INFLATION Integrys Energy Groups financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The statements provide a reasonable, objective, and quantifiable statement of financial results, but generally do not evaluate the impact of inflation. For Integrys Energy Groups regulated operations, to the extent it is not recovering the effects of inflation, it will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Integrys Energy Groups nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs. 72 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks and Other Significant Risks Integrys Energy Group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk (including regulatory recovery risk), interest rate risk, and equity return and principal preservation risk. Integrys Energy Group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which we operate. Integrys Energy Group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures, as further described below. Commodity Price Risk and Regulatory Recovery Risk Utilities The electric utilities of Integrys Energy Group purchase natural gas, fuel oil, and coal for use in power generation. They also buy power from the MISO market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation. Prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by UPPCO and by the wholesale electric operations and Michigan retail electric operations of WPS. The costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utility subsidiaries are generally also recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms. These recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities. WPSs Wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations. Instead, a "fuel window" mechanism has partially mitigated the year to year price risk. See Note 1(e), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue and Customer Receivables," for more information. To manage commodity price risk, our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and electricity. In addition, the electric operations of WPS and the natural gas operations of WPS, PGL, NSG, and MERC employ risk management techniques, which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps, futures, and options. Integrys Energy Services Integrys Energy Services seeks to reduce market price risk from its generation and energy supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments. To measure commodity price risk exposure, Integrys Energy Group employs a number of controls and processes, including a value at risk (VaR) analysis of its exposures. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio (primarily natural gas and power positions), which also includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet. The VaR calculation excludes the long dated positions created by owning merchant generation and associated coal, sulfur dioxide emission allowances, and other ancillary fuels. Additionally, financial transmission rights, renewable energy credits, and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the VaR calculation. The capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions would result in a VaR that would not be representative of the actual exposure. Therefore, Integrys Energy Services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions which would represent the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract. 73 VaR is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors, within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period. VaR models are relatively sophisticated. However, the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model. The instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used. VaR is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. In addition to VaR, Integrys Energy Services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations, stress testing, and scenario based testing. In conjunction with the VaR analysis, these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for Integrys Energy Services risk exposure. Additionally, Integrys Energy Services also uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements. VaR has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results. Most importantly, VaR does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio. Price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported VaR. Large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions. Also, the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions. Short term reductions in market liquidity could cause Integrys Energy Services to hold positions open longer than anticipated, resulting in greater than predicted losses. Additionally, there are other risks not captured by the VaR metric including, but not limited to, the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which Integrys Energy Services transacts. Customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses, realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts, or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of our counterparties are not met. Market liquidity risk refers to the risk that Integrys Energy Services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions. Integrys Energy Services VaR is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a 95% confidence level, as well as a ten day holding period and 99% confidence level. The delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods, such as one day or ten days, are normally distributed. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options, as well as natural gas inventory, natural gas storage, and transportation contracts, to the extent such positions are significant, but excludes the positions mentioned above. The VaR for Integrys Energy Services portfolio at a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table: (Millions) 2009 2008 As of December 31 $ 0.6 $ 1.3 Average for 12 months ended December 31 0.8 1.4 High for 12 months ended December 31 1.1 2.3 Low for 12 months ended December 31 0.6 0.9 74 The VaR for Integrys Energy Services portfolio at a 99% confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented below: (Millions) 2009 2008 As of December 31 $ 2.9 $ 5.6 Average for 12 months ended December 31 3.8 6.2 High for 12 months ended December 31 4.7 10.2 Low for 12 months ended December 31 2.9 4.8 The average, high, and low amounts were computed using the VaR amounts at each of the four quarter ends. The year over year decrease in VaR was driven by a substantial reduction in trading activity, as a result of Integrys Energy Services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas and electric businesses, and its Canadian energy marketing business. Interest Rate Risk Integrys Energy Group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. Integrys Energy Group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so. Integrys Energy Group may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. Due to decreases in short term borrowings in the last year, Integrys Energy Group has decreased its exposure to variable interest rates. Based on the variable rate debt of Integrys Energy Group outstanding at December 31, 2009, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased annual interest expense by $3.5 million. Comparatively, based on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2008, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased interest expense by approximately $11.7 million. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period. Equity Return and Principal Preservation Risk Integrys Energy Group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds. The trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. Declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and possible future required contributions for the pension plans. Integrys Energy Group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices. Most of the employee benefit costs relate to Integrys Energy Groups regulated utilities. As such, the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates, mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures. Effective May 1, 2008, and July 1, 2008, the defined pension plans were closed to new union hires at PGL and NSG, respectively. Effective April 19, 2009, and December 18, 2009, the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new union hires at UPPCO and WPS, respectively. Effective January 15, 2010, the defined pension plans were closed to new Local 12295 union hires at MGU. 75
