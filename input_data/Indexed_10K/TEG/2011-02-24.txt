ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Integrys Energy Group is a diversified energy holding company with regulated natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), nonregulated energy operations, and an approximate 34% equity ownership interest in ATC (a federally regulated electric transmission company operating in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois). Strategic Overview Integrys Energy Groups goal is to create long term value for shareholders and customers through growth in its core regulated businesses. Integrys Energy Group also has a nonregulated energy services business segment that is smaller than it was historically with significantly reduced credit and collateral support requirements. The essential components of Integrys Energy Groups business strategy are: Maintaining and Growing a Strong Regulated Utility Base A strong regulated utility base is essential to maintaining a strong balance sheet, predictable cash flows, the desired risk profile, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings. This is critical to Integrys Energy Groups success as a strategically focused regulated business. Integrys Energy Group believes the following projects have helped, or will help, maintain and grow its regulated utility base and meet its customers needs: An accelerated annual investment in natural gas distribution facilities (primarily replacement of cast iron mains) at PGL. WPSs continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators. Capital projects to construct and or upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year. Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC, a transmission company that had over $2.9 billion of transmission assets at December 31, 2010. ATC plans to invest approximately $3.4 billion during the next ten years. Although ATCs equity requirements to fund its capital investments will primarily be met by earnings reinvestment, Integrys Energy Group plans to continue to fund its share of the equity portion of future ATC growth as necessary. For more detailed information on Integrys Energy Groups capital expenditure program, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources, Capital Requirements." Operating a Nonregulated Energy Services Business Segment with a Controlled Risk and Capital Profile Through its nonregulated Integrys Energy Services subsidiary, Integrys Energy Group provides retail natural gas and electric products to end use customers in the northeast quadrant of the United States. Integrys Energy Group has repositioned this subsidiary from a focus on significant growth in wholesale and retail electric markets across the United States and Canada, to a focus on operating within select retail electric and natural gas markets in its current market footprint where it has experience and believes it will have the most success growing its recurring customer based business. The current strategy is intended to result in more dependable c ash and earnings contributions with a controlled risk and capital profile. In addition, Integrys Energy Services continues to invest in and promote renewable energy in the United States. Clean, renewable, and efficient energy sources are developed, acquired, owned, and operated by Integrys Energy Services. Integrys Energy Services assists customers with selecting an energy solution that meets their needs and collaborates with energy developers of wholesale energy projects to overcome challenges with integrating the technical, regulatory, and financial aspects of their projects. 27 Integrating Resources to Provide Operational Excellence Integrys Energy Group is committed to integrating resources of all its businesses, while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and lowering costs. "Operational Excellence" initiatives were implemented to encourage top performance in the areas of project management, process improvement, contract administration, and compliance in order to reduce costs and manage projects and activities within appropriate budgets, schedules, and regulations. Placing Strong Emphasis on Asset and Risk Management Integrys Energy Groups asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of existing assets, the acquisition of assets, and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement its existing business and strategy. The goal is to provide the most efficient use of resources while maximizing return and maintaining an acceptable risk profile. This strategy focuses on acquiring assets consistent with strategic plans and disposing of assets, including property, plant, and equipment and entire business units, which are no longer strategic to ongoing operations, are not performing as needed, or have an unacceptable risk profile. Integrys Energy Group maintains a portfolio approach to risk and earnings. Integrys Energy Groups risk management strategy includes the management of market, credit, liquidity, and operational risks through the normal course of business. Forward purchases and sales of electric capacity, energy, natural gas, and other commodities and the use of derivative financial instruments, including commodity swaps and options, allow for opportunities to reduce the risk associated with price movement in a volatile energy market. Each business unit manages the risk profile related to these instruments consistent with Integrys Energy Groups risk management policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Risk Management Group, which reports through the Chief Financial Officer, provides corporate oversigh t. Continuing Emphasis on Safe, Reliable, Competitively Priced, and Environmentally Sound Energy and Energy Related Services Integrys Energy Groups mission is to provide customers with the best value in energy and energy related services. By effectively operating a mixed portfolio of generation assets and investing in new generation and natural gas distribution assets, while maintaining or exceeding environmental standards, Integrys Energy Group is able to provide a safe, reliable, value priced service to its customers. Integrys Energy Group concentrates its efforts on improving and operating efficiently in order to reduce costs and maintain a low risk profile. Integrys Energy Gr oup actively evaluates opportunities for adding more renewable generation to provide additional environmentally sound energy to its portfolio. Ensuring continued reliability for its customers, Integrys Energy Group is effectively operating a mixed portfolio of generation assets and investing in new generation and distribution assets. 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Year Ended December 31 (Millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009* 2008* Change in 2010 Over 2009 Change in 2009 Over 2008 Natural gas utility operations $ 84.0 $ (172.1 ) $ 84.5 N/A N/A Electric utility operations 109.8 88.9 92.6 23.5 % (4.0 )% Integrys Energy Services operations 3.3 3.8 (71.4 ) (13.2 )% N/A Electric transmission investment 46.2 45.5 39.7 1.5 % 14.6 % Holding company and other operations (22.4 ) (35.7 ) (28.9 ) (37.3 )% 23.5 % Net income (loss) attributed to common shareholders $ 220.9 $ (69.6 ) $ 116.5 N/A N/A Basic earnings (loss) per share $ 2.85 $ (0.91 ) $ 1.52 N/A N/A Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 2.83 $ (0.91 ) $ 1.51 N/A N/A Average shares of common stock Basic 77.5 76.8 76.7 0.9 % 0.1 % Diluted 78.0 76.8 77.0 1.6 % (0.3 )% * Certain amounts have been retrospectively adjusted due to a change in accounting policy in the fourth quarter of 2010. See Note 1(d), "Change in Accounting Policy," for more information. 2010 Compared with 2009 Integrys Energy Group recognized net income attributed to common shareholders of $220.9 million ($2.83 diluted earnings per share) in 2010 compared with a net loss attributed to common shareholders of $69.6 million ($0.91 net loss per share) in 2009. The primary driver of the $290.5 million increase in earnings was an after tax noncash goodwill impairment loss of $248.8 million recorded in 2009, compared with no goodwill impairment losses in 2010. Other factors contributing to the increase were the combined approximate $69 million after tax positive impact on margins of electric and natural gas distribution rate increases effective in 2010, and a $22.5 million after tax reduction in restructuring expenses year over year. These increases in earnings were partially offset by after tax impairme nt charges of $25.9 million in 2010 related to three natural gas fired generation plants at Integrys Energy Services. 2009 Compared with 2008 Integrys Energy Group recognized a net loss attributed to common shareholders of $69.6 million ($0.91 net loss per share) in 2009 compared with net income attributed to common shareholders of $116.5 million ($1.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2008. The primary drivers of the $186.1 million decrease in earnings were a $242.3 million after tax year over year increase in noncash goodwill impairment losses, $27.2 million of after tax restructuring charges recorded in 2009, and $17.3 million of after tax net losses on dispositions in 2009 related to the Integrys Energy Services strategy change. These decreases in earnings were partially offset by a $127.3 million after tax increase in margins at Integrys Energy Services, primarily due to the positive year over year impact of noncash invento ry valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods, partially offset by noncash accounting losses in 2009 versus noncash accounting gains in 2008 due to derivative fair value adjustments. 29 Regulated Natural Gas Utility Segment Operations Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Change in 2010 Over 2009 Change in 2009 Over 2008 Revenues $ 2,057.2 $ 2,237.5 $ 3,025.9 (8.1 )% (26.1 )% Purchased natural gas costs 1,152.0 1,382.0 2,147.7 (16.6 )% (35.7 )% Margins 905.2 855.5 878.2 5.8 % (2.6 )% Operating and maintenance expense 542.1 532.6 539.1 1.8 % (1.2 )% Goodwill impairment loss 291.1 6.5 (100.0 )% 4,378.5 % Restructuring expense (0.2 ) 6.9 N/A N/A Depreciation and amortization expense 130.9 106.1 108.3 23.4 % (2.0 )% Taxes other than income taxes 34.4 33.4 32.1 3.0 % 4.0 % Operating income (loss) 198.0 (114.6 ) 192.2 N/A N/A Miscellaneous income 1.6 3.1 7.0 (48.4 )% (55.7 )% Interest expense (49.7 ) (52.2 ) (56.6 ) (4.8 )% (7.8 )% Other expense (48.1 ) (49.1 ) (49.6 ) (2.0 )% (1.0 )% Income (loss) before taxes $ 149.9 $ (163.7 ) $ 142.6 N/A N/A Throughput in therms Residential 1,496.4 1,602.8 1,708.9 (6.6 )% (6.2 )% Commercial and industrial 455.5 501.4 550.8 (9.2 )% (9.0 )% Interruptible 39.8 51.3 60.1 (22.4 )% (14.6 )% Interdepartmental 13.9 9.5 28.6 46.3 % (66.8 )% Transport 1,728.4 1,641.6 1,834.0 5.3 % (10.5 )% Total throughput in therms 3,734.0 3,806.6 4,182.4 (1.9 )% (9.0 )% Weather Average heating degree days 6,440 7,061 7,257 (8.8 )% (2.7 )% 2010 Compared with 2009 Revenues Regulated natural gas utility segment revenues decreased $180.3 million year over year, driven by: An approximate $132 million decrease in revenues as a result of the 1.9% lower natural gas throughput volumes, related to: An approximate $76 million decrease driven by lower weather normalized volumes. Residential customer volumes decreased, which Integrys Energy Group attributes to energy conservation, efficiency efforts, and general economic conditions. In addition, some former MGU residential and small commercial and industrial retail customers have become transportation customers under a Michigan customer choice program, which resulted in reduced revenues of approximately $6 million in 2010 related to the pass through of the cost of natural gas but had no impact on margins. These decreases were partially offset by a year over year net increase in commercial and industrial sales volumes for both retail and transportation customers, driven by certain transportation customers of MERC and MGU. An approximate $66 million decrease as a result of warmer year over year weather during the heating season, as evidenced by the 8.8% decrease in average heating degree days. 30 Partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate $10 million positive year over year impact of decoupling mechanisms for residential, small commercial and industrial, and transportation customers. Under decoupling, certain of Integrys Energy Groups regulated natural gas utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction. The decoupling mechanism for WPSs natural gas utility includes an annual $8.0 million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin. This cap was reached in the first quarter of 2010 but was not reached in 2009. An approximate $127 million decrease in revenues as a result of an approximate 9% year over year decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold. For all of Integrys Energy Groups regulated natural gas utilities, prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in current rates. An approximate $18 million net decrease in revenues driven by lower recovery of approximately $25 million of environmental cleanup expenditures related to former manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by an approximate $7 million increase related to recoveries received in 2010 under the PGL and NSG bad debt riders. These amounts were offset by a net decrease in operating and maintenance expense resulting from lower net amortization of the related regulatory assets and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. Recoveries under these riders represent net billings to customers of the excess or deficiency of actual 2008 and 2009 bad debt expense over bad debt expense reflected in utility rates during those same periods. See Note 24, "Regulatory E nvironment," for more information on the PGL and NSG bad debt riders. Partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate $96 million positive impact of natural gas distribution rate increases. These rate increases were necessary, in part, to recover higher operating expenses (as discussed below). See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on these rate increases. The rate increases at PGL and NSG had an approximate $77 million positive impact on revenues. The rate increase at WPS had an approximate $13 million positive impact on revenues. The rate increase at MGU had an approximate $3 million positive impact on revenues. A rate increase at MERC related to its conservation improvement program had an approximate $3 million positive impact on revenues. This amount is offset by a corresponding increase in operating and maintenance expense and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. Margins Regulated natural gas utility segment margins increased $49.7 million year over year, driven by the approximate $96 million positive impact of the rate increases, partially offset by: An approximate $28 million decrease in margins resulting from lower natural gas throughput volumes, resulting from: An approximate $19 million decrease related to warmer year over year weather during the heating season. An approximate $19 million decrease related to lower weather normalized volumes, primarily attributed to residential customer conservation, efficiency efforts, and general economic conditions, partially offset by the favorable net impact of increased commercial and industrial sales volumes for certain retail and transportation customers of MERC and MGU. 31 Partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate $10 million positive impact from decoupling mechanisms in place at certain of Integrys Energy Groups regulated natural gas utilities. An approximate $18 million net decrease in margins driven by lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures related to former manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by an increase in margins related to recoveries received under the PGL and NSG bad debt riders. These amounts were offset by a net decrease in operating and maintenance expense resulting from lower net amortization of the related regulatory assets and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased $312.6 million year over year. This increase was primarily driven by the positive year over year impact of a $291.1 million noncash goodwill impairment loss that was recorded in the first quarter of 2009. Also contributing to the increase was the $49.7 million increase in the natural gas margins discussed above, partially offset by a $28.2 million increase in other operating expenses. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for information related to the goodwill impairment loss recorded in 2009. The $28.2 million year over year increase in other operating expenses primarily related to: A $24.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to the ICCs rate order for PGL and NSG, effective January 28, 2010, which allows earlier recovery in rates for net dismantling costs by including them as a component of depreciation rates applied to natural gas distribution assets. The increase also includes a $2.5 million write off of MGU assets for which rate recovery is currently being contested. A $12.9 million increase in expenses related to energy conservation programs and enhanced efficiency initiatives. A $9.8 million increase in employee benefit costs, primarily driven by an increase in other postretirement benefit costs. A $7.4 million increase in asset usage charges from IBS related to implementation of both a work asset management system for natural gas operations and a newer version of an Enterprise Resource Planning system for finance and supply chain services. A $4.9 million increase in stock based compensation expense. See Note 20, "Stock Based Compensation," for more information. These increases were partially offset by: An approximate $18 million net decrease due to approximately $25 million of lower amortization of the regulatory asset related to environmental cleanup expenditures for manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by approximately $7 million of amortization related to the regulatory assets recorded as a result of the PGL and NSG bad debt riders. This net decrease was passed through to customers in rates and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. A $7.1 million decrease in restructuring expenses recorded in 2009 related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for more information. A $6.1 million decrease in labor costs as a result of the reduction in workforce and company wide furloughs implemented as a part of previously announced cost management efforts. 32 2009 Compared with 2008 Revenues Regulated natural gas utility segment revenues decreased $788.4 million, driven by: An approximate $648 million decrease in revenues as a result of an approximate 30% decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold by the regulated natural gas utilities during 2009 compared with 2008. For all of Integrys Energy Groups regulated natural gas utilities, prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs are passed directly through to customers in current rates. An approximate $166 million decrease in revenues as a result of lower year over year natural gas throughput volumes, driven by: An approximate $83 million decrease related to lower weather normalized volumes, including residential customer volumes, resulting from customer conservation and efficiency efforts. Lower volumes were also driven by decreased commercial and industrial customer volumes resulting from reduced demand related to changes in customers plant operations and a decline in customer base at PGL and MGU, both of which Integrys Energy Group attributed to the general economic slowdown. An approximate $70 million decrease as a result of warmer year over year weather during the heating season as indicated by the 2.7% decrease in average heating degree days. An approximate $19 million decrease related to a reduction in volumes sold to the electric utility segment driven by the availability of lower cost power from MISO, resulting in a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by the $6 million positive impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for PGL and NSG on March 1, 2008, and for WPS on January 1, 2009. Under decoupling, these utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction. An approximate $20 million year over year net decrease in revenues from lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at PGL and NSG related to former manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by higher recovery of EEP expenses. The EEP program was established in the 2008 PGL and NSG rate cases and is designed to encourage energy efficiency initiatives. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by the approximate $29 million year over year net positive impact of natural gas distribution rate cases and changes in rate design at the regulated natural gas utilities. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on these rate cases. Effective January 14, 2009, MGU received a final rate order from the MPSC for a natural gas distribution rate increase. On June 29, 2009, MERC received a final rate order granting a natural gas distribution rate increase. Prior to this final order, MERC had been granted interim rate relief effective October 1, 2008. Together, these rate increases had an approximate $19 million positive impact on revenue. In 2009, PGL and NSG received the full impact of their 2008 natural gas distribution rate orders, which were effective February 14, 2008, and drove an approximate $5 million increase in revenue year over year. 33 Effective January 1, 2009, the PSCW required WPS to change its retail natural gas distribution rate design which incorporates higher volumetric rates and lower fixed customer charges. In 2009, revenue increased approximately $5 million related to this change in rate design. Margins Regulated natural gas utility segment margins decreased $22.7 million, driven by: An approximate $27 million year over year decrease in margins resulting from the 9.0% decrease in natural gas throughput volumes attributed to the negative impact of the general economic slowdown, customer conservation and efficiency efforts, and warmer year over year weather. This decrease in margins includes the impact of decoupling mechanisms that were first effective for PGL and NSG on March 1, 2008, and for WPS on January 1, 2009. The decoupling mechanism for WPSs natural gas utility includes an annual $8.0 million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin. Approximately $7 million of additional margin was recognized at WPS due to a shortfall from the rate case authorized margin during 2009. An approximate $20 million year over year net decrease in margins due to lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at PGL and NSG related to former manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by an increase in recovery of EEP expenses. This decrease in margin was offset by a net decrease in operating expense from both the amortization of the related regulatory asset and EEP expenses and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. An approximate $2 million year over year decrease in margins at MGU related to an adjustment in the third quarter of 2008 for recovery of natural gas costs in a MPSC proceeding. The decrease in margins was partially offset by the approximate $29 million net positive year over year impact of rate orders and impacts of rate design changes at the regulated natural gas utilities. Operating Income (Loss) Operating results at the regulated natural gas utility segment decreased $306.8 million, from operating income of $192.2 million in 2008, to an operating loss of $114.6 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by a year over year increase in noncash goodwill impairment losses of $284.6 million and the $22.7 million decrease in natural gas margin, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in other operating expenses. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for information related to the goodwill impairment losses recorded in 2009 and 2008. The year over year decrease in other operating expenses primarily related to: An approximate $20 million net decrease in amortization of the regulatory asset related to environmental cleanup expenditures of manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by an increase in EEP expenses. Both of these costs were recovered from customers in rates. A $17.7 million decrease in bad debt expense driven by the impact lower energy prices had on overall accounts receivable balances and the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at PGL, NSG, and MGU. PGL and NSG elected during the third quarter of 2009, under a new Illinois state law, to file for recovery from or refund to customers the difference between actual bad debt expense reported as a component of earnings and the bad debt expense included in utility rates retroactive to January 1, 2008. Bad debt expense also decreased as a result of MGUs rate order effective January 1, 2010, which established a bad debt expense tracking mechanism that allows for the deferral and subsequent recovery or refund of 80% of the difference between actual bad debt write offs (net of recoveries) and bad debt expe nse included in utility rates. The bad debt mechanism allowed recovery of a portion of the December 31, 2009 accounts receivable reserve representing future bad debt write offs. The decrease in bad debt expense attributed to the implementation of bad debt expense tracking mechanisms at the natural gas utilities was $9.3 million. 34 These decreases were partially offset by: A $13.4 million increase in employee benefit costs, partially related to an increase in pension expense resulting from negative pension investment returns in 2008, as well as higher health care expenses in 2009. Restructuring expenses of $6.9 million related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for more information. A $5.5 million increase in natural gas maintenance costs, primarily related to increased system inspection and maintenance requirements. A $5.0 million increase in expenses related to workers compensation claims. A $3.0 million charge related to an expected settlement with the ICC at PGL and NSG related to fiscal years 2001 through 2004 natural gas costs. See Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information. A $2.5 million increase in amortization of a regulatory asset related to conservation program initiatives.

These rate increases were necessary, in part, for recovery of higher operating expenses (as discussed below). An approximate $16 million increase in revenues due to a 7.5% increase in sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers at WPS, primarily related to changes in the business operations of these customers year over year. An approximate $13 million increase in revenues due to a 2.7% increase in sales volumes to residential customers and a 0.9% increase in sales volumes to small commercial and industrial customers at WPS, primarily related to warmer year over year weather during the cooling season as evidenced by the increase in cooling degree days. An approximate $4 million increase in opportunity sales at WPS, made possible by the availability of low cost energy from Weston 4. These increases in regulated electric utility segment revenues were partially offset by an approximate $18 million decrease in revenues from wholesale customers at WPS, primarily due to lower fuel costs. Fuel costs are passed directly through to wholesale customers in rates. Margins Regulated electric utility segment margins increased $57.9 million year over year, driven by: An approximate $26 million increase in margins driven by lower fuel and purchased power costs incurred during 2010 as compared with authorized fuel and purchased power cost recovery rates. The approximate $21 million combined positive impact of retail electric rate increases at both WPS and UPPCO, effective January 1, 2010. An approximate $7 million increase in margins due to a 2.7% increase in sales volumes to residential customers at WPS, primarily related to warmer year over year weather during the cooling season, as evidenced by the increase in cooling degree days. Margins were impacted by the year over year increase in sales volumes because WPS reached the annual $14.0 million electric decoupling cap in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 and remained over the cap through the end of both years. Therefore, no additional decoupling deferral was allowed for additional shortfalls from authorized margin for the remainder of both years. Under decoupling, WPS is allowed to defer (up to the established cap) the difference between its actual margin and the rate case authorized margin recognized from residential and small commerci al and industrial customers. An approximate $7 million increase in margins due to a 7.5% increase in sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers at WPS, primarily related to changes in the business operations of these customers year over year. These increases in regulated electric utility segment margins were partially offset by an approximate $2 million decrease in margins from WPSs wholesale customers, primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes. 36 Operating Income Operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased $38.2 million year over year, driven by the $57.9 million increase in margins, partially offset by a $19.7 million increase in operating expenses. The year over year increase in operating expenses was the result of: A $13.9 million increase in electric transmission expense. A $12.7 million increase in customer assistance expense related to payments made to the Focus on Energy program, which helps residents and businesses install cost effective, energy efficient, and renewable energy products. A $4.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to the Crane Creek Wind Farm being placed in service for accounting purposes in December 2009. A $3.9 million increase in stock based compensation expense. See Note 20, "Stock Based Compensation," for more information. A $3.6 million increase in employee benefit costs, primarily related to an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, driven by the amortization of negative investment returns on plan assets from prior years. These increases in regulated electric utility operating expenses were partially offset by: An $8.9 million year over year decrease in restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for more information. A $6.2 million decrease in labor costs, driven by the reduction in workforce and company wide furloughs implemented as part of previously announced cost management efforts. A $2.1 million decrease in electric maintenance expense at WPS, primarily related to a greater number of planned outages at its generation plants during 2009 compared with 2010. Other Expense Other expense at the regulated electric utility segment increased $5.6 million year over year, driven by a decrease in AFUDC, primarily related to the construction of the Crane Creek Wind Farm in 2009. 2009 Compared with 2008 Revenues Regulated electric utility segment revenues decreased $27.3 million year over year, driven by: A 5.5% decrease in commercial and industrial sales volumes and a 0.7% decrease in residential sales volumes, which resulted in an approximate $23 million year over year decrease in revenues, after the impact of decoupling. The primary drivers of the decrease were: An approximate $31 million year over year decrease due to lower demand related to changes in commercial and industrial customers plant operations, which Integrys Energy Group attributed mainly to the general economic slowdown. An approximate $6 million decrease primarily related to cooler year over year weather during the cooling season as evidenced by the decrease in cooling degree days at both WPS and UPPCO. 37 These decreases in volumes were partially offset by the $14.0 million impact that decoupling, which went into effect on January 1, 2009, had on WPSs revenue. The four year pilot program for electric decoupling has an annual $14.0 million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin. This cap was reached during the second quarter of 2009; therefore, no additional decoupling deferral was allowed for additional shortfalls from authorized margin for the second half of the year. An approximate $22 million year over year reduction in revenues related to refunds due to customers in both 2009 and 2008 related to WPSs over collection of fuel costs. On April 23, 2009, the PSCW made 2009 fuel cost recovery subject to refund, effective April 25, 2009, as actual and projected fuel costs for the remainder of the year were estimated to be below the 2% fuel window. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information on WPSs fuel window. An approximate $14 million year over year decrease in opportunity sales driven by lower demand and the availability of lower cost power from the MISO market. These decreases in regulated electric utility segment revenues were partially offset by: An approximate $19 million increase in revenues driven by higher wholesale volumes due to an increase in contracted sales volumes to a large wholesale customer and an increase in the wholesale demand rate, effective January 1, 2009, to recover costs related to Weston 4. An approximate $15 million increase in revenues from the combined effect of the July 4, 2008 fuel surcharge, a portion of which was incorporated into WPSs 2009 non fuel base retail electric rates, and the full years benefit of the 2008 retail electric rate increase, effective January 16, 2008, for WPS. Margins The regulated electric utility segment margins increased $39.7 million year over year, driven by: An approximate $20 million year over year increase in margins from wholesale customers related to increases in contracted sales volumes with an existing customer and an increase in the wholesale demand rate, effective January 1, 2009, to recover costs related to Weston 4. An approximate $14 million year over year increase in margins from the combined effect of the July 4, 2008 fuel surcharge, a portion of which was incorporated into WPSs 2009 non fuel base retail electric rates, and the full years benefit of the 2008 retail electric rate increase, effective January 16, 2008, for WPS. An approximate $11 million year over year increase in WPSs regulated electric utility margins due to fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $12 million lower than what was recovered in rates during 2009, compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were approximately $1 million lower than what was recovered in rates during 2008. The increase in margins was partially offset by an approximate $4 million year over year decrease in margin, after the impact of the WPS decoupling mechanism, caused by a 4.3% year over year decrease in sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers. The $14.0 million impact of decoupling partially offset the approximate $18 million decrease in margins due to lower sales volumes, which was attributed to the general economic slowdown and cooler year over year weather during the cooling season. 38 Operating Income Operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased $6.1 million year over year, driven by the $39.7 million increase in margins, partially offset by a $33.6 million increase in operating expenses. The year over year increase in operating expenses was driven by: $8.6 million in restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for more information. An $8.2 million increase in electric maintenance expenses at WPS, primarily related to a greater number of planned outages at the generation plants during 2009, compared with 2008. An $8.1 million increase in employee benefit costs, primarily related to an increase in pension expense driven partially by negative pension investment returns in 2008, as well as higher health care expenses in 2009. A $5.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense at WPS, primarily related to Weston 4 being placed in service for accounting purposes in April 2008. Other Expense Other expense at the regulated electric utility segment increased $6.1 million year over year, driven by: A $4.9 million increase in interest expense, primarily related to increased long term borrowings at WPS in December 2008. The additional borrowings were utilized to fund various construction projects, most notably the Crane Creek wind generation project in Iowa. A $2.5 million decrease in interest earned on the transmission facilities WPS funded on ATCs behalf. WPS was reimbursed by ATC for these transmission facilities in April 2008. Electric Transmission Investment Segment Operations 2010 Compared with 2009 Miscellaneous Income Miscellaneous income at the electric transmission investment segment increased $2.3 million during 2010, compared with 2009, due to an increase in income from Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. The increase in income was driven by returns earned by ATC on increased investment in transmission equipment and facilities for improved reliability. 2009 Compared with 2008 Miscellaneous Income Miscellaneous income at the electric transmission investment segment increased $9.2 million during 2009 compared with 2008, due to an increase in income from Integrys Energy Groups approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. The increase in income was driven by returns earned by ATC on increased investment in transmission equipment and facilities for improved reliability. 39 Integrys Energy Services Nonregulated Segment Operations Year Ended December 31 (Millions, except natural gas sales volumes) 2010 2009 (3) 2008 Change in 2010 Over 2009 Change in 2009 Over 2008 Revenues $ 1,823.7 $ 3,994.0 $ 9,735.2 (54.3 )% (59.0 )% Cost of fuel, natural gas, and purchased power 1,614.3 3,696.1 9,649.5 (56.3 )% (61.7 )% Margins 209.4 297.9 85.7 (29.7 )% 247.6 % Margin Detail Realized retail electric margins 85.4 (1) 82.0 62.3 4.1 % 31.6 % Realized wholesale electric margins (8.2 ) (2) 40.3 30.9 N/A 30.4 % Realized energy asset margins 34.5 37.9 28.5 (9.0 )% 33.0 % Fair value adjustments 36.0 29.9 (137.4 ) 20.4 % N/A Electric and other margins 147.7 190.1 (15.7 ) (22.3 )% N/A Realized retail natural gas margins 50.0 68.7 51.5 (27.2 )% 33.4 % Realized wholesale natural gas margins (3.3 ) 40.8 64.1 N/A (36.3 )% Lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 6.8 155.4 (167.3 ) (95.6 )% N/A Fair value adjustments 8.2 (157.1 ) 153.1 N/A N/A Natural gas margins 61.7 107.8 101.4 (42.8 )% 6.3 % Operating and maintenance expense 117.6 188.6 181.2 (37.6 )% 4.1 % Impairment losses on property, plant, and equipment 43.2 0.7 0.5 6,071.4 % 40.0 % Restructuring expense 8.3 27.2 (69.5 )% N/A Net loss on Integrys Energy Services dispositions related to strategy change 14.1 28.9 (51.2 )% N/A Depreciation and amortization 17.2 19.0 14.5 (9.5 )% 31.0 % Taxes other than income taxes 5.0 7.4 7.8 (32.4 )% (5.1 )% Operating income (expense) 4.0 26.1 (118.3 ) (84.7 )% N/A Miscellaneous income 9.1 6.0 8.7 51.7 % (31.0 )% Interest expense (6.7 ) (13.1 ) (12.1 ) (48.9 )% 8.3 % Other income (expense) 2.4 (7.1 ) (3.4 ) N/A 108.8 % Income (loss) before taxes $ 6.4 $ 19.0 $ (121.7 ) (66.3 )% N/A Physically settled volumes Retail electric sales volumes in kwh 12,647.9 15,045.3 16,561.3 (15.9 )% (9.2 )% Wholesale electric sales volumes in kwh 1,319.9 3,965.2 4,634.1 (66.7 )% (14.4 )% Retail natural gas sales volumes in bcf 133.3 236.7 336.0 (43.7 )% (29.6 )% Wholesale natural gas sales volumes in bcf 27.5 402.5 594.9 (93.2 )% (32.3 )% kwh kilowatt hours bcf billion cubic feet (1) This amount includes negative margin of $1.4 million related to the settlement of retail supply contracts in connection with Integrys Energy Services strategy change.

(3) Certain amounts have been retrospectively adjusted due to a change in accounting policy in the fourth quarter of 2010. See Note 1(d), "Change in Accounting Policy," for more information. 2010 Compared with 2009 Revenues Revenues decreased $2,170.3 million during 2010, compared with 2009, as a result of Integrys Energy Groups decision to reduce the scale, scope, and risk attributes of Integrys Energy Services by focusing on selected retail electric and natural gas markets in the United States and investments in energy assets with renewable attributes. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for a discussion of the dispositions completed in connection with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Also contributing to the decrease in revenues were lower energy prices, as the average market price of natural gas and electricity decreased approximately 7% and 4% respectively, year over year. 40 Margins Integrys Energy Services margins decreased $88.5 million during 2010, compared with 2009. The significant items contributing to the change in margins were as follows: Electric and Other Margins Realized retail electric margins Realized retail electric margins increased $3.4 million during 2010, compared with 2009, driven by: A $9.2 million increase in margins in the Illinois market, primarily driven by a change in pricing methodology and customer mix that was implemented as part of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. A $5.5 million increase in margins in the Michigan market. This increase was driven by higher sales volumes due to increased marketing efforts. The above increases in realized retail electric margins were partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in margins related to the sale of the Texas retail electric business in June 2010, driven by reduced sales volumes and a $1.4 million decrease related to the settlement of supply contracts. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for a discussion of this sale. Realized wholesale electric margins Realized wholesale electric margins decreased $48.5 million year over year, including negative margins of $9.3 million in 2010 related to the settlement of wholesale supply contracts in connection with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Wholesale transactions and structured origination activity were significantly scaled back in conjunction with Integrys Energy Services sale of substantially all of its United States wholesale electric marketing and trading business, which was completed in February 2010. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for more information on Integrys Energy Services sale of its United States wholesale electric marketing and trading business. Fair value adjustments Integrys Energy Services electric margins from fair value adjustments increased $6.1 million year over year. Fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily relate to derivative electric supply contracts used to economically hedge risks associated with electric sales contracts. Natural Gas Margins Realized retail natural gas margins Realized retail natural gas margins decreased $18.7 million during 2010, compared with 2009, driven by: A $7.6 million decrease driven by reduced sales volumes due to the sale of Integrys Energy Services Canadian retail natural gas portfolio in September 2009. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for a discussion of this sale. A $7.5 million decrease in margins in the Illinois market, primarily due to the negative year over year impact of the withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas from storage in the first half of 2009, resulting in higher realized margins during that period. Also contributing to the decrease were lower sales volumes resulting from Integrys Energy Services strategy change. 41 Realized wholesale natural gas margins Realized wholesale natural gas margins decreased $44.1 million year over year due to Integrys Energy Services completing the sale of substantially all of its wholesale natural gas business in December 2009. Additional components of the wholesale natural gas business were sold in March 2010 and May 2010. The remaining realized wholesale natural gas activity at Integrys Energy Services is related to residual contracts that will settle in the first half of 2011. The risks associated with these residual contracts are economically hedged. See Note 4, "Dispositions," for more information on Integrys Energy Services sale of its wholesale natural gas business. Lower of cost or market inventory adjustments Integrys Energy Services physical natural gas inventory is valued at lower of cost or market. When the market price of natural gas is lower than the carrying value of the inventory, write downs are recorded within margins to reflect inventory at the end of the period at its net realizable value. The lower of cost or market inventory write downs are offset by higher margins in future periods as the inventory that was written down is sold. The $148.6 million year over year decrease in margins from lower of cost or market inventory adjustments was driven by a lower volume of inventory withdrawn from storage in 2010 for which write downs had previously been recorded. Fair value adjustments Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins from fair value adjustments increased $165.3 million year over year. Fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily relate to financial instruments used to economically hedge risks associated with natural gas storage and transportation activity. Operating Income Integrys Energy Services operating income decreased $22.1 million year over year, driven by the $88.5 million decrease in margins discussed above, and a $43.2 million noncash impairment loss related to three natural gas fired generation plants in the third quarter of 2010. These decreases were partially offset by a $71.0 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense, an $18.9 million decrease in restructuring expense, and a $14.8 million decrease in the net loss on Integrys Energy Services dispositions related to its strategy change (which primarily resulted from mark to market timing differences that have historically caused earnings volatility at Integrys Energy Services). The decrease in operating and maintenance expense was driven by: A $46.0 million year over year decrease in employee payroll and benefit related expenses, primarily due to the reduction in workforce associated with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. A $10.5 million year over year decrease in bad debt expense driven by the partial recovery in 2010 of receivables fully reserved in prior years, and a decrease in reserves resulting from reduced business activity. The $9.0 million positive year over year impact of a fee incurred in the second quarter of 2009 related to an agreement with a counterparty that enabled Integrys Energy Services to reduce collateral support requirements. An $8.0 million year over year decrease in broker commissions, contractor expenses, and various other fees, resulting from reduced business activity associated with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. The above decreases in operating and maintenance expense were partially offset by $8.1 million of intercompany fees related to a credit agreement established in 2010 with the holding company. 42 Other Income (Expense) Integrys Energy Services other income increased $9.5 million year over year, driven by a $4.3 million gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income in 2010 related to foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in prior periods, as well as a $6.4 million decrease in interest expense driven by reduced business size, as a result of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. 2009 Compared with 2008 Revenues Revenues decreased $5,741.2 million in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily due to: Lower energy prices, as the average market price of natural gas and electricity decreased approximately 45% and 40% year over year, respectively. Lower sales volumes, as wholesale transactions were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of 2008 and Integrys Energy Services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas and electric businesses. Margins Integrys Energy Services margins increased $212.2 million in 2009, compared with 2008. The significant items contributing to the change in margin were as follows: Electric and Other Margins Realized retail electric margins The realized retail electric margin increased $19.7 million year over year, driven by: A $14.1 million increase in the more mature markets, such as Illinois and New York, as Integrys Energy Services realized the benefits of including higher capital costs in its pricing in the first half of the year. A $6.5 million increase from operations in the Texas market. This increase was a result of the positive year over year impact of lower ancillary service costs compared to the prior year and the effects of Hurricane Ike in the third quarter of 2008. Hurricane Ike disrupted the electric infrastructure in Texas for a period of time, causing some of Integrys Energy Services customers to be without electricity or buy only a fraction of their normal energy usage during that period. Realized wholesale electric margins Realized wholesale electric margins increased $9.4 million year over year. In general, realized margins are impacted by transaction activity in prior periods, as Integrys Energy Services recognizes realized margin when the contracts actually settle, which typically occurs over a 12 to 24 month period from the time the contract was actually entered into. In 2009, realized margins benefited from the settlement of contracts that were entered into prior to the implementation of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Wholesale transactions and structured origination activity were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of 2008 and continued to be scaled back with Integrys Energy Services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale electric business. 43 Fair value adjustments Integrys Energy Services electric margins from fair value adjustments increased $167.3 million year over year. Fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily relate to derivative electric supply contracts used to economically hedge risks associated with electric sales contracts. The fair value adjustments recorded in 2009 include margin reductions of $2.0 million related to the settlement of derivative contracts entered into with the purchaser of the Canadian electric power portfolio, as discussed in Note 4, "Dispositions." Natural Gas Margins Realized retail natural gas margins Realized retail natural gas margins increased $17.2 million, due to Integrys Energy Services withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas during 2009 in order to improve its liquidity position, recognizing realized gains on these natural gas storage withdrawals. Also, per unit retail natural gas margins were higher year over year as more recently contracted sales commitments reflect increased business risk and financing costs in the pricing. Offsetting the increase was a decrease in Integrys Energy Services natural gas sales volumes year over year. Integrys Energy Services significantly reduced the number of natural gas storage transactions entered into as Integrys Energy Group implemented its strategy change for its nonregulated energy services business segment. Realized wholesale natural gas margins Realized wholesale natural gas margins decreased $23.3 million year over year. Wholesale natural gas transactions were scaled back in conjunction with the global credit crisis in the latter half of 2008 and Integrys Energy Services strategy change and ultimate decision to exit its wholesale natural gas business. The reduced activity had a negative impact on realized margins in 2009. Lower of cost or market inventory adjustments The combination of lower of cost or market inventory write downs and withdrawals of natural gas from storage for which write downs had previously been recorded resulted in a $322.7 million year over year increase in natural gas margins. The average market price of natural gas decreased approximately 5% during 2009 and decreased approximately 22% during 2008, driving a positive year over year change in natural gas margins of $129.2 million related to lower of cost or market inventory write downs. The natural gas withdrawn from storage and sold to customers in 2009 had a $193.5 million lower cost basis as a result of lower of cost or market inventory write downs recorded in prior periods. Fair value adjustments Integrys Energy Services natural gas margins from fair value adjustments decreased $310.2 million year over year. Fair value adjustments required under derivative accounting rules primarily relate to financial instruments used to economically hedge risks associated with natural gas storage and transportation activity. The fair value adjustments recorded in 2009 include a net increase in margin of $14.4 million related to the settlement of derivative contracts entered into with the purchasers of the wholesale natural gas marketing business and the Canadian natural gas portfolio, as discussed in Note 4, "Dispositions." 44 Operating Income (Loss) Integrys Energy Services operating income increased $144.4 million year over year. This increase resulted from the $212.2 million increase in margin discussed above, partially offset by losses of $28.9 million related to dispositions completed in connection with the strategy change; $27.2 million of restructuring expenses, which included employee related costs, the write off of capitalized development costs related to software that will not be utilized because of the restructuring, and consulting and legal fees; a $7.4 million increase in operating and maintenance expense; and a $4.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to renewable energy asset additions. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by a one time $9.0 million novation fee related to an agreement with a counterparty that enabled Integrys Energy Services to reduce collateral support requirements. See Note 3, "Restructuring Expense," for a discussion of restructuring charges. Holding Company and Other Segment Operations Change in Change in Year Ended December 31 2010 Over 2009 Over (Millions) 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 Operating income (loss) $ 8.3 $ (1.9 ) $ (0.7 ) N/A 171.4 % Other expense (45.9 ) (58.1 ) (53.2 ) (21.0 )% 9.2 % Net loss before taxes $ (37.6 ) $ (60.0 ) $ (53.9 ) (37.3 )% 11.3 % 2010 Compared with 2009 Operating Income (Loss) Operating income at the holding company and other segment increased $10.2 million, driven by $8.1 million of intercompany fees charged by the holding company to Integrys Energy Services related to a credit agreement established in 2010. Other Expense Other expense at the holding company and other segment decreased $12.2 million, driven by a $14.6 million decrease in external interest expense. 2009 Compared with 2008 Operating Income (Loss) Operating loss at the holding company and other segment increased $1.2 million during 2009 compared with 2008, driven by restructuring expenses related to Integrys Energy Groups reduction in workforce, and by a decrease in operating income from MERCs nonutility home services business. Other Expense Other expense at the holding company and other segment increased $4.9 million during 2009 compared with 2008, driven by a $4.3 million increase in interest expense at the holding company primarily due to an increase in long term borrowings in the second quarter of 2009 and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing fees related to credit facilities entered into in the second quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on commercial paper. 45 Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 * 2008 * Effective Tax Rate 39.9 % 624.6 % 34.7 % * Percentages have been retrospectively adjusted due to a change in accounting policy in 2010. See Note 1(d), "Change in Accounting Policy," for more information. 2010 Compared with 2009 The effective tax rate for 2010 decreased compared with 2009 primarily because a significant portion of Integrys Energy Groups $291.1 million noncash pre tax goodwill impairment loss recorded in 2009 was not deductible for tax purposes. Also contributing to the change in the year over year effective tax rate was the elimination of the deductibility of prescription drug payments to retirees, to the extent those payments will be offset by the receipt of the Medicare Part D subsidy, as mandated in the 2010 federal health care legislation. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Future Considerations Federal Health Care Reform" for more information. As a result of this legislation, Integrys Energy Group expensed $10.8 million of noncash defe rred income tax benefits during 2010, which were previously recognized as a reduction in the provision for income taxes. This amount excluded $1.0 million for which UPPCO was authorized recovery from ratepayers. 2009 Compared with 2008 The effective tax rate for 2009 increased compared with 2008 primarily because a significant portion of Integrys Energy Groups $291.1 million noncash pre tax goodwill impairment loss was not deductible for tax purposes. Although Integrys Energy Group had $13.4 million of income before taxes for 2009, it recorded an $83.7 million provision for income taxes because $186.2 million of the total pre tax goodwill impairment loss was not deductible for income tax purposes. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 2010 Compared with 2009 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $2.6 million in 2010 compared with 2009. During 2009, Integrys Energy Services recognized a $3.9 million ($2.4 million after tax) gain on the sale of its energy management consulting business in discontinued operations. During 2010, Integrys Energy Services recorded a $0.2 million after tax gain in discontinued operations when contingent payments were earned related to the sale of this business. 2009 Compared with 2008 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $1.9 million in 2009 compared with 2008. During 2009, Integrys Energy Services completed the sale of its energy management consulting business. The gain on the sale of this business recorded in discontinued operations was $3.9 million ($2.4 million after tax). During 2008, Integrys Energy Services recognized a $6.3 million ($3.8 million after tax) gain on the sale of its subsidiary, Mid American Power, LLC, in discontinued operations when a contingent payment was earned. For more information on the discontinued operations discussed above, see Note 4, "Dispositions," and Note 25, "Segments of Business." 46 BALANCE SHEET Cash and cash equivalents increased $134.5 million, from $44.5 million at December 31, 2009, to $179.0 million at December 31, 2010. For a detailed explanation of the change in the cash and cash equivalents balance, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Collateral on deposit decreased $151.6 million (82.0%), from $184.9 million at December 31, 2009, to $33.3 million at December 31, 2010. Collateral on deposit at Integrys Energy Services decreased $155.9 million, driven by reduced business size as a result of its strategy change. At December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, total assets from risk management activities decreased $1,991.2 million (85.9%) and total liabilities from risk management activities decreased $2,000.9 million (83.7%). At Integrys Energy Services, total assets from risk management activities decreased $1,988.0 million and total liabilities from risk management activities decreased $2,000.0 million, driven by reduced business size as a result of its strategy change. Detailed explanations for changes in the short term and long term debt balances year over year are included in Note 11, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit," and Note 12, "Long Term Debt." Detailed explanations for changes in the deferred income taxes balances year over year are included in Note 14, "Income Taxes." Asset retirement obligations increased $126.1 million (64.7%) from $194.8 million at December 31, 2009, to $320.9 million at December 31, 2010. Asset retirement obligations increased $123.7 million at PGL due to revisions made to estimated cash flows related to asset retirement obligations for natural gas distribution pipes. See Note 13, "Asset Retirement Obligations," for more information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Integrys Energy Group believes that its cash balances, liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to equity and debt capital markets, and available borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. Integrys Energy Groups borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies, as well as the market rates for interest. Integrys Energy Groups operating cash flows and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. Operating Cash Flows 2010 Compared with 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities was $725.2 million during 2010, compared with $1,606.3 million during 2009. The $881.1 million year over year decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by: A $746.5 million net decrease in cash provided by working capital, driven by: A $767.2 million year over year decrease in cash generated from customer collections, primarily due to the Integrys Energy Services strategy change, as well as lower year over year natural gas prices, which impacted both the regulated natural gas segment and Integrys Energy Services. A $393.0 million year over year decrease in cash generated from reduced inventory levels, mainly the result of the withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas from storage at Integrys Energy Services during 2009 in order to improve its liquidity position. 47 Partially offsetting these changes was a $578.9 million year over year decrease in cash used to pay accounts payable balances, driven by smaller accounts payable balances at Integrys Energy Services as a result of the strategy change, as well as lower year over year natural gas prices. Also offsetting these changes was a year over year increase in cash flows of $118.1 million due to a decrease in cash collateral provided to counterparties, due primarily to the change in Integrys Energy Services business related to its strategy change. A $175.8 million year over year increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits, primarily driven by a change in tax accounting related to capitalization of overhead costs and legislation providing for bonus depreciation during 2010. A $148.5 million year over year increase in contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,606.3 million during 2009, compared with net cash used for operating activities of $250.0 million during 2008. The $1,856.3 million year over year increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by a $1,734.8 million decrease in working capital requirements, partially due to a $444.1 million decrease in inventories during 2009, compared with a $312.0 million increase in inventories during 2008. This change was primarily a result of an increase in natural gas withdrawn from storage in 2009 due to the previously announced strategy change at Integrys Energy Services, as well as lower year over year natural gas prices. Also contributing to the decrease in working capital requirements was an $864.8 million decrease in accounts receivables and accrued unbilled revenues during 2009, compared with a $207.7 million increase in accounts receivables and accrued unbilled revenues during 2008, primarily the result of lower natural gas prices and the Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Additionally, during 2009, Integrys Energy Group had a $45.5 million net return of margin from various exchanges, compared with the net payment of $239.2 million of margin posted to various exchanges during 2008, primarily due to the strategy change. Partially offsetting these changes was a $604.7 million decrease in accounts payable during 2009, compared with a $53.2 million decrease in accounts payable during 2008, primarily the result of lower natural gas prices. Investing Cash Flows 2010 Compared with 2009 Net cash used for investing activities was $199.7 million during 2010, compared with $440.7 million during 2009. The $241.0 million year over year decrease in net cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by a $185.4 million year over year decrease in cash used to fund capital expenditures (discussed below), as well as a $27.2 million year over year decrease in capital contributions to equity method investments during 2010, mainly related to ATC capital contributions. Also contributing to the year over year decrease in net cash used for investing activities was a year over year increase in proceeds received from the sale or disposal of assets, primarily related to Integrys Energy Services strategy change. For more information on these dispositions, see Note 4, "Dispositions." 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash used for investing activities was $440.7 million during 2009, compared with $452.2 million during 2008. The $11.5 million year over year decrease in net cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by the $88.6 million decrease in cash used to fund capital expenditures (discussed below) and the payment of $17.4 million in 2008 related to WPSs funding of the construction of the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4, partially offset by the 2008 reimbursement of $99.7 million from ATC related to WPSs construction of the transmission facilities required to support Weston 4. 48 Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Reportable Segment (millions) 2010 2009 2008 Electric utility $ 87.2 $ 250.4 $ 207.4 Natural gas utility 133.6 136.9 237.3 Integrys Energy Services 15.2 22.4 68.1 Holding company and other 22.8 34.5 20.0 Integrys Energy Group consolidated $ 258.8 $ 444.2 $ 532.8 The decrease in capital expenditures at the electric utility segment in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to decreased expenditures related to the Crane Creek Wind Farm project, which was placed in service for accounting purposes in December 2009. The decrease in capital expenditures at the holding company and other segment was mainly due to lower expenditures in 2010 related to software projects. The increase in capital expenditures at the electric utility segment in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the Crane Creek Wind Farm project, partially offset by the year over year decrease in capital expenditures associated with Weston 4. The decrease in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility segment in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in costs related to the construction of natural gas laterals that connected WPSs natural gas distribution system to the Guardian II natural gas pipeline, which was completed in February 2009. The decrease in capital expenditures at Integrys Energy Services in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily driven by fewer expenditures related to renewable energy projects in 2009 compared with 2008. Financing Cash Flows 2010 Compared with 2009 Net cash used for financing activities was $391.4 million during 2010, compared with $1,378.4 million during 2009. The $987.0 million year over year decrease in net cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by: A $761.5 million year over year decrease in the net repayment of short term borrowings. A $298.6 million decrease due to net natural gas loan proceeds at Integrys Energy Services of $15.4 million during 2010, compared with the net repayment of $283.2 million of natural gas loans during 2009. Partially offsetting these changes were $157.8 million of payments made during 2010 to buyers of the wholesale natural gas and electric businesses and payments for settlement of out of the money transactions that were executed at the time of sale, compared with $33.9 million of proceeds received upon the sale of substantially all of the wholesale natural gas business during 2009. The out of the money transactions were replacement supply trades for the retained retail operations and were transacted at the original transfer price between Integrys Energy Services wholesale and retail businesses. Payments made to the buyers to settle the replacement supply contracts were funded with proceeds received from the settlement of the related retail electric and retail natural gas sales contracts. 49 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash used for financing activities was $1,378.4 million during 2009, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $911.3 million during 2008. The $2,289.7 million year over year increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by $973.6 million of net repayments of short term debt and notes payable in 2009, compared with $725.4 million of net short term and notes payable borrowings in 2008. The repayments in 2009 were made possible by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities. Also, as a result of the previously announced strategy change at Integrys Energy Services, fewer structured natural gas loan agreements were entered into in 2009, compared with 2008, resulting in a $368.4 million year over year decrease in proceeds from the sale of borrowed natural gas. Additionally, Integrys Energy Services had a $188.0 million year over year increase in the purchase of natural gas to repay structured natural gas loan agreements, many of which were entered into in 2008. Significant Financing Activities The quarterly common stock dividend per share in 2010 remained the same as in 2009. In February 2009, Integrys Energy Group increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 68 cents per share. Beginning February 11, 2010, Integrys Energy Group issued new shares of common stock to meet the requirements of its Stock Investment Plan, Dividend Reinvestment Plan, and certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. From January 1, 2010 to February 10, 2010, and during 2009, Integrys Energy Group purchased shares of its common stock on the open market to meet the requirements of these plans. Integrys Energy Group had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2010, and $212.1 million at December 31, 2009. Integrys Energy Group had short term notes payable outstanding of $10.0 million at December 31, 2010, and 2009. Integrys Energy Group had no borrowings under revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2010, and 2009. See Note 11, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit," for more information. For information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt at Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries, see Note 12, "Long Term Debt." Credit Ratings Integrys Energy Group uses internally generated funds, commercial paper borrowings, and other short term borrowings to satisfy most of its capital requirements. Integrys Energy Group also periodically issues long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. Integrys Energy Group, WPS, and PGL have their own commercial paper borrowing programs. WPS periodically issues long term debt and receives equity contributions from Integrys Energy Group to reduce short term debt, fund future growth, and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the PSCW. PGL and NSG periodically issue long term debt in order to reduce short term debt, refinance maturing securities, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. The specific forms of long term financing, amounts, and timing depend on business needs, market conditions, and other factors. 50 The current credit ratings for Integrys Energy Group, WPS, PGL, and NSG are listed in the table below. Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys Integrys Energy Group Issuer credit rating BBB+ N/A Senior unsecured debt BBB Baa1 Commercial paper A 2 P 2 Credit facility N/A Baa1 Junior subordinated notes BBB Baa2 WPS Issuer credit rating A A2 First mortgage bonds N/A Aa3 Senior secured debt A Aa3 Preferred stock BBB Baa1 Commercial paper A 2 P 1 Credit facility N/A A2 PGL Issuer credit rating BBB+ A3 Senior secured debt A A1 Commercial paper A 2 P 2 NSG Issuer credit rating BBB+ A3 Senior secured debt A A1 Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy or sell securities and are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. On January 21, 2011, Standard & Poors revised the outlook for Integrys Energy Group, PGL, and NSG to "positive" from "stable." According to Standard & Poors, the revised outlook reflects their view that there is at least a one in three probability that Integrys Energy Group will improve its business risk profile over the intermediate term and maintain its improved financial measures despite its increased capital spending. WPSs outlook remains "stable." On May 27, 2010, Moodys revised the outlook for Integrys Energy Group and all of its subsidiaries to "stable" from "negative." According to Moodys, the revised outlook reflected a reduced business risk profile driven by the recently completed restructuring of Integrys Energy Services into a smaller segment with significantly reduced collateral requirements. Moodys also raised the following ratings of Integrys Energy Groups subsidiaries: The senior secured debt rating and first mortgage bonds rating of WPS were raised from "A1" to "Aa3." The senior secured debt ratings of PGL and NSG were raised from "A2" to "A1." According to Moodys, the upgrade follows the August 2009 upgrade of the senior secured ratings of the majority of its investment grade regulated utilities (issuers with negative outlooks were excluded from the August 2009 upgrade). 51 Future Capital Requirements and Resources Contractual Obligations The following table shows the contractual obligations of Integrys Energy Group, including its subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2010. Payments Due By Period (Millions) Total Amounts Committed 2011 2012 to 2013 2014 to 2015 2016 and Thereafter Long term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 3,634.9 $ 595.2 $ 770.2 $ 381.4 $ 1,888.1 Operating lease obligations 56.4 9.8 17.7 7.8 21.1 Commodity purchase obligations (2) 2,828.8 743.5 947.4 430.3 707.6 Purchase orders (3) 233.1 230.3 2.8 Pension and other postretirement funding obligations (4) 627.3 132.1 214.0 120.0 161.2 Uncertain tax positions (5) 3.3 3.3 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,383.8 $ 1,714.2 $ 1,952.1 $ 939.5 $ 2,778.0 (1) Represents bonds issued, notes issued, and loans made to Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Integrys Energy Group records all principal obligations on the balance sheet. For purposes of this table, it is assumed that the current interest rates on variable rate debt will remain in effect until the debt matures. (2) Energy supply contracts at Integrys Energy Services included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy to customers. The utility subsidiaries expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates. (3) Includes obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations. (4) Obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, other than the Integrys Energy Group Retirement Plan, cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2013. (5) The obligation for the liability of $27.1 million related to uncertain tax positions that extend beyond 2011 is not reflected in the table as the amount and timing of the payments are uncertain. See Note 14, "Income Taxes," for more information on uncertain tax positions. The table above does not reflect any payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $642.5 million at December 31, 2010, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. Integrys Energy Group anticipates incurring costs annually to remediate these sites, but management believes that any costs incurred for environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas plant operations that are not recoverable through contributions from other entities or from insurance carriers have been prudently incurred and are, therefore, recoverable through rates for WPS, MGU, PGL, and NSG. See Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information about environmental liabilities. 52 Capital Requirements As of December 31, 2010, capital expenditures by company for the three year period 2011 through 2013 were anticipated to be as follows: (Millions) WPS Environmental projects $ 316.8 Electric and natural gas distribution projects 123.5 Electric and natural gas delivery and customer service projects 32.8 Other projects 123.9 UPPCO Repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 10.3 Other projects 36.1 MGU Natural gas pipe distribution system, underground natural gas storage facilities, and other projects 32.9 MERC Natural gas pipe distribution system and other projects 51.3 PGL Natural gas pipe distribution system, underground natural gas storage facilities, and other projects (1) 610.9 NSG Natural gas pipe distribution system and other projects 48.6 Integrys Energy Services Solar and other projects (2) 162.0 IBS Corporate services infrastructure projects 66.6 Total capital expenditures $ 1,615.7 (1) Includes approximately $300 million of incremental expenditures related to the accelerated replacement of cast iron mains at PGL in 2011, 2012, and 2013. On January 21, 2010, the ICC approved a rider mechanism to allow PGL to recover these incremental costs. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information. (2) Includes approximately $90 million of equity capital expected to be contributed through 2012 to INDU Solar Holdings, LLC, which was created in October 2010 through wholly owned subsidiaries of both Integrys Energy Services and Duke Energy Generation Services to build and finance distributed solar projects throughout the United States. Integrys Energy Group expects to provide additional capital contributions to ATC (not included in the above table) of approximately $10 million in 2011, $10 million in 2012, and $5 million in 2013. All projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. 53 Capital Resources Management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its business segments. This includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity, to determine cash management policies, to utilize risk management policies to hedge the impact of volatile commodity prices, and to make decisions regarding capital requirements. Integrys Energy Group plans to meet its capital requirements for the period 2011 through 2013 primarily through internally generated funds (net of forecasted dividend payments) and debt and equity financings. During 2011, approximately $900 million of Integrys Energy Groups revolving credit facilities will mature. It is the intent of management to renew a substantial portion of the maturing credit facilities before the end of the second qua rter of 2011. Integrys Energy Group plans to maintain current debt to equity ratios at appropriate levels to support current credit ratings and corporate growth. Management believes Integrys Energy Group has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs. Under an existing shelf registration statement, Integrys Energy Group may issue debt, equity, certain types of hybrid securities, and other financial instruments. Specific terms and conditions of securities issued will be determined prior to the actual issuance of any specific security. Under an existing shelf registration statement, WPS may issue up to $250.0 million of senior debt securities with amounts, prices, and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. In December 2008, WPS issued $125.0 million of 6.375%, 7 year Senior Notes under this shelf registration statement. At December 31, 2010, Integrys Energy Group and each of its subsidiaries were in compliance with all respective covenants related to outstanding short term and long term debt and expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 11, "Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit," for more information on Integrys Energy Groups credit facilities and other short term credit agreements, including short term debt covenants. See Note 12, "Long Term Debt," for more information on Integrys Energy Groups long term debt and related covenants. Other Future Considerations Decoupling In certain jurisdictions, decoupling mechanisms have been implemented, which allow utilities to adjust rates going forward to recover or refund all or a portion of the differences between the actual and authorized margin per customer impact of variations in volumes. The mechanisms do not adjust for changes in volume resulting from changes in customer count. Decoupling for residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the ICC on a four year trial basis for PGL and NSG, effective March 1, 2008. Interveners, including the Illinois Attorney General, oppose decoupling and have appealed the ICCs approval. PGL and NSG actively support the ICCs decision to approve decoupling. Included in their February 15, 2011 rate case filing, PGL and NSG requested that decoupling be ap proved on a permanent basis. The PSCW approved the implementation of decoupling on a four year trial basis, effective January 1, 2009, for WPSs natural gas and electric residential and small commercial sales. This decoupling mechanism includes an annual $14.0 million cap for electric service and an annual $8.0 million cap for natural gas service. Decoupling for UPPCO was approved for all customer groups by the MPSC, effective January 1, 2010. The MPSC granted an order, effective January 1, 2010, approving a decoupling mechanism for MGU as a pilot program which adjusts for the impact on revenues of changes in weather normalized use per customer for residential and small commercial customers, but does not adjust for weather related usage. In Minnesota, MERC proposed a decoupling mechanism in its November 30, 2010 general rate case filing. See Note 24, "Regulatory Environment," for more information. 54 Impairment Testing Integrys Energy Group performs its required annual goodwill impairment tests each April 1. Interim impairment tests are performed between required annual testing dates when impairment indicators are present. Any annual or interim goodwill impairment test could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss. See Note 9, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," for more information on goodwill balances for Integrys Energy Groups reporting units at December 31, 2010. See "Critical Accounting Policies, Goodwill Impairment," for more information on the 2010 annual goodwill impairment test. Integrys Energy Group also performs regular asset impairment tests related to other long lived assets, including the portfolio of merchant power plants owned and operated by Integrys Energy Services. See Note 5, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," for more information on Integrys Energy Groups impairment losses recorded during 2010. Climate Change The EPA began regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA in January 2011, by applying the BACT requirements associated with the New Source Review program to new and modified larger greenhouse gas emitters. Technology to remove and sequester greenhouse gas emissions is not commercially available at scale; hence, the EPA issued guidance that defines BACT in terms of improvements in energy efficiency as opposed to relying on pollution control equipment. In December 2010, the EPA announced its intent to develop new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and modified, as well as existing, electric utility steam generating units. The EPA plans to propose standards in 2011 and finalize standards in 2012. Efforts have been initiated to develop state and regional greenho use gas programs, to create federal legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and to create national or state renewable portfolio standards. Currently there is no applicable federal or state legislation pending that specifically addresses greenhouse gas emissions. A risk exists that such legislation or regulation will increase the cost of energy. However, Integrys Energy Group believes the capital expenditures being made at its generation units are appropriate under any reasonable mandatory greenhouse gas program and that future expenditures related to control of greenhouse gas emissions or renewable portfolio standards by its regulated electric utilities will be recoverable in rates. Integrys Energy Group will continue to monitor and manage potential risks and opportunities associated with future greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory actions. The majority of Integrys Energy Groups generation and distribution facilities are located in the upper Midwest region of the United States. The same is true for the majority of its customers facilities. The physical risks posed by climate change for these areas are not expected to be significant at this time. Ongoing evaluations will be conducted as more information on the extent of such physical changes becomes available. Property Tax Assessment on Natural Gas Integrys Energy Groups natural gas retailers, including its five natural gas utilities, purchase storage services from pipeline companies on the pipelines interstate natural gas storage and transmission systems. Once a shipper, such as the subsidiaries of Integrys Energy Group, delivers natural gas to the pipelines system, that specific natural gas cannot be physically traced back to the shipper, and the physical location of that specific natural gas is not ascertainable. Some states tax natural gas as personal property and have recently sought to assess personal property tax obligations against natural gas quantities held as working natural gas in facilities located in their states. Because the pipeline does not have title to the working natural gas inventory in these facilities, the state imposes the tax on the shippers as of the assessment date, based on allocated quantities. Shippers that are being assessed a tax are actively protesting these property tax assessments. PGL and MERC are currently pursuing protests through litigation in Texas and Kansas, respectively. 55 Federal Health Care Reform In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCR) were signed into law. HCR contains various provisions that will affect the cost of providing health care coverage to active and retired employees of Integrys Energy Group and their dependents. Although these provisions become effective at various times over the next 10 years, some provisions that affect the cost of providing benefits to retirees were reflected in 2010. Most notably, there is a provision of HCR that, beginning in 2013, eliminates the tax deduction for employer paid postretirement prescription drug charges to the extent those charges will be offset by the receipt of a federal Medicare Part D subsidy. As a result, Integrys Energy Group was required to eliminate a portion of its deferred tax asset related to postretirement benefits. The total amount of the deferred tax asset that was reduced for the loss of the deduction was $11.8 million, of which $10.8 million flowed through to net income as a component of income tax expense, and $1.0 million was deferred for regulatory recovery at UPPCO. Integrys Energy Group is seeking recovery in rates for the income impacts of this tax law change related to regulated utility operations in the majority of its juris dictions. If recovery in rates becomes probable, income tax expense would be reduced in that period, but at this time Integrys Energy Group is not able to predict how much will ultimately be recovered in rates. Other provisions of HCR include the elimination of certain annual and lifetime maximum benefits, broadening of plan eligibility requirements, elimination of pre existing condition restrictions, an excise tax on high cost health plans, changes to the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, and numerous other changes. Integrys Energy Group began participation in the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program that became effective on June 1, 2010. Integrys Energy Group continues to assess the extent to which the provisions of the new law will affect its future health care and related employee benefit plan costs. Wisconsin Fuel Rules Assembly Bill (AB) 600 was signed into law on May 18, 2010. AB 600 streamlines the current fuel rule administered by the PSCW. The current rule results in regulatory lag and hampers the ability of the PSCW to respond to rapid changes in fuel costs. AB 600 provides that the utility will defer any change in approved fuel costs in excess of a percentage set by the PSCW. The new rules will apply to WPSs 2011 fuel costs. Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act) The Dodd Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. Although a few provisions were effective with the passing of the act, the majority of the rules to implement the provisions will be finalized and become effective over the 18 months following the signing of the act. Depending on the final rules, certain provisions of the Dodd Frank Act relating to derivatives could increase capital and or collateral requirements. Final rules for these provisions are expected in the second quarter of 2011. Integrys Energy Group is monitoring developments related to this act and their impacts on its future results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Recent Tax Law Changes In January 2011, the Taxpayer Accountability and Budget Stabilization Act was enacted in Illinois. This act increases the corporate combined income tax rate from 7.3% to 9.5% retroactively to January 1, 2011. Rates decrease to 7.75% after 2014 and return to 7.3% after 2024. Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries will have to adjust deferred taxes to reflect the changes in the tax rate, effective in the first quarter of 2011. Due to the effects of regulation, and the timing of the February 2011 rate filings for PGL and NSG, Integrys Energy Group does not anticipate a material impact on income from this legislation. In December 2010, President Obama signed into law The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. This act includes tax incentives, such as an extension and increase of bonus depreciation, the extension of the research and experimentation credit, and the 56 extension of treasury grants in lieu of claiming the investment tax credit for certain renewable energy investments. In September 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. This act includes tax incentives, such as an extension to bonus depreciation and changes to listed property, that affect Integrys Energy Group. Integrys Energy Group anticipates that these tax law changes will likely result in $140.0 million to $240.0 million of reduced cash payments for taxes during 2011 and 2012. These incentives may also have the effect of reducing utility rate base and, thus, future earnings relative to prior expectations. Integrys Energy Group is evaluating the most appropriate manner to deploy the additional cash, which may include, among other things, mak ing incremental contributions to its various employee benefit plans or funding additional capital investments. Illinois Manufactured Gas Plant Legislation Senate Bill (SB) 3388 would require PGL and NSG either to enter into 30 year purchase contracts for manufactured gas produced from an Illinois coal and petroleum coke plant to be built on the south side of Chicago or to elect to file biennial rate proceedings before the ICC in 2011, 2013, and 2015. The stated mission of this coal to gas project is to use Illinois coal and petroleum coke to mass produce manufactured gas and sell its entire offput to the four largest Illinois natural gas utilities in equal amounts. Under certain assumptions, the Illinois Power Authority may allocate the offput based on therms sold by these utilities, but no utility would be required to take more than 42% of the total plant offput. SB 1927 is similar legislation for a manufactured gas project to be located in Jefferson County, Illinois.&#16 0; It would require PGL and NSG either to enter into 10 year purchase contracts, with the offput of the project allocated among the four largest Illinois natural gas utilities based on therms sold, or agree to biennial rate filings for 2011, 2013, and 2015. Both bills were passed by the General Assembly and were sent to the Governor for signature in January 2011. The Governor has 60 days to act. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS See Note 16, "Guarantees," for information regarding guarantees. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Integrys Energy Group has determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of its financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. Integrys Energy Groups management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Risk Management Activities Integrys Energy Group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. All derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, which provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts. Changes in fair value, except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral, generally affect net income (loss) attributed to common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled. At December 31, 2010, those derivatives not designated as hedges were primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities. Cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when Integrys Energy Group enters into contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases. In addition, Integrys Energy Group uses cash flow hedge accounting to protect against changes in interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting may be used when Integrys Energy Group holds assets, liabilities, or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates. To the extent that the hedging ins trument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged, there is no impact on net income (loss) attributed to common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge. 57 Integrys Energy Group has based its valuations on observable inputs whenever possible. However, at times, the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs. These valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management assets on Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets, $58.8 million (18.0%) were classified as Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management liabilities, $38.1 million (9.8%) were classified as Level 3 measurements. Integrys Energy Group believes these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date; however, the actual amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets. As a component of fair value determinations, Integrys Energy Group considers counterparty credit risk (including its own credit risk) and liquidity risk. The liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available. Changes in the underlying assumptions for the credit and liquidity risk components of fair value at December 31, 2010, would have had the following effects: Change in Risk Components Effect on Fair Value of Net Risk Management Liabilities at December 31, 2010 (Millions) 100% increase $6.0 decrease 50% decrease $3.0 increase These hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as part of nonregulated revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income, unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, in which case potential changes would be included in Other Comprehensive Income Cash Flow Hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholders Equity to the extent they are considered effective for offsetting future cash flows of the related hedged transactions. Goodwill Impairment Integrys Energy Group reviews goodwill for impairment as required by GAAP. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit. A reporting unit can be an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, as defined by the Segment Reporting Topic of the FASB ASC. At Integrys Energy Group, goodwill has been assigned to each of the five reporting units that comprise the natural gas utility segment and also to the Integrys Energy Services segment. The carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit and reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 was: (Millions) Carrying Value of Goodwill WPS $ 36.4 PGL 401.2 NSG 36.1 MERC 127.7 MGU 34.5 Total Natural Gas Utility Segment $ 635.9 Integrys Energy Services 6.6 Balance at December 31, 2010 $ 642.5 The goodwill for each of the reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 1 or more frequently when events or circumstances warrant. The fair market value of each reporting unit is estimated using certain key assumptions that require significant judgment. This judgment includes developing cash flow 58 projections (including the selection of appropriate returns on equity, long term growth rates, and capital expenditure levels), selecting appropriate discount rates, and identifying relevant market comparables. 2010 Impairment Test Integrys Energy Group completed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all of its reporting units that carry a goodwill balance as of April 1, 2010. The estimated fair value for the PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU reporting units was determined by using an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach methodologies. The income approach was based on discounted cash flows which were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations. Key assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach included the cash flow period, terminal values based on a terminal growth rate, and the discount rate. The discount rate represents the estimated cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a companys target capital structure. The discount rates used in the income approach for PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU ranged from 6.75% to 7.0%. The discount rate used for Integrys Energy Services was 10.2%. The terminal growth rates used in the income approach ranged from 2% to 3%. The market approach for PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU utilized the guideline company method, which calculates valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from publicly traded guideline companies in the regulated natural gas distribution industry. Multiples derived from the guideline companies provided an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for an investment in a similar company. These multiples were then applied to the appropriate operating metric for PGL, NSG, MERC, and MGU to determine indications of fair value. No impairment was recorded in 2010 as a result of these tests. However, the fair value calculated in the first step of the test for MGU approximated the carrying value of this reporting unit. Therefore, any deterioration of the market related factors used in the impairment analysis could potentially result in a future impairment loss for all or a portion of the $34.5 million of goodwill recorded at MGU. The fair value of the WPS natural gas utility reporting unit currently exceeds the carrying amount by a significant amount, such that Integrys Energy Group believes WPS is unlikely to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test in the foreseeable future. Receivables The regulated natural gas and electric utilities and Integrys Energy Services accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services rendered but not yet billed. Estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of factors based on customer class or contracted rates. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Integrys Energy Groups unbilled revenues were $339.1 million and $337.0 million, respectively. Any difference between actual revenues and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period. Differences historically have not been significant. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, described in Note 17, "Employee Benefit Plans," are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs. 59 Integrys Energy Groups pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. Management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at the regulated segments through the ratemaking process. The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percentage Point Change in Assumption Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation Impact on 2010 Pension Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 86.1 $ 7.5 Discount rate 0.5 (79.1 ) (7.1 ) Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 5.4 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (5.4 ) The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and the reported net periodic other postretirement benefit cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percentage Point Change in Assumption Impact on Postretirement Benefit Obligation Impact on 2010 Postretirement Benefit Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 34.0 $ 2.4 Discount rate 0.5 (30.9 ) (2.0 ) Health care cost trend rate (1.0 ) (56.6 ) (8.1 ) Health care cost trend rate 1.0 68.2 9.1 Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 1.1 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (1.1 ) The discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of non callable (or callable with make whole provisions), non collateralized, high quality corporate bonds with maturities between 0 and 30 years. The bonds are generally rated "Aa" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50 million. From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans expected future benefit payments. Integrys Energy Group establishes its expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long term rate of return was 8.5% in 2010, 2009, and 2008. For 2010, 2009, and 2008, the actual rates of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, were 13.0%, 22.0%, and (25.9)%, respectively. The determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. Cumulative gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the pension or other postretirement benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages. Changes in fair value are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans sponsored by WPS, while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for pension plans sponsored by IBS and PEC. Because of this method, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value. In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future 60 payments that Integrys Energy Group expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 17, "Employee Benefit Plans." Regulatory Accounting The electric and natural gas utility segments of Integrys Energy Group follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC, and the financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by Integrys Energy Groups regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by c onsidering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings at the electric and natural gas utility segments, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the rate recovery period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income. The application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of Integrys Energy Groups electric and natural gas utility segments operations would no longer meet the criteria for application. Assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet, but rather classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write off of all of Integrys Energy Groups regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2010, would result in a 16.4% decrease in total assets and a 5.7% decrease in total liabilities. The two largest regulatory assets at December 31, 2010, related to environmental remediation costs and unrecognized pensi on and other postretirement benefit costs. A write off of the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs at December 31, 2010, would result in a 6.7% decrease in total assets. A write off of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit related regulatory asset at December 31, 2010, would result in a 5.5% decrease in total assets. See Note 7, "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities," for more information. Tax Provision Integrys Energy Group is required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of the process of preparing Integrys Energy Groups consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within Integrys Energy Groups Consolidated Balance Sheets. Integrys Energy Group must also assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent Integrys Energy Group believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance, which is o ffset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Changes in the unrecognized tax benefits are estimated based on an evaluation of the degree of uncertainty, the nature of an event that could cause a change, and an estimate of the range of reasonably possible changes. Significant management judgment is required in determining Integrys Energy Groups provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and technical interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations 61 across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on Integrys Energy Groups financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(p), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes," and Note 14, "Income Taxes," for a discussion of accounting for income taxes. IMPACT OF INFLATION Integrys Energy Groups financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The statements provide a reasonable, objective, and quantifiable statement of financial results, but generally do not evaluate the impact of inflation. For Integrys Energy Groups regulated operations, to the extent it is not recovering the effects of inflation, it will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Integrys Energy Groups nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs. 62 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks and Other Significant Risks Integrys Energy Group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk (including regulatory recovery risk), interest rate risk, and equity return and principal preservation risk. Integrys Energy Group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of its subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which it operates. Integrys Energy Group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures, as further described below. Commodity Price Risk and Regulatory Recovery Risk Utilities The electric utilities of Integrys Energy Group purchase coal, natural gas, and fuel oil for use in power generation. They also buy power from the MISO market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation. Prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by UPPCO, and by the wholesale electric operations and Michigan retail electric operations of WPS. The costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utilities are also generally recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms. These recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities. WPSs Wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations. Instead, a "fuel window" mechanism partially mitigates the year to year price risk. See Note 1(f), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue and Customer Receivables," for more information. To manage commodity price risk, the regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and electricity. In addition, the electric operations of WPS and UPPCO, and the natural gas operations of WPS, PGL, NSG, and MERC employ risk management techniques, which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps, futures, and options. Integrys Energy Services Integrys Energy Services seeks to reduce market price risk from its generation and energy supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments. Additionally, Integrys Energy Services uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements. To measure commodity price risk exposure, Integrys Energy Group employs a number of controls and processes, including a value at risk (VaR) analysis of its exposures. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its open commodity positions (primarily natural gas and power positions). The VaR calculation excludes the positions created by owning energy assets and associated coal, sulfur dioxide emission allowances, renewable energy credits, and other ancillary fuels. Additionally, financial transmission rights, certain electric ancillary services, and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the VaR calculation. The capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions wo uld result in a VaR that would not be representative of the actual exposure. Therefore, Integrys Energy Services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions, which is either the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract. VaR is a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors, within a 63 given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period. In addition to VaR, Integrys Energy Services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations, stress testing, and scenario based testing. In conjunction with the VaR analysis, these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for Integrys Energy Services risk exposure. VaR is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. VaR has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results. Most importantly, VaR does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio. Price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported VaR. Large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions. Also, the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions. Short term reductions in market liquidity could cause Integrys Energy Services to hold positions open longer than anticipated, resulting in greater than predicted lo sses. Additionally, there are other risks not captured by the VaR metric including, but not limited to, the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which Integrys Energy Services transacts. Customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses, realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts, or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of counterparties are not met. Market liquidity risk refers to the risk that Integrys Energy Services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions. Integrys Energy Services VaR is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a 95% confidence level, as well as a ten day holding period and a 99% confidence level. The delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods, such as one day or ten days, are normally distributed. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options, as well as natural gas inventory, natural gas storage, and transportation contracts, to the extent such positions are significant, but excludes the positions mentioned above. The VaR for Integrys Energy Services portfolio at a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table: (Millions) 2010 2009 As of December 31 $ 0.2 $ 0.6 Average for 12 months ended December 31 0.3 0.8 High for 12 months ended December 31 0.3 1.1 Low for 12 months ended December 31 0.2 0.6 The VaR for Integrys Energy Services portfolio at a 99% confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented in the following table: (Millions) 2010 2009 As of December 31 $ 1.1 $ 2.9 Average for 12 months ended December 31 1.4 3.8 High for 12 months ended December 31 1.5 4.7 Low for 12 months ended December 31 1.1 2.9 The average, high, and low amounts were computed using the VaR amounts at each of the four quarter ends. The year over year decrease in VaR was driven primarily by reduced business size, as a result of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. 64 Interest Rate Risk Integrys Energy Group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. Integrys Energy Group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so. Integrys Energy Group may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. Due to decreases in short term borrowings in 2010, Integrys Energy Group has decreased its exposure to variable interest rates. Based on the variable rate debt of Integrys Energy Group outstanding at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased annual interest expense by $1.4 million. Comparatively, based on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2009, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased annual interest expense by $3.5 million. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period. Equity Return and Principal Preservation Risk Integrys Energy Group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds. The trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments primarily in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. Declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and require contributions into the plans. Integrys Energy Group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices. Most of the employee benefit costs relate to Integrys Energy Groups regulated utilities. As such, the majority of these costs are rec overed in customers rates, mitigating most of the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures. Also, the likelihood of an increase in the employee benefit obligations, which the investments must fund, has been partially mitigated as a result of certain employee groups no longer being eligible to participate in, or accumulate benefits in, certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Specifically, effective January 1, 2008, the defined benefit pension plans were closed to all Integrys Energy Group non union new hires. Effective May 1, 2008, and July 1, 2008, the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new union hires at PGL and NSG, respectively. Effective April 19, 2009, and December 18, 2009, the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new union hires at UPPCO and WPS, respectively. Effective January 15, 2010, the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new Local 12295 union hi res at MGU. 65
