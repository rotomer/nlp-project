ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION We are a diversified energy holding company with regulated natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), nonregulated energy operations, and an approximate 34% equity ownership interest in ATC (a federally regulated electric transmission company operating in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois). Strategic Overview Our goal is to create long term value for shareholders and customers through growth in our core regulated businesses. We also have a nonregulated energy services business segment that is focused on growth within a controlled risk profile. The essential components of our business strategy are: Maintaining and Growing a Strong Regulated Utility Base A strong regulated utility base is essential to maintaining a strong balance sheet, predictable cash flows, the desired risk profile, attractive dividends, and quality credit ratings. This is critical to our success as a strategically focused regulated business. We believe the following projects have helped, or will help, maintain and grow our regulated utility base and meet our customers needs: An accelerated annual investment in natural gas distribution facilities (primarily replacement of cast iron mains) at PGL. WPSs continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators. Capital projects to construct and or upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year. Our approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC, a transmission company that had over $3.0 billion of transmission assets at December 31, 2011. ATC plans to invest approximately $3.8 billion to $4.4 billion during the next ten years. Although ATCs equity requirements to fund its capital investments will primarily be met by earnings reinvestment, we plan to continue to fund our share of the equity portion of future ATC growth as necessary. For more detailed information on our capital expenditure program, see Liquidity and Capital Resources, Capital Requirements. Continuing Emphasis on Safe, Reliable, Competitively Priced, and Environmentally Sound Energy and Related Services Our mission is to provide customers with the best value in energy and related services. Ensuring continued reliability for our customers, we strive to effectively operate a mixed portfolio of generation assets and invest in new generation and natural gas distribution assets, while maintaining or exceeding environmental standards. This allows us to provide a safe, reliable, value priced service to our customers. We concentrate our efforts on improving and operating efficiently in order to reduce costs and maintain a low risk profile. We actively evaluate opportunities for adding more renewable generation to provide additional environmentally sound energy to our portfolio. Our recent entry into the compressed natural gas fueling marketplace, while not currently significant, is complementary to our existing businesses and is consistent with our mission. Operating a Nonregulated Energy Services Business Segment with a Controlled Risk and Capital Profile Through our nonregulated Integrys Energy Services subsidiary, we provide retail natural gas and electric products to end use customers in the northeast quadrant of the United States. In addition, Integrys Energy Services continues to develop, acquire, own and operate renewable energy projects, primarily distributed solar generation, in the United States. We have repositioned this subsidiary from a focus on significant growth in wholesale and retail electric markets across the United States and Canada, to a focus on operating within select retail electric and natural gas markets in our current market footprint where we have experience and believe we will have the most success growing our recurring customer based business. The current strategy is intended to result in more dependable cash and earnings contributions with a controlled risk and capital profile. Integrating Resources to Provide Operational Excellence We are committed to integrating resources of all our businesses, while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and lowering costs. Operational Excellence initiatives are implemented to encourage top performance in the areas of project management, process improvement, contract administration, and compliance in order to reduce costs and manage projects and activities within appropriate budgets, schedules, and regulations. Placing Strong Emphasis on Asset and Risk Management Our asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of existing assets, the acquisition of assets, and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement our existing business and strategy. The goal is to provide the most efficient use of resources while maximizing return and maintaining an acceptable risk profile. This strategy focuses on acquiring assets consistent with strategic plans and disposing of assets, including property, plant, and equipment and entire business units, that 22 Table of Contents are no longer strategic to ongoing operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. We maintain a portfolio approach to risk and earnings. Our risk management strategy includes the management of market, credit, liquidity, and operational risks through the normal course of business. Forward purchases and sales of electric capacity, energy, natural gas, and other commodities and the use of derivative financial instruments, including commodity swaps and options, provide opportunities to reduce the risk associated with price movement in a volatile energy market. Each business unit manages the risk profile related to these instruments consistent with our risk management policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Risk Management Group, which reports through the Chief Financial Officer, provides corporate oversight. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Year Ended December 31 Change in Change in (Millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 2011 Over 2010 2010 Over 2009 Natural gas utility operations $ 103.3 $ 84.0 $ (172.1 ) 23.0 % N/A Electric utility operations 100.5 109.8 88.9 (8.5 )% 23.5 % Electric transmission investment 47.8 46.2 45.5 3.5 % 1.5 % Integrys Energy Services operations (6.1 ) 3.3 3.8 N/A (13.2 )% Holding company and other operations (18.1 ) (22.4 ) (35.7 ) (19.2 )% (37.3 )% Net income (loss) attributed to common shareholders $ 227.4 $ 220.9 $ (69.6 ) 2.9 % N/A Basic earnings (loss) per share $ 2.89 $ 2.85 $ (0.91 ) 1.4 % N/A Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 2.87 $ 2.83 $ (0.91 ) 1.4 % N/A Average shares of common stock Basic 78.6 77.5 76.8 1.4 % 0.9 % Diluted 79.1 78.0 76.8 1.4 % 1.6 % 2011 Compared with 2010 Our earnings for 2011 were $227.4 million, compared with $220.9 million for 2010. The $6.5 million increase in earnings was driven by: The $31.8 million after tax decreases in impairment losses recorded on generation plants and losses on dispositions at Integrys Energy Services. An additional $20.3 million after tax net decrease in operating expenses across all segments, driven by a decrease in employee benefit costs and lower depreciation and amortization expense. The $15.0 million positive year over year impact of tax adjustments recorded in 2011 and 2010 in connection with the federal health care reform. A $14.4 million after tax increase in Integrys Energy Services realized margins. These increases were partially offset by: A $66.1 million after tax decrease in Integrys Energy Services margins from non cash derivative and inventory fair value adjustments. An $8.4 million after tax decrease in electric utility margins, mainly caused by differences in WPSs 2011 electric rate order compared with the previous rate order. 2010 Compared with 2009 We recognized net income attributed to common shareholders of $220.9 million in 2010 compared with a net loss attributed to common shareholders of $69.6 million in 2009. The primary driver of the $290.5 million increase in earnings was an after tax noncash goodwill impairment loss of $248.8 million recorded in 2009, compared with no goodwill impairment losses in 2010. Other factors contributing to the increase were the combined approximate $69 million after tax positive impact on margins of electric and natural gas distribution rate increases effective in 2010, and a $22.5 million after tax reduction in restructuring expenses year over year. These increases in earnings were partially offset by after tax impairment charges of $25.9 million in 2010 related to three natural gas fired generation plants at Integrys Energy Services. 23 Table of Contents Regulated Natural Gas Utility Segment Operations Year Ended December 31 Change in Change in (Millions, except degree days) 2011 2010 2009 2011 Over 2010 2010 Over 2009 Revenues $ 1,998.0 $ 2,057.2 $ 2,237.5 (2.9 )% (8.1 )% Purchased natural gas costs 1,101.4 1,152.0 1,382.0 (4.4 )% (16.6 )% Margins 896.6 905.2 855.5 (1.0 )% 5.8 % Operating and maintenance expense 523.6 542.1 532.6 (3.4 )% 1.8 % Goodwill impairment loss 291.1 N/A (100.0 )% Restructuring expense (0.2 ) 6.9 (100.0 )% N/A Depreciation and amortization expense 126.1 130.9 106.1 (3.7 )% 23.4 % Taxes other than income taxes 35.6 34.4 33.4 3.5 % 3.0 % Operating income (loss) 211.3 198.0 (114.6 ) 6.7 % N/A Miscellaneous income 2.2 1.6 3.1 37.5 % (48.4 )% Interest expense (48.4 ) (49.7 ) (52.2 ) (2.6 )% (4.8 )% Other expense (46.2 ) (48.1 ) (49.1 ) (4.0 )% (2.0 )% Income (loss) before taxes $ 165.1 $ 149.9 $ (163.7 ) 10.1 % N/A Retail throughput in therms Residential 1,541.5 1,496.4 1,602.8 3.0 % (6.6 )% Commercial and industrial 469.5 455.5 501.4 3.1 % (9.2 )% Other 61.3 53.7 60.8 14.2 % (11.7 )% Total retail throughput in therms 2,072.3 2,005.6 2,165.0 3.3 % (7.4 )% Transport throughput in therms Residential 237.4 224.4 237.7 5.8 % (5.6 )% Commercial and industrial 1,559.7 1,504.0 1,403.9 3.7 % 7.1 % Total transport throughput in therms 1,797.1 1,728.4 1,641.6 4.0 % 5.3 % Total throughput in therms 3,869.4 3,734.0 3,806.6 3.6 % (1.9 )% Weather Average heating degree days 6,675 6,440 7,061 3.6 % (8.8 )% 2011 Compared with 2010 Margins Natural gas utility margins are defined as natural gas utility operating revenues less purchased natural gas costs. Management believes that natural gas utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating natural gas utility operations than natural gas revenues since we pass through prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs to our customers in current rates. There was an approximate 7% decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold during 2011, which had no impact on margins. Regulated natural gas utility segment margins decreased $8.6 million. The decrease in margins was driven by the approximate $19 million negative year over year impact at PGL and NSG of higher regulatory refunds and lower regulatory recoveries that are offset by equal decreases in operating and maintenance expense, resulting in no impact on earnings. We refunded approximately $13 million more to customers under bad debt riders in 2011. We also recovered approximately $6 million less for environmental cleanup costs at our former manufactured gas plant sites in 2011. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the PGL and NSG bad debt riders and Note 16, Commitment and Contingencies, for more information on our manufactured gas plant sites. 24 Table of Contents The decrease in margins was partially offset by: An approximate $4 million net increase in margins as a result of a 3.6% increase in volumes sold. Higher sales volumes excluding the impact of weather resulted in approximately $17 million of additional margins. We attribute this increase to a combination of higher use per customer, higher average customer counts, and improved economic conditions for certain customers. Colder weather during 2011, as shown by the 3.6% increase in heating degree days, drove an approximate $6 million increase in margins. Partially offsetting these increases was an approximate $19 million decrease due to decoupling mechanisms at certain natural gas utilities. Although decoupling was implemented to minimize the impact of changes in sales volumes, it does not cover all jurisdictions or customers. During 2011, decoupling lessened the positive impact from some of the increased sales volumes through higher future customer refunds. During 2010, decoupling lessened the negative impact from some of the decreased sales volumes through higher future customer recoveries. An approximate $4 million net increase in margins from rate orders. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on these rate orders. MERCs conservation improvement program (CIP) rate increase, effective November 1, 2010, and its interim natural gas distribution rate increase, effective February 1, 2011, had a combined approximate $13 million positive impact on margin. The CIP margins of approximately $7 million did not impact earnings as they were offset by an increase in operating and maintenance expense. The rate increases at PGL and NSG, effective January 28, 2010, and other impacts of rate design, had an approximate $7 million net positive impact on margins. The rate decrease at WPS, effective January 14, 2011, resulted in an approximate $16 million negative impact on margins. An approximate $2 million increase in margins due to a year over year positive impact from the 2010 amortization of a regulatory asset at WPS related to energy efficiency legislation implemented in a prior year. An approximate $2 million increase in margins due to a rider approved through September 30, 2011 for recovery of AMRP costs at PGL. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on this rider. Operating Income Operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased $13.3 million. This increase was primarily driven by a $21.9 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by the $8.6 million decrease in margins discussed above. The decrease in operating expenses primarily related to: An approximate $19 million decrease due to higher amortization of regulatory liabilities related to bad debt riders and lower amortization of regulatory assets related to environmental cleanup costs for manufactured gas plant sites, all at PGL and NSG. Margins decreased by an equal amount, resulting in no impact on earnings. A $4.8 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. WPS received approval for lower depreciation rates from the PSCW, effective January 1, 2011. The decrease also reflects the impact of a $2.5 million write off of certain MGU assets in 2010, which is currently pending appeal before the Michigan Court of Appeals. A $7.8 million decrease in employee benefits expense, partially driven by lower employee health care costs. A $3.6 million decrease in customer accounts expense resulting from lower customer call volumes and a decrease in labor associated with fewer disconnections. A $2.6 million decrease in asset usage charges from IBS related to retirement of certain computer hardware. 25 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: A $10.0 million increase in natural gas distribution costs. The increase was partially due to additional labor related to distribution operations activities and additional consulting costs associated with a work asset management system and the AMRP. Transportation costs, building maintenance, meter maintenance projects, and other miscellaneous distribution costs also contributed to the increase. A $5.0 million increase in expenses related to energy conservation and efficiency programs. This net increase includes expenses related to the CIP that were recovered through the MERC rate increase discussed in margins above. Other Expense Other expense decreased $1.9 million, driven by a decrease in interest expense on long term debt. PGL refinanced some of its long term debt at lower interest rates in the second half of 2010. In addition, WPS did not replace certain senior notes that matured in the third quarter of 2011. 2010 Compared with 2009 Margins Natural gas utility margins are defined as natural gas utility operating revenues less purchased natural gas costs. Management believes that natural gas utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating natural gas utility operations than natural gas revenues since we pass through prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs to our customers in current rates. There was an approximate 9% decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold during 2010, which had no impact on margins. Regulated natural gas utility segment margins increased $49.7 million, driven by the approximate $96 million positive impact of rate increases. These rate increases were necessary, in part, to recover higher operating expenses (as discussed below). See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on these rate increases. The rate increases at PGL and NSG had an approximate $77 million positive impact on margins. The rate increase at WPS and MGU had an approximate $13 million and $3 million positive impact on margins, respectively. A rate increase at MERC related to its CIP had an approximate $3 million positive impact on margins. CIP margins are offset by a corresponding increase in operating and maintenance expense and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. This increase in margins was partially offset by: An approximate $28 million decrease in margins resulting from the 1.9% lower volumes sold, related to: An approximate $19 million decrease related to warmer weather during 2010, as evidenced by the 8.8% decrease in heating degree days. An approximate $19 million decrease related to lower sales volumes excluding the impact of weather. Residential customer sales volumes decreased, which we attribute to energy conservation, efficiency efforts, and general economic conditions. This decrease was partially offset by a net increase in commercial and industrial sales volumes for both retail and transportation customers, driven by certain transportation customers of MERC and MGU. Partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate $10 million increase in 2010 due to decoupling mechanisms in place at certain of our regulated natural gas utilities. Under decoupling, certain of our regulated natural gas utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction. The decoupling mechanism for WPSs natural gas utility includes an annual $8.0 million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin. This cap was reached in the first quarter of 2010 but was not reached in 2009. An approximate $18 million net decrease in margins driven by lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at our former manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by an increase in margins related to recoveries received under the PGL and NSG bad debt riders. These amounts were offset by an equal net decrease in operating and maintenance expense resulting from lower net amortization of the related regulatory assets and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. Recoveries under these riders represent net billings to customers of the excess or deficiency of actual 2008 and 2009 bad debt expense over bad debt expense reflected in utility rates during those same periods. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the PGL and NSG bad debt riders. 26 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased $312.6 million. This increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of a $291.1 million noncash goodwill impairment loss that was recorded in the first quarter of 2009. Also contributing to the increase was the $49.7 million increase in the natural gas margins discussed above, partially offset by a $28.2 million increase in other operating expenses. See Note 10, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for information related to the goodwill impairment loss recorded in 2009. The increase in other operating expenses primarily related to: A $24.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to the ICCs rate order for PGL and NSG, effective January 28, 2010. This rate order allows earlier recovery in rates for net dismantling costs by including them as a component of depreciation rates applied to natural gas distribution assets. The increase also reflects the impact of a $2.5 million write off of certain MGU assets, which is currently pending appeal before the Michigan Court of Appeals. A $12.9 million increase in expenses related to energy conservation programs and enhanced efficiency initiatives. This increase includes expenses related to the CIP that were recovered through the MERC rate increase discussed in margins above. A $14.7 million increase in employee benefit costs, primarily driven by an increase in other postretirement benefit costs. A $7.4 million increase in asset usage charges from IBS related to implementation of both a work asset management system for natural gas operations and an upgrade to an enterprise resource planning system for finance and supply chain services. These increases were partially offset by: An approximate $18 million net decrease due to approximately $25 million of lower amortization of the regulatory asset related to environmental cleanup expenditures for manufactured gas plant sites, partially offset by approximately $7 million of amortization related to the regulatory assets recorded as a result of the PGL and NSG bad debt riders. This net decrease was passed through to customers in rates and, therefore, had no impact on earnings. A $7.1 million decrease in restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, Restructuring Expense, for more information. A $6.1 million decrease in labor costs as a result of the reduction in workforce and company wide furloughs implemented as a part of previously announced cost management efforts. 27 Table of Contents Regulated Electric Utility Segment Operations Year Ended December 31 Change in Change in (Millions, except degree days) 2011 2010 2009 2011 Over 2010 2010 Over 2009 Revenues $ 1,307.3 $ 1,338.9 $ 1,301.6 (2.4 )% 2.9 % Fuel and purchased power costs 546.3 563.9 584.5 (3.1 )% (3.5 )% Margins 761.0 775.0 717.1 (1.8 )% 8.1 % Operating and maintenance expense 421.5 417.2 392.0 1.0 % 6.4 % Restructuring expense 0.2 (0.3 ) 8.6 N/A N/A Depreciation and amortization expense 88.5 94.7 90.3 (6.5 )% 4.9 % Taxes other than income taxes 47.6 45.6 46.6 4.4 % (2.1 )% Operating income 203.2 217.8 179.6 (6.7 )% 21.3 % Miscellaneous income 0.8 1.5 4.8 (46.7 )% (68.8 )% Interest expense (41.8 ) (43.9 ) (41.6 ) (4.8 )% 5.5 % Other expense (41.0 ) (42.4 ) (36.8 ) (3.3 )% 15.2 % Income before taxes $ 162.2 $ 175.4 $ 142.8 (7.5 )% 22.8 % Sales in kilowatt hours Residential 3,135.6 3,114.3 3,043.0 0.7 % 2.3 % Commercial and industrial 8,520.9 8,439.6 8,155.5 1.0 % 3.5 % Wholesale 4,256.8 4,994.7 5,079.1 (14.8 )% (1.7 )% Other 38.4 39.1 40.0 (1.8 )% (2.3 )% Total sales in kilowatt hours 15,951.7 16,587.7 16,317.6 (3.8 )% 1.7 % Weather WPS: Heating degree days 7,524 7,080 7,962 6.3 % (11.1 )% Cooling degree days 603 616 274 (2.1 )% 124.8 % Weather UPPCO: Heating degree days 8,676 8,002 9,317 8.4 % (14.1 )% Cooling degree days 305 301 99 1.3 % 204.0 % 2011 Compared with 2010 Margins Electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Management believes that electric utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues. To the extent changes in fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers, the changes are offset by comparable changes in operating revenues. Any significant changes in fuel and purchased power costs that are not recovered from customers are explained in the margin discussion below. Regulated electric utility segment margins decreased $14.0 million, driven by: An approximate $18 million decrease in retail margins due to differences between the 2011 WPS rate order and the previous rate order. Although the 2011 rate order included a lower authorized return on common equity, lower rate base, and other reduced costs, which resulted in lower total revenues and margins, the rate order also projected lower total sales volumes, which led to a rate increase on a per unit basis. The 2011 rate increase, calculated on a per unit basis, was more than offset by the decoupling mechanism due to changes in the rate order that impact the decoupling calculation. For more details on the WPS 2011 rate order, see Note 26, Regulatory Environment. An approximate $5 million decrease in margins from wholesale customers. The decrease was due to lower sales volumes and lower non fuel revenue requirements driven by a lower return on common equity, lower rate base, and other reduced costs. These decreases were partially offset by: An approximate $6 million increase in margins driven by a retail electric rate increase at UPPCO. 28 Table of Contents An approximate $3 million increase in margins due to a year over year positive impact from the 2010 amortization of a regulatory asset at WPS related to energy efficiency legislation implemented in a prior year. Operating Income Operating income at the regulated electric utility segment decreased $14.6 million, driven by the $14.0 million decrease in margins and a $0.6 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily related to: A $4.9 million increase in the amortization of various regulatory deferrals. This increase was offset in revenues, resulting in no impact on earnings. A $3.6 million increase in customer assistance expense related to payments made to the Focus on Energy program. The program promotes residential and small business energy efficiency and renewable energy products. A $2.0 million increase in taxes other than income taxes, driven by increases in gross receipts taxes and property taxes. A $1.9 million increase in electric transmission expense. A $1.8 million increase in injuries and damages expenses. These increases were substantially offset by: A $7.7 million decrease in employee benefit costs. The decrease was partially due to lower pension expense driven by an increase in contributions, which increased plan assets. A $6.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. The PSCW approved lower depreciation rates effective January 1, 2011, and we had lower software amortization in 2011. Other Expense Other expense decreased $1.4 million, driven by a decrease in interest expense due to the maturity and repayment of $150 million of long term debt at WPS in August 2011. 2010 Compared with 2009 Margins Electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Management believes that electric margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating electric utility operations than electric operating revenues. To the extent changes in fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers, the changes are offset by comparable changes in operating revenues. Any significant changes in fuel and purchased power costs that are not recovered from customers are explained in the margin discussion below. Regulated electric utility segment margins increased $57.9 million, driven by: An approximate $26 million increase in margins driven by lower fuel and purchased power costs incurred during 2010 as compared with authorized fuel and purchased power cost recovery rates. An approximate $21 million combined positive impact of retail electric rate increases at both WPS and UPPCO, effective January 1, 2010. An approximate $7 million increase in margins due to a 2.7% increase in sales volumes to residential customers at WPS, primarily related to warmer year over year weather during the cooling season, as evidenced by the increase in cooling degree days. Margins were impacted by the year over year increase in sales volumes because WPS reached the annual $14.0 million electric decoupling cap in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 and remained over the cap through the end of both years. Therefore, no additional decoupling deferral was allowed for additional shortfalls from authorized margin for the remainder of both years. Under decoupling, WPS is allowed to defer (up to the established cap) the difference between its actual margin and the rate case authorized margin recognized from residential and small commercial and industrial customers. 29 Table of Contents An approximate $7 million increase in margins due to a 7.5% increase in sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers at WPS, primarily related to changes in the business operations of these customers year over year. These increases in regulated electric utility segment margins were partially offset by an approximate $2 million decrease in margins from WPSs wholesale customers, primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes. Operating Income Operating income at the regulated electric utility segment increased $38.2 million, driven by the $57.9 million increase in margins, partially offset by a $19.7 million increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was the result of: A $13.9 million increase in electric transmission expense. A $12.7 million increase in customer assistance expense related to payments made to the Focus on Energy program. The program promotes residential and small business energy efficiency and renewable energy products. A $7.5 million increase in employee benefit costs. The increase was partially due to an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, driven by the amortization of negative investment returns on plan assets from prior years. A $4.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to the Crane Creek Wind Farm being placed in service for accounting purposes in December 2009. These increases were partially offset by: An $8.9 million year over year decrease in restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce. See Note 3, Restructuring Expense, for more information. A $6.2 million decrease in labor costs, driven by the reduction in workforce and company wide furloughs implemented as part of previously announced cost management efforts. A $2.1 million decrease in electric maintenance expense at WPS, primarily related to a greater number of planned outages at its generation plants during 2009 compared with 2010. Other Expense Other expense at the regulated electric utility segment increased $5.6 million, driven by a decrease in AFUDC, primarily related to the construction of the Crane Creek Wind Farm in 2009. Electric Transmission Investment Segment Operations 2011 Compared with 2010 Miscellaneous Income Miscellaneous income at the electric transmission investment segment increased $1.5 million. The increase resulted from higher earnings related to our approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. We earn higher returns each year as ATC continues to increase its rate base by investing in transmission equipment and facilities for improved reliability and economic benefits. 2010 Compared with 2009 Miscellaneous Income Miscellaneous income at the electric transmission investment segment increased $2.3 million. The increase resulted from higher earnings related to our approximate 34% ownership interest in ATC. We earn higher returns each year as ATC continues to increase its rate base by investing in transmission equipment and facilities for improved reliability and economic benefits. 30 Table of Contents Integrys Energy Services Nonregulated Segment Operations Year Ended December 31 Change in 2011 Over Change in 2010 Over (Millions, except natural gas sales volumes) 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 Revenues $ 1,395.9 $ 1,823.7 $ 3,994.0 (23.5 )% (54.3 )% Cost of sales 1,272.7 1,614.3 3,696.1 (21.2 )% (56.3 )% Margins 123.2 209.4 297.9 (41.2 )% (29.7 )% Margin Detail Realized retail electric margins 98.5 85.4 (2)(4) 82.0 (4) 15.3 % 4.1 % Realized wholesale electric margins (0.2 )(1) (8.2 )(3) 40.3 (97.6 )% N/A Realized energy asset margins 31.1 34.5 37.9 (9.9 )% (9.0 )% Fair value accounting adjustments (30.7 ) 36.0 29.9 N/A 20.4 % Electric and other margins 98.7 147.7 190.1 (33.2 )% (22.3 )% Realized retail natural gas margins 49.1 50.0 (4) 68.7 (4) (1.8 )% (27.2 )% Realized wholesale natural gas margins 3.9 (1) (3.3 ) 40.8 N/A N/A Lower of cost or market inventory adjustments (10.7 ) 6.8 155.4 N/A (95.6 )% Fair value accounting adjustments (17.8 ) 8.2 (157.1 ) N/A N/A Natural gas margins 24.5 61.7 107.8 (60.3 )% (42.8 )% Operating and maintenance expense 108.8 117.6 188.6 (7.5 )% (37.6 )% Impairment losses on property, plant, and equipment 4.6 43.2 0.7 (89.4 )% 6,071.4 % Restructuring expense 1.8 8.3 27.2 (78.3 )% (69.5 )% Net (gain) loss on Integrys Energy Services dispositions related to strategy change (0.3 ) 14.1 28.9 N/A (51.2 )% Depreciation and amortization 12.7 17.2 19.0 (26.2 )% (9.5 )% Taxes other than income taxes 7.0 5.0 7.4 40.0 % (32.4 )% Operating income (loss) (11.4 ) 4.0 26.1 N/A (84.7 )% Miscellaneous income 0.4 9.1 6.0 (95.6 )% 51.7 % Interest expense (2.3 ) (6.7 ) (13.1 ) (65.7 )% (48.9 )% Other income (expense) (1.9 ) 2.4 (7.1 ) N/A N/A Income (loss) before taxes $ (13.3 ) $ 6.4 $ 19.0 N/A (66.3 )% Physically settled volumes Retail electric sales volumes in kwh 12,416.5 12,647.9 (6) 15,045.3 (6) (1.8 )% (15.9 )% Wholesale electric sales volumes in kwh 320.1 (5) 1,319.9 3,965.2 (75.7 )% (66.7 )% Retail natural gas sales volumes in bcf 125.5 133.3 (6) 236.7 (6) (5.9 )% (43.7 )% Wholesale natural gas sales volumes in bcf 27.5 402.5 (100.0 )% (93.2 )% kwh kilowatt hours bcf billion cubic feet (1) Realized wholesale activity relates to remaining contracts for which offsetting positions were entered into.

The significant items contributing to the change in margins were as follows: Electric and Other Margins Realized retail electric margins Realized retail electric margins increased $13.1 million. Higher margins in the markets that Integrys Energy Services continues to focus on drove the increase. Most of these markets had higher sales volumes and positive results from the change in pricing and customer mix that was implemented as part of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. The $1.4 million negative impact on margins in 2010 from the settlement of supply contracts also contributed to the year over year increase. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in margins related to the sale of the Texas retail electric business in June 2010, resulting from Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Fair value accounting adjustments Derivative accounting rules impact Integrys Energy Services margins. Fair value adjustments caused a $66.7 million decrease in electric margins year over year. These adjustments primarily relate to physical and financial contracts used to reduce price risk for supply associated with electric sales contracts. These adjustments will reverse in future periods as contracts settle. Natural Gas Margins Realized retail natural gas margins Realized retail natural gas margins decreased $0.9 million. In 2011 there were fewer opportunities to take advantage of natural gas price volatility and changes in market prices for natural gas storage and transportation capacity. Inventory accounting adjustments Integrys Energy Services physical natural gas inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. When the market price of natural gas is lower than the carrying value of the inventory, write downs are recorded within margins to reflect inventory at the end of the period at its net realizable value. These write downs result in higher margins in future periods as the inventory that was written down is sold. The $17.5 million year over year decrease in margins from inventory adjustments was driven by an increase in write downs and lower volume of inventory withdrawn from storage for which write downs had previously been recorded. Fair value accounting adjustments Derivative accounting rules impact Integrys Energy Services margins. Fair value adjustments caused a $26.0 million decrease in natural gas margins year over year. These adjustments primarily relate to physical and financial contracts used to reduce price risk for supply, storage, and transportation associated with natural gas sales contracts. These adjustments will reverse in future periods as contracts settle. Operating Income (Loss) Integrys Energy Services operating income decreased $15.4 million, driven by the $86.2 million decrease in margins discussed above, partially offset by a $70.8 million decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in operating expense was primarily related to: A $38.6 million decrease in impairment losses recorded on generation plants. A $14.4 million decrease due to losses on Integrys Energy Services dispositions in 2010 related to its strategy change. A $6.5 million decrease in restructuring expense. A $4.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, driven by lower book value of the generation plants for which impairment losses were recorded in 2010. 32 Table of Contents A $4.7 million decrease in employee payroll and benefit related expenses, primarily due to the reduction in workforce associated with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. A $2.2 million decrease in intercompany fees related to a credit agreement with the holding company. Other Income (Expense) Integrys Energy Services other income decreased $4.3 million. The main driver for the decrease was an $8.7 million decrease in miscellaneous income. This decrease was driven by the negative year over year impact of a $4.3 million gain reclassified from accumulated OCI in 2010 related to foreign currency translation adjustments, and a $3.4 million decrease in interest income driven by the holding companys repayment of borrowings from Integrys Energy Services in the first quarter of 2011. The decrease in miscellaneous income was partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in interest expense driven by reduced business size as a result of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. 2010 Compared with 2009 Revenues Revenues decreased $2,170.3 million during 2010, compared with 2009, as a result of our decision to reduce the scale, scope, and risk attributes of Integrys Energy Services by focusing on selected retail electric and natural gas markets in the United States and investments in energy assets with renewable attributes. See Note 5, Dispositions, for a discussion of the dispositions completed in connection with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Also contributing to the decrease in revenues were lower energy prices, as the average market price of natural gas and electricity decreased approximately 7% and 4% respectively, year over year. Margins Integrys Energy Services margins decreased $88.5 million during 2010, compared with 2009. The significant items contributing to the change in margins were as follows: Electric and Other Margins Realized retail electric margins Realized retail electric margins increased $3.4 million during 2010, compared with 2009, driven by: A $9.2 million increase in margins in the Illinois market, primarily driven by a change in pricing methodology and customer mix that was implemented as part of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. A $5.5 million increase in margins in the Michigan market. This increase was driven by higher sales volumes due to increased marketing efforts. The above increases in realized retail electric margins were partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in margins related to the sale of the Texas retail electric business in June 2010, driven by reduced sales volumes and a $1.4 million decrease related to the settlement of supply contracts. See Note 5, Dispositions, for a discussion of this sale. Realized wholesale electric margins Realized wholesale electric margins decreased $48.5 million year over year, including negative margins of $9.3 million in 2010 related to the settlement of wholesale supply contracts in connection with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Wholesale transactions and structured origination activity were significantly scaled back in conjunction with Integrys Energy Services sale of substantially all of its United States wholesale electric marketing and trading business, which was completed in February 2010. See Note 5, Dispositions, for more information on Integrys Energy Services sale of its United States wholesale electric marketing and trading business. Fair value accounting adjustments Derivative accounting rules impact Integrys Energy Services margins. Fair value adjustments caused a $6.1 million increase in electric margins year over year. These adjustments primarily relate to physical and financial contracts used to reduce price risk for supply associated with electric sales contracts. 33 Table of Contents Natural Gas Margins Realized retail natural gas margins Realized retail natural gas margins decreased $18.7 million during 2010, compared with 2009, driven by: A $7.6 million decrease driven by reduced sales volumes due to the sale of Integrys Energy Services Canadian retail natural gas portfolio in September 2009. See Note 5, Dispositions, for a discussion of this sale. A $7.5 million decrease in margins in the Illinois market, primarily due to the negative year over year impact of the withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas from storage in the first half of 2009, resulting in higher realized margins during that period. Also contributing to the decrease were lower sales volumes resulting from Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Realized wholesale natural gas margins Realized wholesale natural gas margins decreased $44.1 million year over year due to Integrys Energy Services completing the sale of substantially all of its wholesale natural gas business in December 2009. Additional components of the wholesale natural gas business were sold in March 2010 and May 2010. The remaining realized wholesale natural gas activity at Integrys Energy Services is related to residual contracts that will settle in the first half of 2011. The risks associated with these residual contracts are economically hedged. See Note 5, Dispositions, for more information on Integrys Energy Services sale of its wholesale natural gas business. Inventory accounting adjustments Integrys Energy Services physical natural gas inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. When the market price of natural gas is lower than the carrying value of the inventory, write downs are recorded within margins to reflect inventory at the end of the period at its net realizable value. These write downs result in higher margins in future periods as the inventory that was written down is sold. The $148.6 million year over year decrease in margins from inventory adjustments was driven by a lower volume of inventory withdrawn from storage in 2010 for which write downs had previously been recorded. Fair value accounting adjustments Derivative accounting rules impact Integrys Energy Services margins. Fair value adjustments caused a $165.3 million increase in natural gas margins year over year. These adjustments primarily relate to physical and financial contracts used to reduce price risk for supply, storage, and transportation associated with natural gas sales contracts. Operating Income (Loss) Integrys Energy Services operating income decreased $22.1 million year over year, driven by the $88.5 million decrease in margins discussed above, and a $43.2 million noncash impairment loss related to three natural gas fired generation plants in the third quarter of 2010. These decreases were partially offset by a $71.0 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense, an $18.9 million decrease in restructuring expense, and a $14.8 million decrease in the net loss on Integrys Energy Services dispositions related to its strategy change (which primarily resulted from mark to market timing differences that have historically caused earnings volatility at Integrys Energy Services). The decrease in operating and maintenance expense was driven by: A $46.0 million year over year decrease in employee payroll and benefit related expenses, primarily due to the reduction in workforce associated with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. A $10.5 million year over year decrease in bad debt expense driven by the partial recovery in 2010 of receivables fully reserved in prior years, and a decrease in reserves resulting from reduced business activity. The $9.0 million positive year over year impact of a fee incurred in the second quarter of 2009 related to an agreement with a counterparty that enabled Integrys Energy Services to reduce collateral support requirements. An $8.0 million year over year decrease in broker commissions, contractor expenses, and various other fees, resulting from reduced business activity associated with Integrys Energy Services strategy change. The above decreases in operating and maintenance expense were partially offset by $8.1 million of intercompany fees related to a credit agreement established in 2010 with the holding company. 34 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Integrys Energy Services other income increased $9.5 million year over year, driven by a $4.3 million gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income in 2010 related to foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in prior periods, as well as a $6.4 million decrease in interest expense driven by reduced business size, as a result of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Holding Company and Other Segment Operations Change in Change in Year Ended December 31 2011 Over 2010 Over (Millions) 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 Operating income (loss) $ 5.7 $ 8.3 $ (1.9 ) (31.3 )% N/A Other expense (34.0 ) (45.9 ) (58.1 ) (25.9 )% (21.0 )% Net loss before taxes $ (28.3 ) $ (37.6 ) $ (60.0 ) (24.7 )% (37.3 )% 2011 Compared with 2010 Operating Income Operating income at the holding company and other segment decreased $2.6 million. The decrease was driven primarily by lower intercompany fees charged by the holding company to Integrys Energy Services related to lower interest charges and decreased use of an intercompany credit agreement. Other Expense Other expense at the holding company and other segment decreased $11.9 million. Interest expense on long term debt decreased, driven by both lower interest rates on debt refinanced and lower average outstanding long term debt in 2011. 2010 Compared with 2009 Operating Income (Loss) Operating income at the holding company and other segment increased $10.2 million, driven by $8.1 million of intercompany fees charged by the holding company to Integrys Energy Services related to a credit agreement established in 2010. Other Expense Other expense at the holding company and other segment decreased $12.2 million, driven by a $14.6 million decrease in external interest expense. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Effective Tax Rate 36.7 % 39.9 % 624.6 % 2011 Compared with 2010 Our effective tax rate decreased during 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we reduced the provision for income taxes by $5.8 million when we recorded a regulatory asset related to deferred income taxes previously expensed as part of the 2010 federal health care reform. We were authorized recovery of these income taxes through our recently approved rate order for PGL and NSG. As discussed below, we expensed $10.8 million of deferred income taxes as a result of the federal health care reform in 2010. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Future Considerations Federal Health Care Reform for more information. The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2011 was partially offset when we increased our provision for income taxes and deferred income tax liabilities by $6.0 million for tax law changes in Michigan and Wisconsin. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Future Considerations Recent Tax Law Changes for more information. 35 Table of Contents For information on changes in the deferred income tax balances, see Note 15, Income Taxes. 2010 Compared with 2009 Our effective tax rate decreased during 2010. The rate decreased primarily because a significant portion of our $291.1 million noncash pre tax goodwill impairment loss recorded in 2009 was not deductible for tax purposes. Partially offsetting this decrease in the effective tax rate was the 2010 federal health care reform. This legislation eliminated the tax deduction for retiree prescription drug payments that are paid by employers and are offset by the receipt of a federal Medicare Part D subsidy. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Future Considerations Federal Health Care Reform for more information. As a result, we expensed $10.8 million of deferred income taxes during 2010. This amount excluded $1.0 million for which UPPCO was authorized recovery from ratepayers. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 2011 Compared with 2010 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $0.6 million in 2011. During 2011, we remeasured an unrecognized tax benefit liability related to the 2007 sale of Peoples Energy Production Company, including an adjustment for a lapse in the statute of limitations for certain states associated with these tax filings. 2010 Compared with 2009 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased $2.6 million in 2010. During 2009, Integrys Energy Services recognized a $3.9 million ($2.4 million after tax) gain on the sale of its energy management consulting business in discontinued operations. During 2010, Integrys Energy Services recorded a $0.2 million after tax gain in discontinued operations when contingent payments were earned related to the sale of this business. For more information on the discontinued operations discussed above, see Note 5, Dispositions, and Note 27, Segments of Business. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We believe we have adequate resources to fund ongoing operations and future capital expenditures. These resources include our cash balances, liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to equity and debt capital markets, and available borrowing capacity. Our borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies, as well as the market rates for interest. Our operating cash flows and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control. Operating Cash Flows 2011 Compared with 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities was $721.9 million during 2011, compared with $725.2 million during 2010. The $3.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by: Net cash used for working capital of $34.2 million in 2011, compared with $40.8 million of net cash provided by working capital in 2010. The $75.0 million year over year increase in working capital requirements was primarily due to: A $17.3 million increase in cash collateral provided to counterparties in 2011, compared with a $163.6 million decrease in cash collateral provided in 2010, primarily due to the change in Integrys Energy Services business related to its strategy change. Inventory levels increased $28.0 million in 2011, compared to a decrease of $51.1 million in 2010. The increase in inventory in 2011 was driven by warmer weather at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010, which impacted inventory levels at PGL and NSG, and increased coal freight costs at WPS. The decrease in inventory in 2010 was largely due to the impact of the Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Partially offsetting these changes was the positive impact from a $46.2 million decrease in other current assets in 2011, compared with an $85.5 million increase in other current assets in 2010. This change was driven by the year over year increase in net cash received for income taxes, which was primarily due to the 100% bonus tax depreciation allowed in 2011. Also partially offsetting these changes was a $68.4 million year over year positive impact from the change in other current liabilities. The change was driven by the return of collateral to counterparties in 2010 as a result of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. 36 Table of Contents The net increase in working capital requirements was partially offset by a $70.3 million net decrease in contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 2010 Compared with 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities was $725.2 million during 2010, compared with $1,606.3 million during 2009. The $881.1 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by: A $746.5 million net decrease in cash provided by working capital, driven by: A $767.2 million year over year decrease in cash generated from customer collections, primarily due to the Integrys Energy Services strategy change, as well as lower year over year natural gas prices, which impacted both the regulated natural gas segment and Integrys Energy Services. A $393.0 million year over year decrease in cash generated from reduced inventory levels, mainly the result of the withdrawal of a significant amount of natural gas from storage at Integrys Energy Services during 2009 in order to improve its liquidity position. Partially offsetting these changes was a $578.9 million year over year decrease in cash used to pay accounts payable balances, driven by smaller accounts payable balances at Integrys Energy Services as a result of the strategy change, as well as lower year over year natural gas prices. Also offsetting these changes was a year over year increase in cash flows of $118.1 million due to a decrease in cash collateral provided to counterparties, due primarily to the change in Integrys Energy Services business related to its strategy change. A $175.8 million year over year increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits, primarily driven by a change in tax accounting related to capitalization of overhead costs and legislation providing for bonus depreciation during 2010. A $148.5 million year over year increase in contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Investing Cash Flows 2011 Compared with 2010 Net cash used for investing activities was $394.8 million during 2011, compared with $199.7 million during 2010. The $195.1 million increase in net cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by: A $58.4 million decrease in proceeds received from the sale or disposal of assets. The proceeds received in 2010 primarily related to the Integrys Energy Services strategy change. A $52.6 million increase in cash used to fund capital expenditures (discussed below). In 2011, $42.6 million of net cash was used for the acquisition of the Pinnacle and Trillium compressed natural gas fueling businesses. A $30.7 million year over year increase in capital contributions to equity method investments, mainly due to increased contributions to INDU Solar Holdings, LLC. 2010 Compared with 2009 Net cash used for investing activities was $199.7 million during 2010, compared with $440.7 million during 2009. The $241.0 million decrease in net cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by: A $185.4 million decrease in cash used to fund capital expenditures (discussed below). A $27.2 million year over year decrease in capital contributions to equity method investments, mainly related to ATC capital contributions. A year over year increase in proceeds received from the sale or disposal of assets, primarily related to Integrys Energy Services strategy change. For more information on these dispositions, see Note 5, Dispositions. 37 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Reportable Segment (millions) 2011 2010 2009 Electric utility $ 84.1 $ 87.2 $ 250.4 Natural gas utility 199.3 133.6 136.9 Integrys Energy Services 18.0 15.2 22.4 Holding company and other 10.0 22.8 34.5 Integrys Energy Group consolidated $ 311.4 $ 258.8 $ 444.2 The increase in capital expenditures at the natural gas utility segment in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily a result of the AMRP at PGL. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in capital expenditures at the holding company and other segment, primarily due to lower software project expenditures in 2011. The decrease in capital expenditures at the electric utility segment in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to decreased expenditures related to the Crane Creek Wind Farm project, which was placed in service for accounting purposes in December 2009. The decrease in capital expenditures at the holding company and other segment was mainly due to lower expenditures in 2010 related to software projects. Financing Cash Flows 2011 Compared with 2010 Net cash used for financing activities was $478.4 million during 2011, compared with $391.4 million during 2010. The $87.0 million increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by: A $648.6 million increase due to $515.8 million of net repayments of long term debt in 2011, compared with $132.8 million of net long term issuances in 2010. A $28.3 million decrease in cash provided by the issuance of common stock. See Significant Financing Activities for more information. A $20.3 million increase in cash used for the payment of common stock dividends. A $15.4 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of borrowed natural gas related to the strategy change at Integrys Energy Services. Partially offsetting these increases in net cash used were: A $505.4 million decrease due to $293.3 million of net borrowings of short term debt and notes payable in 2011, compared with $212.1 million of net repayments in 2010. A $125.9 million decrease in payments related to the divestitures of the nonregulated wholesale electric and natural gas businesses. In 2010, $27.8 million was paid to the buyers upon the sale of these businesses. No such payments were made in 2011. The remaining $98.1 million decrease related to the settlement of certain contracts that were executed at the time of sale. 2010 Compared with 2009 Net cash used for financing activities was $391.4 million during 2010, compared with $1,378.4 million during 2009. The $987.0 million year over year decrease in net cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by: A $761.5 million year over year decrease in the net repayment of short term borrowings. A $298.6 million decrease due to net natural gas loan proceeds at Integrys Energy Services of $15.4 million during 2010, compared with the net repayment of $283.2 million of natural gas loans during 2009. 38 Table of Contents Partially offsetting these changes were $157.8 million of payments made during 2010 to buyers of the wholesale natural gas and electric businesses and payments for settlement of out of the money transactions that were executed at the time of sale, compared with $33.9 million of proceeds received upon the sale of substantially all of the wholesale natural gas business during 2009. The out of the money transactions were replacement supply trades for the retained retail operations and were transacted at the original transfer price between Integrys Energy Services wholesale and retail businesses. Payments made to the buyers to settle the replacement supply contracts were funded with proceeds received from the settlement of the related retail electric and retail natural gas sales contracts. Significant Financing Activities Our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share in 2011 remained the same as in 2010. From January 1, 2010 through February 10, 2010, shares were purchased on the open market to meet the requirements of our Stock Investment Plan and certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans. From February 11, 2010 through April 30, 2011, we issued new shares of common stock to meet the requirements of these plans. Beginning May 1, 2011, shares were again purchased on the open market to meet the requirements of these plans. We had $303.3 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2011, and none outstanding at December 31, 2010. We had no short term notes payable outstanding at December 31, 2011, and $10.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2010. We had no borrowings under revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2011, and 2010. See Note 12, Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information. For information on the issuance and redemption of our long term debt and that of our subsidiaries, see Note 13, Long Term Debt. We use internally generated funds, commercial paper borrowings, and other short term borrowings to satisfy most of our capital requirements. We also periodically issue long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. We have our own commercial paper borrowing programs, as do WPS and PGL. WPS periodically issues long term debt to reduce short term debt, fund future growth, and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the PSCW. PGL and NSG periodically issue long term debt in order to reduce short term debt, refinance maturing securities, maintain desired capitalization ratios, and fund future growth. The specific forms of long term financing, amounts, and timing depend on business needs, market conditions, and other factors. 39 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our current credit ratings and the credit ratings for WPS, PGL, and NSG are listed in the table below: Credit Ratings Standard & Poors Moodys Integrys Energy Group Issuer credit rating A N/A Senior unsecured debt BBB+ Baa1 Commercial paper A 2 P 2 Credit facility N/A Baa1 Junior subordinated notes BBB Baa2 WPS Issuer credit rating A A2 First mortgage bonds N/A Aa3 Senior secured debt A Aa3 Preferred stock BBB Baa1 Commercial paper A 2 P 1 Credit facility N/A A2 PGL Issuer credit rating A A3 Senior secured debt A A1 Commercial paper A 2 P 2 NSG Issuer credit rating A A3 Senior secured debt A A1 Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. They are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. On January 24, 2012, Standard & Poors raised the issuer credit ratings for us, PGL, and NSG to A from BBB+. In addition, they raised our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB+ from BBB and raised our junior subordinated notes rating to BBB from BBB . The outlook for us, PGL, and NSG was revised to stable from positive. According to Standard & Poors, the revised ratings reflect their view that our business risk profile improved to excellent from strong and that we continue to have a significant financial risk profile. The revised business risk profile assessment reflects the successful implementation of our strategic initiative to reduce our exposure to the nonutility businesses and our effective management of regulatory risk. WPSs outlook remained stable. On May 27, 2010, Moodys revised the outlook for us and all of our subsidiaries to stable from negative. According to Moodys, the revised outlook reflected a reduced business risk profile driven by the recently completed restructuring of Integrys Energy Services into a smaller segment with significantly reduced collateral requirements. Moodys also raised the following ratings of our subsidiaries: The senior secured debt rating and first mortgage bonds rating of WPS were raised from A1 to Aa3. The senior secured debt ratings of PGL and NSG were raised from A2 to A1. According to Moodys, the upgrade follows the August 2009 upgrade of the senior secured ratings of the majority of its investment grade regulated utilities (issuers with negative outlooks were excluded from the August 2009 upgrade). 40 Table of Contents Future Capital Requirements and Resources Contractual Obligations The following table shows our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, including those of our subsidiaries. Payments Due By Period (Millions) Total Amounts Committed 2012 2013 to 2014 2015 to 2016 2017 and Thereafter Long term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 2,975.2 $ 358.1 $ 581.0 $ 633.9 $ 1,402.2 Operating lease obligations 81.6 8.5 13.8 8.1 51.2 Commodity purchase obligations (2) 2,669.0 700.5 707.7 345.6 915.2 Capital contributions to equity method investment 3.4 3.4 Purchase orders (3) 418.2 416.8 1.4 Pension and other postretirement funding obligations (4) 820.6 289.5 201.1 60.0 270.0 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,968.0 $ 1,776.8 $ 1,505.0 $ 1,047.6 $ 2,638.6 (1) Represents bonds and notes issued, as well as loans made to us and our subsidiaries. We record all principal obligations on the balance sheet. For purposes of this table, it is assumed that the current interest rates on variable rate debt will remain in effect until the debt matures. (2) Energy and related commodity supply contracts at Integrys Energy Services included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy and related products to customers. The utility subsidiaries expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates. (3) Includes obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations. (4) Obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, other than the Integrys Energy Group Retirement Plan, cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2014. The table above does not reflect payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $613.7 million at December 31, 2011, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. We expect to incur costs annually to remediate these sites. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information about environmental liabilities. The table also does not reflect payments for the December 31, 2011, liability of $22.4 million related to unrecognized tax benefits, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. See Note 15, Income Taxes, for more information on unrecognized tax benefits. 41 Table of Contents Capital Requirements As of December 31, 2011, our subsidiaries capital expenditures for the three year period 2012 through 2014 were expected to be as follows: (Millions) WPS Environmental projects $ 510.7 Electric and natural gas distribution projects 201.1 Electric and natural gas delivery and customer service projects 63.7 Other projects 176.0 UPPCO Repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 16.6 Other projects 31.7 MGU Natural gas pipe distribution system, underground natural gas storage facilities, and other projects 34.8 MERC Natural gas pipe distribution system and other projects 53.2 PGL Natural gas pipe distribution system, underground natural gas storage facilities, and other projects 699.9 NSG Natural gas pipe distribution system and other projects 85.2 Integrys Energy Services Solar and other projects 98.6 IBS Corporate services infrastructure projects 96.2 ITF Compressed natural gas fueling stations 71.0 Total capital expenditures $ 2,138.7 We expect to provide capital contributions to INDU Solar Holdings, LLC, (not included in the above table) of approximately $45 million in 2012. INDU Solar Holdings was created in October 2010, through wholly owned subsidiaries of both Integrys Energy Services and Duke Energy Generation Services, to build and finance distributed solar projects throughout the United States. We expect to provide capital contributions to ATC (not included in the above table) of approximately $15 million from 2012 through 2014. All projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from the estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Capital Resources Management prioritizes the use of capital and debt capacity, determines cash management policies, uses risk management policies to hedge the impact of volatile commodity prices, and makes decisions regarding capital requirements in order to manage the liquidity and capital resource needs of the business segments. We plan to meet our capital requirements for the period 2012 through 2014 primarily through internally generated funds (net of forecasted dividend payments) and debt and equity financings. We plan to keep debt to equity ratios at levels that can support current credit ratings and corporate growth. We believe we have adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet our future needs. Under an existing shelf registration statement, we may issue debt, equity, certain types of hybrid securities, and other financial instruments with amounts, prices, and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. Under an existing shelf registration statement, WPS may issue up to $500.0 million of senior debt securities with amounts, prices, and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. 42 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, we and each of our subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short term and long term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 12, Short Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information on credit facilities and other short term credit agreements, including short term debt covenants. See Note 13, Long Term Debt, for more information on long term debt and related covenants. Various laws, regulations, and financial covenants impose restrictions on the ability of certain of our regulated utility subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of dividends. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are prohibited from loaning funds to us, either directly or indirectly. Although these restrictions limit the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to us, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on our ability to access cash for payment of dividends on common stock or other future funding obligations. See Note 20, Common Equity, for more information on dividend restrictions. Other Future Considerations Decoupling In certain jurisdictions, decoupling mechanisms have been implemented. These mechanisms differ state by state and allow utilities to adjust future rates to recover or refund all or a portion of the differences between actual and authorized margin. Decoupling for residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the ICC on a four year trial basis for PGL and NSG, effective March 1, 2008. Interveners, including the Illinois Attorney General, oppose decoupling and have appealed the ICCs approval. PGL and NSG actively support the ICCs decision to approve decoupling. In the PGL and NSG rate order approved on January 10, 2012, the ICC made the decoupling mechanism (based on total margin) permanent for both companies. The appeal of the original decoupling order is pending and, depending on the outcome, could impact the current rate order provision for decoupling. Decoupling for natural gas and electric residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the PSCW on a four year trial basis for WPS, effective January 1, 2009, and ending on December 31, 2012. The mechanism does not adjust for variations in volumes resulting from changes in customer count compared to rate case levels, nor does it cover all customer classes. This decoupling mechanism includes an annual $14.0 million cap for electric service and an annual $8.0 million cap for natural gas service. Amounts recoverable from or refundable to customers are subject to these caps and are included in rates upon approval in a rate order. WPS expects to address decoupling beyond 2012 in its rate case filing for 2013. Decoupling for UPPCO was approved for the majority of customer classes by the MPSC, effective January 1, 2010, and ended on December 31, 2011. A new weather normalized decoupling mechanism based on total margin will become effective for UPPCO on January 1, 2013. UPPCO has no decoupling mechanism in place for 2012. The MPSC granted an order, effective January 1, 2010, approving a decoupling mechanism for MGU that covers residential and small commercial and industrial customers. The decoupling mechanism does not adjust for weather related usage, nor does it adjust for variations in volumes resulting from changes in customer count compared to rate case levels. The decoupling mechanism does not cover all customer classes. In Minnesota, MERC proposed a decoupling mechanism in its November 30, 2010 general rate case filing. A final order is expected in the second quarter of 2012. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information. Climate Change The EPA began regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act in January 2011 by applying the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements (associated with the New Source Review program) to new and modified larger greenhouse gas emitters. Technology to remove and sequester greenhouse gas emissions is not commercially available at scale. Therefore, the EPA issued guidance that defines BACT in terms of improvements in energy efficiency as opposed to relying on pollution control equipment. In December 2010, the EPA announced its intent to develop new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions. The standards would apply to new and modified, as well as existing, electric utility steam generating units. The EPA planned to propose these standards in 2011 and finalize them in 2012; however, the proposal has since been delayed. 43 Table of Contents A risk exists that any greenhouse gas legislation or regulation will increase the cost of producing energy using fossil fuels. However, we believe the capital expenditures being made at our plants are appropriate under any reasonable mandatory greenhouse gas program. We also believe that future expenditures by our regulated electric and natural gas utilities that may be required to control greenhouse gas emissions or meet renewable portfolio standards will be recoverable in rates. We will continue to monitor and manage potential risks and opportunities associated with future greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory actions. The majority of our generation and distribution facilities are located in the upper Midwest region of the United States. The same is true for the majority of our customers facilities. The physical risks posed by climate change for these areas are not expected to be significant at this time. Ongoing evaluations will be conducted as more information on the extent of such physical changes becomes available. Property Tax Assessment on Natural Gas Our subsidiaries and natural gas retailers purchase storage services from pipeline companies on interstate systems. Some states tax natural gas held as working natural gas in facilities located within their jurisdiction as personal property. Shippers that are being assessed a tax are actively protesting these property tax assessments. MERC is currently pursuing a protest through litigation in Kansas. Federal Health Care Reform In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCR) were signed into law. HCR contains various provisions that will affect the cost of providing health care coverage to our active and retired employees and their dependents. Although these provisions become effective at various times over the next 10 years, some provisions that affect the cost of providing benefits to retirees were reflected in our financial statements in 2010 and 2011. Beginning in 2013, a provision of HCR will eliminate the tax deduction for employer paid postretirement prescription drug charges to the extent those charges will be offset by the receipt of a federal Medicare Part D subsidy. As a result, we eliminated $11.8 million of our deferred tax asset related to postretirement benefits in 2010. Of this amount, $10.8 million flowed through to net income as a component of income tax expense in 2010. The remaining $1.0 million was deferred for regulatory recovery at UPPCO. An additional $1.5 million was expensed in June 2011 for deferred income taxes related to a Wisconsin tax law change (see discussion in Recent Tax Law Changes below). In the fourth quarter of 2011, PGL and NSG recorded a regulatory asset of $5.8 million, reversing amounts previously expensed in 2010, as PGL and NSG were authorized recovery of these amounts in the rate order approved on January 10, 2012. In addition, WPS was authorized recovery in February 2012 for the portion related to its Michigan operations that was previously expensed in 2010. We expect to seek rate recovery for the remaining $5.9 million of income tax expense that relates to this tax law change associated with our regulated operations. If recovery in rates becomes probable in the remaining jurisdiction, income tax expense will be reduced in that period. We are not currently able to predict how much of the remaining portion, if any, will be recovered in rates. Other provisions of HCR include the elimination of certain annual and lifetime maximum benefits and the broadening of plan eligibility requirements. It also includes the elimination of pre existing condition restrictions, an excise tax on high cost health plans, changes to the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, and numerous other changes. We participate in the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program that became effective on June 1, 2010. We continue to assess the extent to which the provisions of the new law will affect our future health care and related employee benefit plan costs. Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act) The Dodd Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. However, significant rulings essential to its framework still remain outstanding. Depending on the final rules, certain provisions of the Dodd Frank Act relating to derivatives could increase capital and or collateral requirements. Final rules for these provisions are expected in the second quarter of 2012. We are monitoring developments related to this act and their impacts on our future financial results. Recent Tax Law Changes Federal In December 2010, President Obama signed into law The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. This act includes tax incentives, such as an extension and increase of bonus depreciation, the extension of the research and experimentation credit, and the extension of treasury grants in lieu of claiming the investment tax credit or production tax credit for certain renewable energy investments. In September 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. This act includes tax incentives, such as an extension to bonus depreciation and changes to listed property, that affect us. We anticipate that these tax law changes will likely result in $140.0 million to $240.0 million of reduced cash payments for taxes during 2012. These tax incentives may also reduce utility rate base and, 44 Table of Contents thus, future earnings relative to prior expectations. We have primarily used the proceeds from these incentives to make incremental contributions to our various employee benefit plans. In addition, these tax incentives have helped reduce our financing needs. In December 2011, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was enacted. The most significant provision of the NDAA was to retroactively eliminate the application of the tax normalization rule for cash grants taken by a regulated utility in lieu of the investment tax credit or production tax credits. Prior to the enactment of NDAA, a regulated utility would have been required to amortize the grant in rates over the regulatory life of the renewable energy generating plant. Further, the allowed rate of return on the generating plant could not be reduced by the unamortized grant balance during the life of the plant. As a result of the enactment of NDAA, we are evaluating our options for taking advantage of cash grants in lieu of the production tax credits we are currently claiming for WPSs Crane Creek wind project. Illinois In January 2011, Governor Quinn signed into law the Taxpayer Accountability and Budget Stabilization Act. This act increased the corporate combined income tax rate from 7.3% to 9.5% retroactive to January 1, 2011. The rate decreases to 7.75% after 2014 and returns to 7.3% after 2024. We adjusted deferred taxes to reflect the changes in the tax rate in the first quarter of 2011. Due to the effects of regulation, and the timing of the January 10, 2012 rate order for PGL and NSG, we do not expect a material impact on income from this legislation. Michigan In May 2011, Governor Snyder signed legislation that replaced Michigans business tax with a state income tax, effective January 1, 2012. In accounting for this tax law change, we expensed $4.4 million of deferred income taxes in 2011 primarily related to our nonregulated operations and our unitary filings. We deferred an additional $4.2 million in 2011 for recovery in future rates. Wisconsin In June 2011, Governor Walker signed into law a two year budget bill. Under the bill, the Wisconsin tax code was changed to conform to the federal tax code, retroactive to December 2010. In accounting for this tax law change, we expensed an additional $1.5 million of deferred income taxes in 2011 related to the Medicare Part D subsidy. The legislation also contains favorable provisions related to the carryforward of net operating losses prior to 2008. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS See Note 17, Guarantees, for information regarding guarantees. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Risk Management Activities We have entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. All derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheets, unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, which provides that recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts. Changes in fair value, except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral, generally affect net income attributed to common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled. At December 31, 2011, those derivatives not designated as hedges were primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities. Cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used to protect against changes in interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting may be used when we hold assets, liabilities, or firm commitments and enter into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates. To the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged, there is no impact on net income attributed to common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge. We have based our valuations on observable inputs whenever possible. However, at times, the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs. These valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management assets on our balance sheets, $14.9 million (5.1%) were classified as Level 3 measurements. Of the total risk management liabilities, $22.8 million (5.5%) were classified as Level 3 measurements. We believe these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date; however, the actual 45 Table of Contents amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets. As a component of fair value determinations, we consider counterparty credit risk, our own credit risk, and liquidity risk. The liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available. Changes in the underlying assumptions for the credit and liquidity risk components of fair value at December 31, 2011, would have had the following effects: Change in Risk Components Effect on Fair Value of Net Risk Management Liabilities at December 31, 2011 (Millions) 100% increase $ 5.0 decrease 50% decrease $ 2.5 increase These hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the balance sheets and as part of nonregulated revenues on the income statements. As of July 1, 2011, Integrys Energy Services discontinued the use of cash flow hedge accounting. See Note 2, Risk Management Activities for further discussion. Goodwill Impairment We completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carry a goodwill balance as of April 1, 2011. No impairment was recorded as a result of these tests. For all of our reporting units, the fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than the carrying value. The fair value was calculated using an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the fair value of a reporting unit. For the regulated reporting units, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair value of these reporting units to decrease. Key assumptions used in the income approach included return on equity for the regulated reporting units, long term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period, and discount rates. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair values will decrease. The discount rate is determined based on the weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit, taking into account both the after tax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year return on equity (ROE) for each utility is based on its current allowed ROE adjusted for forecasted disallowed costs and expectations regarding the direction and magnitude of movements in interest rates. The terminal growth rate is based on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area. We used the guideline company method for the market approach. This method uses metrics from similar publicly traded companies in the same industry to determine how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for an investment in a similar company. We applied multiples derived from these guideline companies to the appropriate operating metric for the utility reporting units to determine indications of fair value. The underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the test. The fair values of the WPS natural gas utility and Integrys Energy Services reporting units exceeded the carrying values by a substantial amount. Based on these results, these reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The fair values calculated in the first step of the test for MGU, MERC, PGL, and NSG exceeded the carrying values by approximately 6% to 17%. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, we cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairments. As a result, we performed a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions for these reporting units. The following table shows the change in each assumption, holding all other inputs constant, that would result in a fair value at or below carrying value, causing the applicable reporting unit to fail step one of the test: Change in key inputs (in basis points) MGU MERC PGL NSG Discount rate 75 150 175 450 Terminal year return on equity (195 ) (310 ) (487 ) (810 ) Terminal year growth rate (100 ) (225 ) N/A * N/A * 46 Table of Contents * Even with a terminal year growth rate of 0%, assuming all other inputs remained constant, these reporting units would still have passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Accrued Unbilled Revenues We accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services provided or energy delivered but not yet billed to customers. Estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of judgments and assumptions related to customer class or contracted rates. Significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our unbilled revenues were $282.1 million and $339.1 million, respectively. The amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors, including seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, commodity prices, and customer mix. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, described in Note 18, Employee Benefit Plans, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. We believe that such changes in costs would be recovered at the regulated segments through the ratemaking process. The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percentage Point Change in Assumption Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation Impact on 2011 Pension Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 102.0 $ 8.9 Discount rate 0.5 (93.7 ) (8.5 ) Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 6.1 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (6.1 ) The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and the reported net periodic other postretirement benefit cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. Actuarial Assumption (Millions, except percentages) Percentage Point Change in Assumption Impact on Postretirement Benefit Obligation Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Discount rate (0.5 ) $ 37.3 $ 2.7 Discount rate 0.5 (34.9 ) (2.2 ) Health care cost trend rate (1.0 ) (60.9 ) (8.4 ) Health care cost trend rate 1.0 73.7 10.9 Rate of return on plan assets (0.5 ) N/A 1.3 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (1.3 ) The discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of non callable (or callable with make whole provisions), non collateralized, high quality corporate bonds with maturities between 0 and 30 years. The bonds are generally rated Aa with a minimum amount outstanding of $50 million. From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans expected future benefit payments. We establish our expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long term rate of return was 8.25% in 2011, and 8.50% in 2010 and 2009. For 2011, 2010, and 2009, the actual rates of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, were 1.5%, 13.0%, and 22.0%, respectively. 47 Table of Contents The determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. Cumulative gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the pension or other postretirement benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages. Changes in realized and unrealized investment gains and losses are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans sponsored by WPS, while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for pension plans sponsored by IBS and PELLC. Because of this method, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value. In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 18, Employee Benefit Plans. Regulatory Accounting Our electric and natural gas utility segments follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured, and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings at the electric and natural gas utility segments, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. The application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our electric and natural gas utility segments operations no longer meet the criteria for application. Assets and liabilities recognized as a result of rate regulation would be written off as extraordinary items in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred. A write off of all our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2011, would result in a 17.9% decrease in total assets and a 5.7% decrease in total liabilities. The two largest regulatory assets at December 31, 2011, related to unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs and environmental remediation costs. A write off of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit related regulatory asset at December 31, 2011, would result in a 7.3% decrease in total assets. A write off of the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs at December 31, 2011, would result in a 6.3% decrease in total assets. See Note 8, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information. Income Tax Provision We are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the income statements. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(p), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes, and Note 15, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The statements provide a reasonable, objective, and quantifiable statement of financial results, but generally do not evaluate the impact of inflation. To the extent our regulated operations are not recovering the effects of inflation, they will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions in which they operate. Our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks and Other Significant Risks We have potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and equity return and principal preservation risk. We are also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which we operate. We have risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures, as further described below. Commodity Price Risk Utilities The electric utilities purchase coal, natural gas, and fuel oil for use in power generation. They also buy power from the MISO market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation. Prudent fuel and purchased power costs and capacity payments are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by UPPCO, and by the wholesale electric operations and Michigan retail electric operations of WPS. The costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utilities are also generally recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms. These recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities. WPSs Wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations. Instead, a fuel window mechanism substantially mitigates this price risk. To manage commodity price risk for their customers, the regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and electricity. In addition, the electric operations of WPS and UPPCO, and the natural gas operations of WPS, PGL, NSG, and MERC, employ risk management techniques, which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps, futures, and options. See Note 1(f), Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenues and Customer Receivables, for more information. Integrys Energy Services Integrys Energy Services seeks to reduce market price risk from its generation and energy supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments. Additionally, Integrys Energy Services uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements. To measure commodity price risk exposure, Integrys Energy Services employs a number of controls and processes, including a value at risk (VaR) analysis of its exposures. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation is used to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its open commodity positions (primarily natural gas and power positions). The VaR calculation excludes the positions created by owning energy assets and associated coal, sulfur dioxide emission allowances, renewable energy credits, and other ancillary fuels. Additionally, financial transmission rights, certain electric ancillary services, and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the VaR calculation. The capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions would result in a VaR that would not be representative of the actual exposure. Therefore, Integrys Energy Services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions, which is either the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract. VaR is a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk. The VaR amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors, within a given confidence level, if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period. In addition to VaR, Integrys Energy Services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations, stress testing, and scenario based testing. In conjunction with the VaR analysis, these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for Integrys Energy Services risk exposure. VaR is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. VaR has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results. Most importantly, VaR does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio. Price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported VaR. Large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions. Also, the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions. Short term reductions in market liquidity could cause Integrys Energy Services to hold positions open longer than anticipated, resulting in greater than predicted losses. Additionally, there are other risks not captured by the VaR metric including, but not limited to, the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which Integrys Energy Services transacts. Customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses, realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts, or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of counterparties are not met. Market liquidity risk refers to the risk that Integrys Energy Services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions. 49 Table of Contents Integrys Energy Services VaR is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a 95% confidence level, as well as a ten day holding period and a 99% confidence level. The delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods, such as one day or ten days, are normally distributed. Integrys Energy Services VaR calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options, as well as natural gas inventory, natural gas storage, and transportation contracts, to the extent such positions are significant, but excludes the positions mentioned above. The VaR for Integrys Energy Services portfolio at a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table: (Millions) 2011 2010 As of December 31 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 Average for 12 months ended December 31 0.2 0.3 High for 12 months ended December 31 0.3 0.3 Low for 12 months ended December 31 0.1 0.2 The VaR for Integrys Energy Services portfolio at a 99% confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented in the following table: (Millions) 2011 2010 As of December 31 $ 0.7 $ 1.1 Average for 12 months ended December 31 0.7 1.4 High for 12 months ended December 31 1.2 1.5 Low for 12 months ended December 31 0.5 1.1 The average, high, and low amounts were computed using the VaR amounts at each of the four quarter ends. The year over year decrease in VaR was driven primarily by reduced business size, as a result of Integrys Energy Services strategy change. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. We enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure. Due to short term borrowings, we are exposed to variable interest rates. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased annual interest expense by $3.3 million. Comparatively, based on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2010, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would have increased annual interest expense by $1.4 million. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period. Equity Return and Principal Preservation Risk We currently fund liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds. The trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments primarily in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. Declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and require additional contributions into the plans. We monitor the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices. Most of the employee benefit costs relate to the regulated utilities. As such, the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates, reducing most of the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures. Also, the likelihood of an increase in the employee benefit obligations, which the investments must fund, has been partially mitigated as a result of certain employee groups no longer being eligible to participate in, or accumulate benefits in, certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Our defined benefit pension plans are closed to all new hires. 50 Table of Contents
