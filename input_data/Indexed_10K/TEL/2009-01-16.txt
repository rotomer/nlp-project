ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Separation From Tyco International Ltd. Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company", which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "Separation"). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its subsidiaries as an independent, publicly traded entity subsequent to the Separation and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco Electronics Ltd., for periods prior to the Separation. Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to the Separation may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented. Certain general corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, and other expenses as well as debt and related net interest expense for periods prior to the Separation were allocated to us by Tyco International. 35 Management believes such allocations were reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of our actual results had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. See Note 18 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding allocations. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, prior to the Separation, we used the corporate services of Tyco International for a variety of functions including treasury, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, and risk management. We no longer rely on Tyco International for these services. Overview We are a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, undersea telecommunication systems, and wireless systems. We operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Undersea Telecommunications, and Wireless Systems. We design, manufacture, and market approximately 500,000 different products for customers in industries ranging from automotive, appliance, and aerospace and defense to telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics. We believe the end markets that we sell into are balanced with the total end market demand for electronic components. We service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by nearly 8,000 engineers, as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers anywhere in the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs. Our strategic objective is to increase our revenue and profitability across all of our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities: leverage our market leadership position to increase our market share; achieve market leadership in attractive and under penetrated industries; extend our leadership in key emerging markets; supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions; continue to focus our existing portfolio; improve operating margins; and accelerate new product development through research and development excellence. Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include: Market conditions. We have experienced sales growth that was driven by the continued increased use of electronics across the end markets that we serve. This sales growth was achieved despite industry pricing pressures. Over the periods shown, we have experienced price erosion of approximately 1% to 3%. We expect price erosion to continue in the future. The increase in our net sales for each fiscal year in the periods shown reflects volume increases that more than offset the impact of pricing pressures. Raw material price increases. We purchase approximately 200 million pounds of copper and approximately 220,000 troy ounces of gold annually. During the periods shown, the prices of these key raw materials, as well as the prices of certain other raw materials, have increased substantially. Copper prices remain high relative to historical levels, but the rate of increase has 36 slowed over the past year. The following table illustrates the increase in average prices related to our most significant raw materials, copper and gold, during the periods presented: Fiscal Year Measure 2008 2007 2006 Copper Lb. $ 3.40 $ 3.20 $ 2.80 Gold Troy oz. $ 870 $ 653 $ 572 Foreign exchange. Approximately 54% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: U.S. Dollar 46 % Euro 32 Japanese Yen 7 Chinese Renminbi 3 Korean Won 3 British Pound Sterling 2 All others 7 Total 100 % Economic Conditions Current instability in the worldwide financial markets, including volatility in and disruption of the credit markets, has resulted in uncertain economic conditions along with significant volatility in raw material costs and currency markets. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets. As a result of recent economic trends, we anticipate a 15% to 20% decrease in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of slowing demand in the consumer related end markets served by our Electronic Components segment. Specifically, the economic uncertainty has had the most pronounced effect in the automotive market, where major manufacturers in all regions have significantly reduced their production forecasts for the December quarter. As a result, we expect our automotive net sales to decline approximately 20% to 25% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2008. The decline in net sales coupled with anticipated unfavorable factory cost absorption will result in lower operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage our currency exposures related to operating costs. In early fiscal 2009, there has been significant volatility in certain eastern European currencies which has resulted in foreign currency losses of approximately $50 million primarily related to the mark to market of derivative financial instruments. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. (See further discussion in 37 "Liquidity and Capital Resources Capitalization.") A more severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2008, our board of directors authorized us to pursue the divestiture of our Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. In September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million pre tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a $31 million pre tax gain on the sale. The proceeds received in both transactions are subject to final working capital adjustments. The divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, we assessed Power Systems assets for impairment and determined that the book value of the Power Systems business exceeded its estimated fair value. We recorded a $585 million pre tax impairment charge in fiscal 2007 in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. In fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of the Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre tax gain on the sale. During fiscal 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our Printed Circuit Group business. In fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre tax gain on the sale. The Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the Wireless Systems segment. Both the Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the Other segment, which has been renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment. See Note 6 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Divestitures and Manufacturing Simplification As part of our strategy, we regularly review and consider the divestiture of underperforming or non strategic businesses to improve our operating results and better utilize our capital. We have made strategic divestitures in the past and expect that we may make additional divestitures in the future. Some of these divestitures may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, by migrating facilities from high cost to low cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to low cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us to maintain our competitiveness in the industry. In connection with our manufacturing rationalization plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of up to $200 million from fiscal 2009 through 2010. Class Action Settlement As previously reported, Tyco International settled 32 purported securities class action lawsuits arising from actions alleged to have been taken by its prior management. All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order approving the settlement expired on February 21, 2008. Tyco International received opt out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members, including shares owned by the State of New Jersey pension funds 38 mentioned below. A number of these individuals and entities have filed claims separately against Tyco International and or Tyco International, Covidien, and us. Under the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants, and ten other individuals in consideration for the payment of $2,975 million from Tyco International to the certified class. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation, each of Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement and any judgments resulting from opt out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies shared in the liability and related escrow account, with Tyco International assuming 27%, Covidien 42%, and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount. In fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal 2007, we were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco Internationals expected recovery of certain costs from insurers. The net charge of $887 million was recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as litigation settlement, net. The portion allocated to us was consistent with the sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earned interest that was payable to the class. In addition, interest was accrued on the class action settlement liability. At fiscal year end 2007, we reflected $928 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for our portion of the escrow. We also reflected a $2,992 million liability and a $2,064 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien for their portion of the liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. The finalization of the settlement in February 2008 resulted in the extinguishment of our class action settlement liability of $3,020 million, interest in the escrow of $936 million, and class action settlement receivable of $2,084 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The finalization of the class action settlement resulted in a decrease to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2008. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had previously fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above. The settlement did not resolve all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the settlement did not resolve claims arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") and the lawsuits arising thereunder. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for additional information about these proceedings. If the unresolved securities proceedings, including the opt out cases noted above, were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, our share of any additional potential losses, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Settlement of Securities Proceedings Not Covered by the Class Action Settlement As previously reported, on April 29, 2008, Tyco International signed a definitive agreement with the State of New Jersey, on behalf of several of the States pension funds, to settle the action captioned New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., brought by the State in 2002 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Tyco International, its former auditors, and certain of its former officers and directors, alleging that the defendants had, among other things, violated federal and state securities and other laws through the unauthorized and improper actions of Tyco Internationals former management. The agreement with the State of New Jersey provided for Tyco International to make a payment of $73 million to the plaintiffs in exchange for the plaintiffs agreement to dismiss the case and release all claims asserted or which might have been asserted therein, which payment was 39 made on June 2, 2008. In fiscal 2008, we recorded a charge of $23 million, for which no tax benefit was available. The charge represented our share of the settlement costs in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As previously reported, on June 2, 2008, Tyco International entered into an agreement in principle with the trustee of various trusts that brought claims against Tyco International in the previously disclosed action captioned Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al., in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, alleging, among other things, securities fraud in connection with Tyco Internationals acquisition in 1999 of AMP Incorporated. A definitive settlement agreement and release was executed on June 10, 2008. The settlement agreement and release set forth the terms pursuant to which the parties settled all claims between them that were raised or could have been raised in the litigation. The settlement agreement and release provided that Tyco International make a payment of $36 million to the plaintiffs, which payment was subject to the sharing formula contained in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Pursuant to the sharing formula, our net liability was approximately $11 million, with Tyco International and Covidien responsible for approximately $10 million and $15 million, respectively. Non GAAP Financial Measures Organic net sales growth, which is included in the discussion below, is a non GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under managements control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. Organic net sales growth is also a component of our compensation programs. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in Results of Operations below provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP. 40   Results of Operations Consolidated and Combined Operations The following table sets forth certain items from our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations and the percentage of net sales that such items represent for the periods shown.

Net sales increased $1,875 million, or 14.5%, to $14,834 million in fiscal 2008 from $12,959 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2007, net sales increased $1,148 million, or 9.7%, to $12,959 million from $11,811 million in fiscal 2006. On an organic basis, net sales increased 7.9% in fiscal 2008, reflecting growth in all of our business segments with above Company average growth in our Undersea Telecommunications and Wireless Systems segments. Organic net sales increased 5.9% in fiscal 2007 as a result of strong growth in our Undersea Telecommunications segment and sales in international markets. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, favorably impacted net sales by $850 million, or 6.6%, in fiscal 2008 and $429 million, or 3.6%, in fiscal 2007. Price erosion adversely affected net sales by $191 million in fiscal 2008, $197 million in fiscal 2007, and $286 million in fiscal 2006. See further discussion below under Results of Operations by Segment. The following table sets forth the percentage of our total net sales by geographic region: Fiscal 2008 2007 2006 Americas 36 % 35 % 36 % Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) 37 37 36 Asia Pacific 27 28 28 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 41 The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by geographic region: Fiscal 2008 2007 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Organic(1) Translation(2) Total Organic(1) Translation(2) Acquisitions Total ($ in millions) Americas(3) $ 710 15.9 % $ 87 $ 797 17.9 % $ 173 4.1 % $ 101 $ $ 274 6.5 % Europe/Middle East/Africa 116 2.4 583 699 14.5 227 5.3 308 17 552 12.9 Asia Pacific 199 5.4 180 379 10.3 302 9.0 20 322 9.6 Total $ 1,025 7.9 % $ 850 $ 1,875 14.5 % $ 702 5.9 % $ 429 $ 17 $ 1,148 9.7 % (1)Represents the change in net sales resulting from volume and price changes, before consideration of acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

(2)Represents the change in net sales resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross Income. Gross income increased $431 million in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of higher sales volume. Gross income as a percentage of net sales decreased by 40 basis points in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. We were negatively impacted by lower volume growth in certain consumer related end markets in our Electronic Components segment and significant growth in our Undersea Telecommunications segment which has a margin below our Company average. In fiscal 2007, gross income increased by $145 million over fiscal 2006; however, gross income as a percentage of net sales decreased by 120 basis points. Our margin percentage declined due to higher 42 organic growth in lower margin markets such as Undersea Telecommunications. We also were negatively impacted by lower plant productivity in North America as a result of sales declines in that market by our Electronic Components segment in fiscal 2007. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.3% in fiscal 2008 as compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, selling, general, and administrative expenses included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate related to our Electronic Components segment. Excluding this gain, selling, general, and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2008 due to sales volume leverage of our overhead structure. In 2007, selling, general, and administrative expenses included allocated overhead expenses from Tyco International of $152 million. Also, we incurred costs of $41 million in fiscal 2007 related to building separate company functions. A portion of these costs were duplicative in fiscal 2007 as we were also allocated costs related to these functions from Tyco International until the Separation date. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.3% and 12.2% in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prior to Separation, selling, general, and administrative expenses included allocated overhead expenses from Tyco International, which decreased by $25 million to $152 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to $177 million in fiscal 2006. As discussed above, we incurred costs of $41 million in fiscal 2007 related to building separate company functions that did not exist in the prior fiscal year. Litigation Settlement, Net. In fiscal 2008, we recorded a net charge of $22 million related to legacy securities litigation. A charge of $11 million, for which no tax benefit was available, was recorded in connection with Tyco Internationals settlement of previously disclosed securities litigation captioned Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. for $36 million. Also, in connection with Tyco Internationals settlement of securities litigation with the State of New Jersey for $73 million, we recorded a charge of $23 million, for which no tax benefit was available. These charges represent our share of the settlement costs in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Also, we recorded income of $12 million in fiscal 2008 related to Tyco Internationals recovery of certain costs from insurers. As discussed above in "Overview Class Action Settlement," in connection with the class action settlement, we were allocated a net charge from Tyco International of $887 million in fiscal 2007. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding the class action settlement and the settlement of legacy securities litigation. Separation Costs. In connection with the Separation, we incurred costs of $44 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to employee costs, including non cash compensation expense of $11 million related to the modification of share option awards at Separation and $12 million related to the acceleration of restricted share award vesting as a result of Separation. See Note 24 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information on the conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. Net restructuring and other charges were $185 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to $92 million in fiscal 2007. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, increased $97 million to $194 million in fiscal 2008 from $97 million in fiscal 2007. Increases resulted from our strategic priority to simplify our manufacturing footprint. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we initiated restructuring actions primarily relating to the migration of product lines to low cost countries and the exit of certain manufacturing operations in the Electronic Components and Network Solutions segments. Fiscal 2007 actions also related to the rationalization of 43 a product line in the Wireless Systems segment. Restructuring charges recorded in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 primarily related to employee severance and benefits. See Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding restructuring and other charges, net. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets. During fiscal 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $137 million in the Electronic Components segment, consisting of a goodwill impairment of $103 million and long lived asset impairment of $34 million. The goodwill impairment, which related to the Global Application and Tooling Division reporting unit, was incurred when the reporting unit experienced slower growth and profitability than managements previous expectations and lower future expectations in certain end markets. The long lived asset impairment was comprised of $22 million related to the pending divestiture of our Battery Systems business and $12 million related to certain dedicated manufacturing lines serving the North American automotive market. In September 2008, our board of directors authorized management to proceed with strategic alternatives with respect to our Battery Systems business. Subsequent to fiscal year end 2008, we signed an agreement with a third party to sell this business for $30 million. Consequently, a pre tax impairment charge of $22 million has been recorded in fiscal 2008 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to the fair value. See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets. Income from Operations. Income from operations was $1,746 million, or 11.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2008 as compared to $716 million, or 5.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, restructuring related costs and legacy litigation expenses were $194 million and $22 million, respectively. Fiscal 2008 results also included $137 million of impairment charges and a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate. Fiscal 2007 results included $887 million of allocated net class action settlement charges, $44 million of separation costs, $41 million of costs related to building separate company functions, and $97 million of restructuring related and other charges. Excluding these items, higher sales levels drove the increases in income from operations. The increase as a percentage of net sales resulted from increased operating margin in our Undersea Telecommunications and Wireless Systems segments, primarily due to sales volume leverage of our overhead structure. Income from operations was $716 million, or 5.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 as compared to $1,742 million, or 14.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. The decline resulted primarily from allocated net class action settlement costs of $887 million in fiscal 2007 and a higher level of restructuring and other charges of $84 million related to our strategic initiative to simplify our manufacturing operations.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, Electronic Components net sales increased $932 million, or 9.2%, to $11,043 million from $10,111 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $689 million, or 6.8%, in fiscal 2008. Organic net sales growth of 2.4% in fiscal 2008 resulted from increases in volume partially offset by price erosion. Electronic Components organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the industrial, communications, and aerospace and defense markets in fiscal 2008. Our organic net sales growth of 15.0% in the industrial market in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was due to global demand for products in the solar and oil and gas markets and investment in industrial equipment for emerging markets. In the communications market, our organic net sales growth of 12.1% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to 28.8% growth in our sales of interconnect components to 45 mobile phone manufacturers resulting from our strategic efforts to increase our market share as well as end market unit growth. Our organic net sales growth of 8.7% in the aerospace and defense market in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was attributable to continued strong demand in this end market. In the automotive market, our organic net sales growth of 2.8% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 resulted from growth in the Asia Pacific region of 12.2% and the EMEA region of 3.8% partially offset by a 17.0% decline in the North America region that was driven by continued reductions in production by automotive manufacturers. In the computer market, our organic net sales decline of 6.2% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 resulted from a strategic decision to exit certain low margin products, which negatively impacted net sales by approximately $57 million, and to be more selective in the new projects in which we participate. Electronic Components operating income decreased $52 million, or 3.9%, to $1,287 million in fiscal 2008 from $1,339 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, segment results included goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges of $137 million and a gain on the sale of real estate of $36 million. In addition, Electronic Components incurred $33 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International. Excluding these items, higher sales were partially offset by higher raw material costs as well as increased restructuring costs of $112 million in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Electronic Components net sales increased $725 million, or 7.7%, to $10,111 million in fiscal 2007 from $9,386 million in fiscal 2006. Approximately $333 million, or 3.5%, of the increase was due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Organic net sales growth of 4.0% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was attributable to increases in volume partially offset by price erosion. In fiscal 2007, Electronic Components organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the consumer electronics, industrial, and aerospace and defense end markets. Our organic growth of 11.7% in the consumer electronics market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 resulted from continued strong consumer demand as well as our continued focus on this market. In the industrial market, our organic net sales growth of 11.5% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 resulted from strong demand globally as companies continued to invest in factory automation. In the aerospace and defense market, our organic net sales growth of 10.6% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by strength in North America and Europe in the commercial aerospace market. Our organic net sales growth of 5.4% in the automotive market in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was attributable to growth in the Asia Pacific region of 13.0% and the EMEA region of 5.4% partially offset by a decline in the North America region that was driven by reduced production by automotive manufacturers. Finally, in the computer market, our organic net sales declined 3.9% in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to a strategic decision to exit certain low margin products which negatively impacted net sales by $83 million. Electronic Components operating income decreased $65 million, or 4.6%, to $1,339 million in fiscal 2007 from $1,404 million in fiscal 2006. Benefits from higher sales and favorable foreign currency increases were reduced by lower productivity resulting from sales declines in North America primarily in automotive, housing related, and communications markets. Also, restructuring costs in fiscal 2007 increased $45 million as compared to fiscal 2006, and segment results included $33 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006. 46  Network Solutions Fiscal 2008 2007 2006 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 2,163 $ 1,897 $ 1,740 Income from operations $ 254 $ 231 $ 268 Operating margin 11.7 % 12.2 % 15.4 % The following table sets forth Network Solutions percentage of total net sales by primary industry end market(1): Fiscal 2008 2007 2006 Energy 45 % 45 % 44 % Communication Service Provider 27 28 31 Building Networks 25 24 22 Other 3 3 3 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1)Industry end market information about net sales is presented consistently with our internal management reporting and may be periodically revised as management deems necessary.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Network Solutions net sales increased $266 million, or 14.0%, to $2,163 million in fiscal 2008 from $1,897 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $150 million, or 7.9%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Organic net sales growth was $116 million, or 6.1%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. On an organic basis, Network Solutions organic net sales growth was strongest in the building networks industry end market in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 with growth of 11.3% attributable to strong global demand for faster, higher capacity, and more secure networks. In the energy market, our organic net sales growth of 5.7% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was attributable to solid growth in 47 EMEA, Asia, and North America. In EMEA and North America, growth resulted from the upgrade of aging grids and the demand for alternate energy sources. In both Asia and EMEA, growth was due to the build out of energy infrastructure in emerging markets. In the communication service provider market, our organic net sales growth of 3.2% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 reflects increased spending levels at certain U.S. carriers that more than offset declines in EMEA. Network Solutions operating income increased $23 million, or 10.0%, to $254 million in fiscal 2008 from $231 million in fiscal 2007. The operating income increase resulted from increases in volume and decreased restructuring costs of $12 million partially offset by a lower margin product mix and lower productivity levels in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, Network Solutions incurred $5 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Network Solutions net sales increased $157 million, or 9.0%, to $1,897 million in fiscal 2007 from $1,740 million in fiscal 2006. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, favorably affected net sales by $96 million, or 5.5%, in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. Organic net sales growth was $61 million, or 3.5%, in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, Network Solutions organic net sales growth was strong in the building networks and energy end markets; however, organic net sales declined in the communication service provider market. In the building networks market, our organic net sales growth of 16.2% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 resulted from higher pricing on copper cabling products as well as increases in non residential construction spending and network upgrades in existing buildings. Our organic net sales growth of 5.7% in the energy market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 resulted from solid growth in EMEA due to continued strong demand for high voltage products used to replace/upgrade aging grids in developed countries. On an organic basis, net sales decreased 7.4% in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2007, reflecting a pause in spending on fiber network deployments by certain operators compared to strong sales in fiscal 2006 due to hurricane related spending in the Americas and the accelerated build out of fiber networks by certain operators in Europe. Network Solutions operating income decreased $37 million, or 13.8%, to $231 million in fiscal 2007 from $268 million in fiscal 2006. Price increases offset increased raw material costs. The operating income decrease resulted from a $26 million increase in restructuring cost and a lower margin sales mix due to the sales decline in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Also, in fiscal 2007, we incurred $5 million of costs related to our Separation from Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006. Undersea Telecommunications Fiscal 2008 2007 2006 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 1,165 $ 565 $ 300 Income from operations $ 160 $ 38 $ 15 Operating margin 13.7 % 6.7 % 5.0 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, Undersea Telecommunications net sales increased $600 million, or 106.2%, to $1,165 million from $565 million in fiscal 2007. This growth was attributable to our execution of the construction of a transoceanic system that connects the U.S. and China, as well as several other projects, including large projects in Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe. Foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on net sales. 48 With the completion of the transoceanic system linking the U.S. and China, we currently expect a decline in fiscal 2009 net sales as compared to fiscal 2008; however, activity in this market remains strong, especially in Asia and emerging markets where broadband requirements continue to increase. We expect that new projects will partially offset the reduction caused by the completion of the transoceanic system. In fiscal 2008, Undersea Telecommunications operating income increased $122 million to $160 million from $38 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of increased volumes and improved operating leverage. Segment results included $1 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net sales in the Undersea Telecommunications segment increased $265 million, or 88.3%, to $565 million in fiscal 2007 from $300 million in fiscal 2006. On an organic basis, net sales increased by 88.9% in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 from our execution of the construction of a transoceanic system that connects the U.S. and China as well as a project in the oil and gas market. Undersea Telecommunications had operating income of $38 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to $15 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of increases in sales. Restructuring costs in fiscal 2007 increased $9 million as compared to fiscal 2006, and segment results included $1 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006. Wireless Systems Fiscal 2008 2007 2006 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 463 $ 386 $ 385 Income from operations $ 67 $ 39 $ 55 Operating margin 14.5 % 10.1 % 14.3 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Wireless Systems net sales increased $77 million, or 19.9%, to $463 million in fiscal 2008 from $386 million in fiscal 2007. Approximately $8 million, or 1.9%, of the increase was due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Organic net sales growth of 18.0% in fiscal 2008 resulted primarily from higher radio sales related to federally mandated re banding efforts, as well as the continued migration from analog to digital systems. Wireless Systems operating income increased $28 million, or 71.8%, to $67 million in fiscal 2008 from $39 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was the result of higher sales volumes and favorable sales mix in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Also, segment results included $3 million of restructuring costs and $2 million of costs that related to our Separation from Tyco International in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, Wireless Systems net sales increased $1 million to $386 million from $385 million in fiscal 2006. Organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 as increases in government spending in the public safety market offset reduced demand for equipment related to public safety channel re banding programs. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates was minimal. In fiscal 2007, Wireless Systems operating income decreased $16 million, or 29.1%, to $39 million from $55 million in fiscal 2006. Increased engineering and selling investment in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 negatively impacted operating income. In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by increased restructuring costs of $4 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and 49 $2 million of costs related to our Separation from Tyco International in fiscal 2007 that did not exist in fiscal 2006. Non Operating Items Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was $156 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to $178 million in fiscal 2007 and $208 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease of $22 million, or 12.4%, in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was driven by lower average debt levels. The decrease of $30 million, or 14.4%, in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was also driven by lower average debt levels. In fiscal 2007, decreases in net interest expense allocated by Tyco International were partially offset by interest incurred on our unsecured senior bridge loan and unsecured senior revolving credit facilities. A portion of Tyco Internationals net interest expense was allocated to us through June 1, 2007. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, we were allocated net interest expense of $130 million and $201 million, respectively, which included the impact of Tyco Internationals interest rate swaps. Management believes the net interest expense allocation basis was reasonable; however, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for these periods. Other Income (Expense), Net In fiscal 2008, we recorded other income of $567 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, of which $545 million related to certain incremental tax liabilities recorded in connection with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. ("FIN") 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." See Notes 2 and 19 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the adoption of FIN 48. For further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement, see Notes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Net other expense of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt. See Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, we recorded other income of $13 million associated with Tyco Internationals and Covidiens share of certain contingent tax liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 25.9% for fiscal 2008 and includes a benefit of $198 million primarily related to the pre tax income of $545 million recognized in connection with our adoption of FIN 48, for which no tax was provided. The effective tax rate was also impacted by increased accruals in fiscal 2008 of interest related to uncertain tax positions partially offset by a $42 million benefit associated with a favorable settlement with a taxing authority for certain legacy tax issues. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the benefits of increased profitability in operations in lower tax rate jurisdictions, a $33 million benefit related to adjustments to tax account balances, a $25 million increase in the valuation allowance related to restructuring charges, and a $22 million tax detriment recorded in connection with the goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was not fully realized. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 includes the effects of the pre tax charges recorded in connection with the allocated class action settlement and loss on retirement of debt for which no tax benefits were recorded. These impacts on the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 were $312 million and $81 million, respectively. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate reflects tax detriments related to increased borrowings in order to fund the class action settlement escrow and our Separation from Tyco International. 50 Our effective income tax rate was 5.3% for fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 includes a net release of $268 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in connection with improved profitability in certain jurisdictions, principally the U.S. Our U.S. results of operations in fiscal 2006 combined with other available evidence, including projections of future taxable income, indicated that it is more likely than not we will realize additional deferred tax assets in the future, and accordingly, the related valuation allowances were reduced. In addition to the valuation allowance release, effective tax rate was impacted by a $39 million state tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2006, primarily related to the Tyco Global Network divestiture, as well as $87 million of tax benefits associated with the receipt of a favorable non U.S. tax ruling permitting the deduction of historical debt retirement costs. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $873 million and $703 million at fiscal year end 2008 and 2007, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the provisions of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. Substantially all of these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in fiscal year 2009. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 26, 2008, certain subsidiaries had approximately $10 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. 51 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Income from discontinued operations was $188 million in fiscal 2008, and loss from discontinued operations was $376 million and $246 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. During fiscal 2008, our board of directors authorized us to pursue the divestiture of our Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. In September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million pre tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a $31 million pre tax gain on the sale. The proceeds received in both transactions are subject to final working capital adjustments. During fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of our Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre tax gain on the sale. During fiscal 2007, the divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized, and in connection with the approval, we recorded a $585 million pre tax impairment charge. Also, in fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre tax gain on the sale. During fiscal 2006, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $316 million related to the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors reporting units, which were reporting units in the Wireless Systems segment prior to reclassification to discontinued operations. See Note 6 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During fiscal 2006, we adopted FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." Accordingly, we have recognized asset retirement obligations of $16 million and net property, plant, and equipment of $4 million in our Combined Balance Sheet at fiscal year end 2006. In addition, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in an $8 million after tax, $12 million pre tax, loss. See Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information on FIN 47. 52  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flow from continuing operating activities for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006: Fiscal 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Income from operations $ 1,746 $ 716 $ 1,742 Class action settlement (936 ) 887 Non cash restructuring and other charges, net 47 23 4 Depreciation and amortization 559 514 459 Deferred income taxes 174 163 (14 ) Provisions for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 41 82 62 Impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 137 Other, net 38 (15 ) 6 Income tax advance payment (163 ) Changes in assets and liabilities, net (78 ) (30 ) (346 ) Interest income 32 53 48 Interest expense (188 ) (231 ) (256 ) Income tax expense (558 ) (491 ) (81 ) Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 1,014 $ 1,508 $ 1,624 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures $ (619 ) $ (875 ) $ (519 ) Proceeds from divestiture of businesses 571 227 Payment of common dividends (271 ) Repurchase of common shares (1,242 ) Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in fiscal 2008 was $1,014 million as compared to $1,508 million in fiscal 2007. The decline in fiscal 2008 was driven by the class action settlement of $936 million. As discussed above, the finalization of the class action settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 resulted in a decrease to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had previously fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability. Also, in fiscal 2007, cash from continuing operating activities was negatively impacted by a $163 million advance tax payment to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for legacy tax liabilities. We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending decreased $256 million in fiscal 2008 to $619 million as compared to $875 million in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we exercised our option to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously leased to us and used by the Undersea Telecommunications segment at a cost of $280 million, which was reflected as a capital expenditure. We expect long term capital investment levels of approximately 4% to 5% of net sales each year. In fiscal 2008, we received net cash proceeds of $102 million, $427 million, and $42 million related to the sale of the Power Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses, respectively. In fiscal 2007, we received $227 million in net cash proceeds related to the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business. Also, during fiscal 2007, we funded our portion of the class action settlement escrow for $928 million. Related net class action settlement costs of $887 million were recognized in fiscal 2007. 53 The amount of pension and postretirement benefit contributions reflected in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $77 million, $71 million, and $69 million, respectively. We anticipate pension contributions to be $70 million to $80 million per year on an ongoing basis before consideration of voluntary contributions. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $369 million, $450 million, and $274 million, respectively. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2007 included the $163 million related to the advance payment to the IRS for legacy tax liabilities. Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2008 and 2007 was $3,181 million and $3,378 million, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. During September 2007, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $800 million principal amount of 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $750 million principal amount of 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $500 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2037. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, we and TEGSA entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers under which we and TEGSA agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes, to file with the SEC an exchange offer registration statement within 210 days after the date of the original issue of the notes. The registration statement became effective April 15, 2008, and the exchange offer was completed on May 20, 2008, meeting the registration requirements. During July 2008, TEGSA issued $300 million principal amount of 5.95% senior notes due 2014. The notes were offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S 3 filed on July 1, 2008. Interest on the notes accrues from their date of issuance at a rate of 5.95% per year and is payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2009. The notes are TEGSAs unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior debt and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $298 million. In July 2008, a wholly owned subsidiary of TEGSA issued $100 million principal amount of profit sharing notes with an initial maturity date of 2010. Remuneration on the notes is paid quarterly, commencing on October 15, 2008, based on the after tax profits of the TEGSA subsidiary, with quarterly remuneration not to exceed 0.9615% of the outstanding principal. As of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $550 million of indebtedness outstanding under its unsecured senior bridge loan facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.47%. During fiscal 2008, we paid off all balances and cancelled all commitments under the unsecured senior bridge loan facility. In April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. The commitments under the revolving credit facility total $1,500 million; however, $75 million of these commitments are from a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Due to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, we believe it is unlikely that this $75 million commitment will be honored. Accordingly, our useable commitments under the five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility are likely $1,425 million. Borrowings under the five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility bear interest, at TEGSAs option, at a base rate or the London interbank offered rate plus a margin dependent on TEGSAs credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. As of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $700 million of indebtedness outstanding under the five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.38%. In July 2008, all amounts outstanding under the five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility were paid 54 off with proceeds from the issuance of the $300 million principal amount of 5.95% senior notes and $100 million principal amount of profit sharing notes, as well as cash from operations. In November 2007, TEGSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as part of our ongoing effort to enhance financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. As of fiscal year end 2008, TEGSA had $647 million of commercial paper outstanding at an average interest rate of 4.01%. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. TEGSAs payment obligations under its senior notes, five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility, commercial paper, and profit sharing notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco Electronics Ltd. Our debt agreements contain financial and other customary covenants. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 26, 2008, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. In September 2008, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share. The dividend was paid on November 4, 2008. Future dividends to holders of our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of Bermuda law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. In September 2007, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of $750 million to purchase a portion of our outstanding common shares. Our board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program from $750 million to $1,250 million in March 2008 and an additional increase in the program from $1,250 million to $2,000 million in July 2008. In fiscal 2008, we repurchased approximately 37 million common shares for $1,269 million under this program, of which $1,242 million was paid as of September 26, 2008. No common shares were repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007. On September 19, 2005, we were awarded a contract to build and operate the statewide private radio system for the State of New York. Under the contractual terms, this is a twenty year contract that requires us to build the network and lease it to the State. As we build the network over the next five years, we will need to invest approximately $500 to $550 million. As of September 26, 2008, we have invested $56 million, which is included primarily in inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On August 29, 2008, we were served by the State of New York with a default notice related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the deficiencies noted by the State. We believe that these deficiencies have been remediated and the system is operating in accordance with the contract specifications. On October 16, 2008, we certified the system ready for testing and presented our conclusions to the State of New York. The States testing is scheduled to occur in November and December 2008. The level of investment in fiscal 2009 will be dependent upon the conclusion of the States testing. We estimate that our investment in fiscal 2009 will not exceed $100 million. Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of financing, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements which are discussed above. We believe that cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs. Although we have been able to issue commercial paper, to the extent that market instability causes interruptions to the commercial paper market, we may elect to borrow under our five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. Our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by the ongoing credit market instability. We will continue to monitor the market in order to respond to changing conditions. 55   Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payments obligations under non cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2008. Payments due by fiscal year Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 There after (in millions) Debt(1)(2) $ 3,181 $ 667 $ 101 $ 1 $ $ 858 $ 1,554 Operating leases 483 118 88 67 46 37 127 Purchase obligations(3) 128 128 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 3,792 $ 913 $ 189 $ 68 $ 46 $ 895 $ 1,681 (1)Excludes interest. (2)Our outstanding commercial paper of $647 million at September 26, 2008 is classified as long term as borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. On the maturity schedule above, the $647 million is presented as maturing in fiscal 2009. (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (4)Total contractual cash obligations in the table above exclude pension and postretirement benefit obligations, income taxes, and other long term liabilities. We have pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $83 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2009 and $70 million to $80 million per year on an ongoing basis, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Income taxes and other long term liabilities are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. At September 26, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $338 million. At September 26, 2008, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com Net by the Wireless Systems segment. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as the amount of this contingency is not currently estimable. Income Tax Matters In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidiens, Tyco Electronics, and Tyco Internationals respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin offs to qualify for tax favored treatment under the Code. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco 56 International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled by Tyco Electronics with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation. Prior to Separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the provisions of FIN 48, which relate specifically to Tyco Electronics entities, have been recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco Internationals tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. See Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. In prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal years 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2005 is probable and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco Internationals U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. Tyco International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact of $458 million which was paid by Tyco International during fiscal 2007. Our portion of this payment reduced income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by $163 million. It is our understanding that Tyco International has appealed other proposed adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and is vigorously defending its prior filed tax return positions. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. Any penalty imposed would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco International is vigorously opposing the assertion of any such penalties. We continue to believe that the amounts recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to these matters are appropriate; however, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, should Tyco International lose its appeal, it could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Tyco International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns. In fiscal 2008, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and presented to the IRS. As a result, in fiscal 2008, we recorded a $225 million decrease in income tax liabilities, a $42 million decrease in deferred tax assets, a $140 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien recorded in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, a $57 million increase in the indemnification liability to Tyco 57 International and Covidien, and a $14 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien. In addition, in fiscal 2008, Tyco International, Covidien, and we completed and filed certain fiscal 2007 U.S. consolidated federal and state income tax returns which included a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and our subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded a $66 million decrease in income tax liabilities with a corresponding offset to the income tax receivable, a $44 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien and a $42 million decrease in the payable to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, a $30 million increase in contributed surplus, and a $32 million net adjustment to other related tax accounts. As our tax return positions continue to be updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to shareholders equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the Separation. Legal Matters In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a future period. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. Prior to the announcement of the planned separation in January 2006, Tyco International and certain former directors and officers were named as defendants in several lawsuits relating to securities class action, shareholder lawsuits, and ERISA related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to this outstanding litigation have been allocated among Tyco International, Covidien, and us. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of any remaining pending litigation. If Tyco International or Covidien were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would be required to pay additional amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. The liability sharing provisions regarding these class actions are set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement among Tyco International, Tyco Electronics, and Covidien.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2009 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance. We believe the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 58 In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions; however, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled by us with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our Separation from Tyco International in accordance with FIN 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," and accordingly, liabilities amounting to $339 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 26, 2008. See Notes 14 and 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. See Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding estimated product warranty.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," and SAB No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass. This generally 59 occurs when the products reach the free on board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Contract sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within our Undersea Telecommunications and Wireless Systems segments. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical experience. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are amortized on a straight line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since managements judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. 60 Estimates about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been supported by additional transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, the adjustment of such allowance may affect goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the provisions of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. Substantially all of these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. 61 Pension and Postretirement Benefit Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by $101 million, while a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by $97 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. During the year, our Investment Committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. Plans Master Trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30% equity and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008 and is expected to be completed in fiscal 2010. As a result of this change, we are lowering the fiscal 2009 expected return on plan assets for our U.S. pension plans by 0.44 percentage points to 7.55%. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by $11 million, while a 50 basis point increase in the expected long term return on plan assets would decrease our pension expense by $11 million. Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with the current credit crisis, have caused significant volatility in interest rates and equity prices, which could decrease the value of our pension plans investment portfolios. A decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios could have an adverse affect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Share Based Compensation We adopted SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," on October 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. Under SFAS No. 123R, we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes Merton valuation model. The Black Scholes Merton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected share price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk free interest rate. (See Note 24 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information related to share based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of the Companys stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense.  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." SFAS No. 162 codifies the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles to be used by the preparers of financial statements. The hierarchy is identical to that contained in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statements on Auditing Standards No. 69, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." Adoption of the standard did not have any impact on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax 62 positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 requires that an enterprise must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, including resolution of any appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold is then measured to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize in the financial statements. As a result of adopting FIN 48, we recorded a net increase in contingent tax liabilities of $1,197 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $648 million, and a corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated earnings of $549 million. See Note 19 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. We currently use a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The measurement date provisions will become effective for us in fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact of the measurement date change provisions on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We adopted the funded status recognition provisions at September 28, 2007. The incremental effects of adopting the standard on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were increases of $386 million in long term pension and postretirement benefit liabilities, $16 million in accrued and other current liabilities, and $55 million in other assets. The impact of adoption also resulted in additional net deferred tax assets of $122 million. The impact of adoption to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of equity, was a reduction of $225 million. There was no impact on pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefits plans in fiscal 2007. On going compliance with the standard will not impact pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefit plans. See Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further discussion of the implementation of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, "Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements." SAB No. 108 provides guidance on evaluating the materiality of prior periods misstatements, quantifying the effects of correcting misstatements in the current period, and criteria for restatement of prior periods. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted this guidance effective for fiscal 2007. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 157 3, "Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset when the Market for That Asset Is Not Active." FSP No. FAS 157 3 clarifies the methods employed in determining the fair value for financial assets when a market for such assets is not active. FSP No. FAS 157 3 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 157 3 will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 03 6 1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities." FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 concludes that unvested restricted share awards that pay nonforfeitable cash dividends are participating securities and are subject to the two class method of computing earnings per share. FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 63 2010. We do not expect that adoption of FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 will have a material impact on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142 3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets." FSP No. FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." FSP No. FAS 142 3 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact that FSP No. FAS 142 3 will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133." SFAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," to provide improved transparency into the uses and financial statement impact of derivative instruments and hedging activities. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 161 in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 161 will have on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141R replaces SFAS No. 141 and addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 141R will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements." SFAS No. 160 addresses the accounting and reporting framework for minority interests by a parent company. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 160 will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In June 2007, the FASB EITF issued EITF Issue No. 06 11, "Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards." EITF 06 11 requires that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalent units paid on unvested restricted shares and restricted share units be reflected as an increase in contributed surplus and reflected as an addition to our excess tax benefit pool, as defined under SFAS No. 123R. EITF 06 11 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of EITF 06 11 will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not expect to use the fair value election for any existing assets or liabilities as of the date of adoption. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 64  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward looking statements include, among others, the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "may," "should," or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. You should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward looking statements after we file this report except as required by law. Among the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements are the risks described in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors." There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty. Foreign Currency Exposures As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we use foreign exchange forwards and swaps. The objective is to manage our foreign currency exposures on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 26, 2008 market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $95 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $116 million. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 28, 2007 market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $59 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $72 million. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. 65  Interest Rate Exposures We issue debt, from time to time, in capital markets to fund our operations. Such borrowings can result in interest rate and or currency exposure. To manage these exposures and to minimize overall interest cost, we have used and may use in the future interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the fixed rate debt into variable rate debt (fair value hedges) and or convert a portion of the variable rate debt into fixed rate debt (cash flow hedges). At September 26, 2008, we had outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on $300 million principal amount of our 6.55% senior notes and $200 million principal amount of our 6.00% senior notes. At September 28, 2007, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. Based on our floating rate debt balances of $1,147 million and $1,250 million at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively, an increase in the levels of the U.S. dollar interest rates by 0.5%, with all other variables held constant, would result in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately $6 million. Commodity Exposures Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we have used and may use in the future forward or option contracts. We continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months and periodically enter into commodity forward or option contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At September 26, 2008, we had entered into commodity forward contracts, specifically related to gold, designated as cash flow hedges for a notional value of $21 million. A 10% appreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold from the September 26, 2008 prices would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $2 million, while a 10% depreciation of prices would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $2 million.
