Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of Teradynes plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Teradynes actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in "Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results" and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Teradyne to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, Teradyne evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies and litigation. Teradyne bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. It is Teradynes policy to require an arrangement with its customers, either in the form of a written or electronic contract or purchase order containing all of the terms and conditions governing the arrangement, prior to the recognition of revenue. Title and risk of loss generally passes to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier. At the time of the transaction, Teradyne assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms of the arrangement. If a significant portion of the sales price is not due with normal payment terms, the sales price may not be deemed fixed and revenue would be recognized as the amounts become due. Teradyne does not offer a right of return on its products. Teradyne assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer. Teradyne performs on going credit evaluations of its customers financial condition but generally does not require collateral from its customers. If Teradyne determines that collectibility of the sales price is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment from the customer. Revenue is recognized upon delivery provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, Teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. Teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. In order to recognize revenue the functionality of the undelivered element must not be essential to the delivered element. Installation is not considered essential to the functionality of the product as these services do not alter the product capabilities, do not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. In addition to installation, other elements may include service arrangements and undelivered products. Teradynes products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of sales when product revenue is recognized. 13 Interconnection systems and electronic manufacturing assembly services revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under Statement of Accounting Position No. 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts," revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon an efforts expended method. The software in these arrangements requires significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which determined. To date revenue under contract accounting has not been material. Inventories which include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such an impairment is identified through the quarterly review process. Excess and obsolete inventory, consisting of on hand and non cancelable on order inventory, in excess of estimated usage over the next 12 months is written down to its estimated net realizable value, if less than cost. The excess and obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. In 2001, Teradyne recorded an inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $139.7 million which includes a writedown for discontinued product lines of $34.5 million. If actual demand, product mix or possible alternative uses are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. Realization of Teradynes net deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate approximately $415 million of future taxable income. Teradyne believes that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income, however, there can be no assurance that Teradyne will be able to meet its expectations of future income. If Teradyne continues to incur significant losses for an extended period of time, Teradyne could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of its net deferred tax assets. To the extent Teradyne establishes a valuation allowance, an expense will be recorded within the provision for income taxes line in the statement of operations. Teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors Teradyne considers important which could indicate an impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of Teradynes use of the acquired asset or the strategy for Teradynes overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. When Teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, Teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by its management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business model. During 2001, Teradyne recorded charges of $32.3 million related to the impairment of certain excess facilities and long lived assets. Intangible assets, long lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2001. The volatility of the industries that Teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows, which can impact their ability to make required payments. Teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. At December 31, 2001, this allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to $6.3 million. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customers current payment history, the customers current financial statements and other information regarding the customers credit worthiness. If the financial condition of Teradynes customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 14 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 (dollars in thousands) Net sales........................................................ $1,440,581 $3,043,946 $1,790,912 (Loss) income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle...................................................... $ (202,215) $ 517,754 $ 191,694 (Decrease) increase in net sales from preceding year: Amount...........................................................

(14.0)% 14.9 % 10.7% On October 26, 2001, Teradyne completed its acquisition of GenRad, Inc. of Westford, MA, a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment, related software, and diagnostic solutions. GenRads business has been made a part of the Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems operating segment. GenRad activity is reflected in Teradynes results of operations since the acquisition date. See "Note F: Acquisitions and Divestitures" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Results of Operations: 2001 compared to 2000 Revenue Teradynes four principal operating segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net sales for each of last three years: % of consolidated net sales 2001 2000 1999 Semiconductor Test Systems............... 50% 67% 68% Connection Systems....................... 38 24 21 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 9 5 6 Other Test Systems....................... 3 4 5 Total.................................... 100% 100% 100% 15 Sales decreased 53% in 2001 to $1,440.6 million from $3,043.9 million in 2000. Semiconductor Test Systems sales decreased 65%, to $717.7 million in 2001 from $2,044.0 million in 2000, Connection Systems sales to unaffiliated customers decreased 26%, to $540.8 million in 2001 from $734.6 million in 2000, and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems sales decreased 6%, to $132.4 million in 2001 from $141.2 million in 2000. These decreases reflect the overall economic and industry market conditions described below. Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems sales include the two month impact of the GenRad acquisition which contributed sales of $19.0 million. Other Test Systems sales decreased 60%, to $49.7 million in 2001 from $124.1 million in 2000, which principally reflects the divestiture of Software Test Systems at the end of 2000 as well as the overall economic and industry market conditions described below. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Teradyne implemented Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB 101) retroactive to the beginning of the year. Included in 2001 sales was $98.7 million related to shipments of customer orders in 2000 where title was retained by Teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security interest. Teradyne no longer retains title until customer payment. Teradynes business has been adversely impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide including the effects of the hostilities begun in September 2001. Teradyne has also been adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the electronics and semiconductor industries, which experience recurring periods of oversupply of products and equipment of the type Teradyne sells. These factors have resulted in a downturn in the demand for Teradynes products. During 2001, orders declined significantly across all of Teradynes product lines when compared with the orders Teradyne received during 2000. The reduction in net orders across Teradyne for 2001 compared with 2000 was approximately $2,512.7 million. Teradynes experience in previous downturns has been that orders improve as Teradynes customers capital expenditures increase. At present, however, Teradyne cannot say how long the current downturn will last or when the situation will improve. In the absence of significant improvement, orders could remain low or decline further, and the amount of Teradynes inventory, deferred tax assets, and certain long lived assets considered realizable could be significantly reduced. In 2001 and 2000, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales. In 2001, Teradynes three largest customers accounted for 24% of consolidated net sales. Bookings Net orders decreased 76% to $808.2 million in 2001 from $3,320.9 million in 2000. Net orders decreased in all operating segments and were led by a 85% decrease in Semiconductor Test Systems net orders. Connection Systems net orders, Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems net orders, and Other Test Systems net orders decreased 64%, 33%, and 78%, respectively. Teradyne experienced cancellations of $285.5 million during 2001. Teradynes net orders for its four principal operating segments for 2001 and 2000 were as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 Semiconductor Test Systems............... $294.0 $1,960.5 Connection Systems....................... 385.0 1,082.0 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 101.4 151.6 Other Test Systems....................... 27.8 126.8 $808.2 $3,320.9 Teradynes backlog decreased 45% to $763.0 million in 2001 from $1,382.1 million in 2000. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments was as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 Semiconductor Test Systems............... $317.2 $ 742.1 Connection Systems....................... 357.6 534.4 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 55.5 68.4 Other Test Systems....................... 32.7 37.2 $763.0 $1,382.1 16 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, Teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business and results of operations. Gross Margin Certain costs in 2001 and 2000 have been reclassified from cost of sales into engineering and development and selling and administrative. These reclassified costs consist of new product development costs incurred in manufacturing engineering, test technology and applications engineering costs supporting sales. The costs reclassified from cost of sales to engineering and development represent work performed to develop and implement manufacturing and test processes focused on the introduction of new product platforms. The costs reclassified from cost of sales to selling and administrative represent the development of applications programming used to demonstrate new product capabilities. The impact of the reclassifications is detailed below: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, Increase / (Decrease) 2001 2000 (in thousands) Cost of sales.............. ($57,046) ($62,325) Engineering and development 39,750 47,104 Selling and administrative. 17,296 15,221 Cost of sales, excluding the charges described below, increased to 71% of sales in 2001 from 53% of sales in 2000. The percentage increase in 2001 was attributable to the decreased utilization of Teradynes manufacturing capacity, as sales volume decreased while certain components of costs of sales remained fixed. The increase in the percentage of cost of sales was also impacted to a lesser extent by increased competitive price pressure as current semiconductor products mature and the mix of Teradynes business changes as Connection Systems and Circuit Board Test and Inspection System sales, which have lower gross margins, become a larger percentage of Teradynes business. Teradyne introduced a number of new products in 2001. Generally, Teradynes new products begin their product life with lower gross margins and margins improve as volume purchases increase and cost reduction activities are implemented. There can be no assurance that significant improvements in gross margins will be achieved on current or new Teradyne products through either volume purchases or cost reduction activities. Cost of sales related to inventory provisions and other charges for asset impairments and vacated leases was $159.8 million in 2001. Inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was $105.2 million in 2001, which excludes the inventory writedowns for product line discontinuance, compared to $27.5 million in 2000, included in cost of sales, representing a 5% increase. The increase in the inventory provision was caused by the worldwide economic slowdown during 2001. Between 2000 and 2001, orders declined by approximately $2,512.7 million, a 76% decrease. This drop in orders combined with lead time requirements for inventory procurement and Teradynes new product introduction plans necessitated additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory. During 2001, Teradyne recorded an inventory writedown in Semiconductor Test Systems due to the discontinuance of the Flash 750 product line of $32.3 million and related asset impairments of $4.6 million. In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, Teradyne recorded a charge of $15.4 million for certain impaired manufacturing assets and vacated space under operating leases at Connection Systems. Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 20% in 2001 from 11% in 2000, with spending decreasing by $59.4 million. This spending decrease was primarily due to lower material costs and the impact of workforce reductions, salary cuts, and furloughs in Semiconductor Test Systems and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, excluding the impact of the GenRad acquisition. Connection Systems engineering and development spending increased 5% from 2000 to 2001. 17 Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses increased to 19% of sales in 2001 from 12% of sales in 2000, with spending decreasing by $107.7 million. The decrease in spending was principally due to certain cost containment programs such as workforce reductions, salary cuts, and furloughs. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges include a workforce reduction and early retirement provision of $37.3 million, a charge for a Connection Systems impaired facility of $12.0 million, a charge for impaired assets of $1.9 million relating to the discontinuance of the Flash 750 product line in Semiconductor Test Systems, and a charge for vacated space under certain operating leases of $1.7 million in Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems. There were approximately 2,900 employees terminated in 2001 across all functional groups. These terminations will result in future cost savings in 2002 of approximately $132.0 million. Teradyne has paid $23.8 million in severance benefits during 2001. All remaining severance benefits for employees terminated in 2001 will be paid by the fourth quarter of 2002. Below is a table summarizing activity relating to restructuring and other charges: Lease Payments Severance on and Vacated Impaired Impaired Benefits Facilities Facilities Assets Total (in thousands) 2001 provision.............. $ 37,278 $1,676 $ 12,000 $ 1,923 $ 52,877 Cash payments............... (23,755) (23,755) Non cash charges............ (12,000) (1,923) (13,923) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ 13,523 $1,676 $ $ $ 15,199 The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings and the accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities. Interest income and expense Interest income decreased by $2.4 million to $22.7 million in 2001 compared to $25.1 million in 2000. The decrease in 2001 was attributable to decreases in the average invested balances and lower interest rates. Interest expense increased by $2.3 million as a result of interest expense for two months associated with Teradynes convertible notes. Other income and expense Included in other income in 2001 is a gain from the sale of Connections Systems aerospace and defense business of $14.8 million. Included in other expense for 2001 is Teradynes proportionate share of a loss related to an equity method investment of $7.0 million. Income before taxes (Loss) income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was a loss of $326.2 million in 2001 compared to income of $739.6 million in 2000. Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems, Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, and Other Test Systems income before income taxes decreased $907.2 million, $167.5 million, $40.3 million, and $3.3 million, respectively in 2001 due to decreased sales in each group and the market conditions described above. 18 Income taxes Teradynes effective tax rate benefit was 38% in 2001. The effective tax rate provision for the year ended 2000 was 30%. The change in the tax rate is a result of a loss in 2001. In 2000, Teradyne was able to reduce its effective tax rate with tax benefits from its foreign sales corporation and Ireland manufacturing operations. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. Realization of Teradynes net deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate approximately $415 million of future taxable income. Teradyne believes that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income. However, if Teradyne continues to incur significant losses for an extended period of time, it could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of its net deferred tax assets. To the extent Teradyne establishes a valuation allowance, an expense will be recorded within the provision for income taxes line in the statement of operations. In response to an adverse World Trade Organization (WTO) finding that the U.S. Foreign Sales Credit (FSC) tax provisions were a prohibited export subsidy, the U.S. repealed FSC and enacted replacement legislation (Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000). The European Union filed a WTO challenge to the new law and the WTO has upheld the European Unions challenge. The U.S. has decided to appeal and the appellate process and final resolution of this matter could extend beyond 2002. The U.S. government and industry groups are evaluating options. It is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this issue will have on future earnings pending final resolution of the challenge. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the FSC benefited Teradynes effective tax rate as follows: 2001 2000 1999 Export sales corporation (0.7%) (4.8%) (4.7%) 2000 compared to 1999 Revenue Sales increased 70% in 2000 to a record $3,043.9 million from $1,790.9 million in 1999. Semiconductor Test Systems shipments increased by 69% due to increased sales to semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors as these customers increased capacity to meet their customers requirements. Sales of Connection Systems to unaffiliated customers grew 97% as a result of significant growth in demand from networking, data storage, and other high technology customers. Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems sales increased by 19% from 1999. Other Test Systems sales increased 40% from 1999 with increases in Broadband Test Systems of 10% and Software Test Systems of 64%. Due to the sale of a majority interest in the software test business in December 2000, Software Test Systems revenue will not be reflected on an on going basis. Bookings Incoming net orders increased 52% from $2,190.6 million in 1999 to a record $3,320.9 million in 2000. Net orders increased in all operating segments and were led by a 159% increase in Connection Systems net orders. Semiconductor Test Systems net orders increased 24%. Broadband Test Systems net orders increased 77% and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems and Software Test Systems increased 26% and 70%, respectively. Teradynes backlog increased 41% to a record $1,382.1 million. Gross Margin Certain costs in 2000 and 1999 have been reclassified from cost of sales into engineering and development and selling and administrative. These reclassified costs consist of new product development costs incurred in manufacturing engineering, test technology and applications engineering costs supporting sales. The costs 19 reclassified from cost of sales to engineering and development represent work performed to develop and implement manufacturing and test processes focused on the introduction of new product platforms. The costs reclassified from cost of sales to selling and administrative represent the development of applications programming used to demonstrate new product capabilities. The impact of the reclassifications is detailed below: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, Increase / (Decrease) 2000 1999 (in thousands) Cost of sales.............. $(62,325) $(43,536) Engineering and development 47,104 33,291 Selling and administrative. 15,221 10,245 Costs of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from 56% of sales in 1999 to 53% of sales in 2000. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the increased utilization of Teradynes manufacturing overhead as sales volume increased while certain components of cost of sales remained fixed. Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses decreased from 15% of sales in 1999 to 11% of sales in 2000, even though spending increased $86.2 million. The increase in spending was primarily due to new product development expenses in Semiconductor Test Systems, and, to a lesser extent, increased expenses related to product development in Connection Systems, Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, and Software Test Systems. Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 15% in 1999 to 12% in 2000. Spending increased by $111.1 million year over year in support of increased Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems, and Software Test Systems sales. Interest income and expense Interest income increased $7.8 million to $25.1 million in 2000 compared to $17.3 million in 1999. Interest income increased due to an increase in Teradynes average invested balances and higher interest rates. Other income and expense Included in other income in 2000 is an immaterial gain relating to the divestiture of the software test business. Income before taxes Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased $465.8 million from $273.8 million in 1999 to $739.6 million in 2000. Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems, Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, and Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased $387.4 million, $91.8 million, $7.0 million, and $9.5 million, respectively in 2000 due to increased sales in each group. Income taxes Teradynes effective tax rate was 30% in 2000 and 1999. Teradyne continued to utilize export sales corporation benefits and other tax benefits to operate below the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. 20 Liquidity and Capital Resources Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $121.8 million in 2001, to $586.2 million. Teradyne used cash from operating activities of $79.0 million in 2001 and generated cash from operating activities in 2000 and 1999 of $470.9 million and $367.5 million, respectively. Net income (loss), adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash items, used cash of $77.1 million in 2001, and provided cash of $501.6 million and $279.7 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Changes in operating assets and liabilities net of businesses sold and acquired used cash of $1.9 million in 2001 as accounts payable and accruals balances decreased as purchases slowed. The decrease in accounts payable and accruals was partially offset by reduced accounts receivable and inventory balances. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $30.7 million in 2000 and generated cash of $87.7 million in 1999. Teradyne used $247.3 million of cash for investing activities in 2001, $312.3 million in 2000, and $244.8 million in 1999. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, cash acquired in business acquisitions, and purchases of capital assets to support long term growth. Capital expenditures decreased by $56.8 million in 2001 compared with 2000, primarily in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment. This was due to the actions taken by Teradyne in 2001 to reduce planned capital expenditures due to current market conditions. Capital expenditures were $241.4 million in 2001, $298.2 million in 2000, and $151.2 million in 1999. Teradyne generated $401.5 million of cash from financing activities in 2001, used $97.5 million in 2000, and used $126.8 million in 1999. Financing activities include the issuance of convertible notes, mortgage borrowings, sales and repurchases of Teradynes common stock, as well as repayments of debt. In 2001, Teradyne assumed debt of $89.7 million from the GenRad acquisition which Teradyne repaid on October 26, 2001. During 2001, 2000, and 1999 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $58.5 million, $55.3 million, and $82.3 million, respectively. Teradyne used cash for the acquisition of treasury stock of $147.5 million and $207.8 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Since 1996, Teradyne has used $540.8 million of cash to repurchase 20.0 million shares of its common stock on the open market though no cash was used in 2001 to repurchase shares of common stock. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne sold $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 (the "Notes") in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. The Notes are redeemable by Teradyne at any time after October 18, 2004 at specified prices. Teradyne will begin making annual interest payments of up to $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Teradyne that rank equally with Teradynes existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In the event of a change in control by which Teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, the holders of the Notes may be able to require Teradyne to redeem some or all of the Notes either in discounted Teradyne common stock or in cash. On February 8, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a Registration Statement on Form S 3 covering both the Notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted. On December 19, 2001, Teradyne obtained a loan of approximately $45 million in the form of a 7.5% mortgage loan maturing on January 1, 2007, (the "Mortgage"). Principal payments are made according to a twenty year amortization schedule through December 2006, with the remaining principal due on January 1, 2007. Teradyne began making monthly principal and interest payments of $0.4 million on February 1, 2002. On October 26, 2001, Teradyne completed its acquisition of GenRad, Inc. of Westford, MA, a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment, related software and diagnostic solutions. GenRads business has been made part of the Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems operating segment. Under the terms of the acquisition, each outstanding share of GenRad common stock was converted into 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock. The total number of Teradyne shares exchanged for the shares of GenRad, based on the shares of GenRad outstanding as of the closing, was approximately 5.0 million. 21 The following table reflects Teradynes current contractual obligations: Non cancelable Convertible Mortgage Lease Senior Notes Notes Other Commitments Notes Payable Payable Debt Total (in thousands) 2002......... $ 24,019 $ 1,009 $6,557 $ 254 $ 31,839 2003......... 20,417 1,088 254 21,759 2004......... 17,532 1,172 254 18,958 2005......... 14,754 1,263 254 16,271 2006......... 10,490 $400,000 1,244 254 411,988 Beyond 2006.. 34,442 44,264 1,635 80,341 Total........ $121,654 $400,000 $50,040 $6,557 $2,905 $581,156 Teradyne believes its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance of $586.2 million, together with a tax refund of $85.2 million received in March 2002, will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions and funding requirements, Teradyne may seek additional external financing. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), "Business Combinations." SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling of interest method. In July 2001, FASB issued SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which is effective for Teradyne on January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles, and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill. In 2001, Teradyne recorded goodwill amortization of approximately $3.9 million. At December 31, 2001 Teradyne had $190.3 million of goodwill which will not be amortized. In 2002, Teradyne will record amortization of approximately $7.4 million relating to other intangibles primarily in connection with the GenRad acquisition. SFAS 142 also requires Teradyne to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption. Teradyne has completed a preliminary evaluation of the impact of SFAS 142 and currently does not expect to record a goodwill impairment. In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long Lived Assets." SFAS 143 provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. SFAS 143 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Teradyne has determined that SFAS 143 will not have an impact on its financial position and results of operations. In October 2001, FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS 144 requires one method of accounting for long lived assets disposed of by sale. SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Teradyne has adopted SFAS 144 effective January 1, 2002. SFAS 144 did not have an impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. 22 Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results From time to time, information provided by Teradyne, statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Form 10 K and Teradynes Annual Report to Shareholders) contain statements which are not purely historical facts, but are forward looking statements, made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, forward looking statements are contained in "Item 1: Business", and in "Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" relating to projections, plans, and objectives for Teradynes business, financial condition, operating results, future economic performance or statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital, planned capital expenditures, and expectations as to customer orders. Teradynes actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. Each of these factors, and others, are discussed from time to time in Teradynes filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Teradynes Business Is Impacted by the Slowdown in Economies Worldwide. Teradynes business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the economies of the United States, Asia and elsewhere that began in the second half of 2000. The uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investment and may cause further reduction of such investments. These reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which Teradyne serves and have contributed to Teradyne incurring losses in recent periods. Teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound, whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow, or if or when Teradyne will return to profitability. While Teradynes diverse business may allow it to perform better than some companies in periods of economic decline, the effects of the economic decline are being felt across all of Teradynes business segments and have significantly slowed customer orders. Teradynes Business is Dependent on the Current and Anticipated Market for Electronics. Teradynes business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. The current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of 2000 and the effects of the hostilities begun in September 2001. Historically, the electronic and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply, which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment, including systems manufactured and marketed by Teradyne. Teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that Teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations. Teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Teradyne cannot assure you that the downward trend in new orders will turn around in the future or that any increase in sales or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters. In addition, any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and operating results. Teradyne Has Taken and Expects to Continue to Take Measures to Address the Current Slowdown in the Market for Its Products Which Could Have Long term Negative Effects on Teradynes Business. Teradyne has taken and expects to take additional measures to address the current slowdown in the market for its products. In particular, Teradyne has reduced its workforce, frozen hiring, delayed salary increases, reduced the pay of substantially all employees, implemented furloughs, discontinued its Flash 750 memory product line, recorded asset impairment charges and reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense 23 budgets. These measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders. However, each measure Teradyne has taken and any additional measures taken in the future to contain expenditures could have long term negative effects on Teradynes business by reducing its pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in its products, and making it more difficult for Teradyne to respond to customers or competitors. Teradynes Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Acquisitions Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has acquired a number of businesses. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations. Such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks, including: . the possibility that one or more such acquisitions may not close due to closing conditions in the acquisition agreements, the inability to obtain regulatory approval, or the inability to meet conditions imposed for government or court approvals for the transaction; . the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; . the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; . the inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business; . the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business; . the possibility that Teradynes reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business; . potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business, including but not limited to regulatory, environmental and tax liabilities; . the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles, which may adversely affect Teradynes reported results of operations; and . litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions. For example, in connection with the August 2000 acquisition of each of Herco Technology Corp., a California company, and Perception Laminates, Inc., a California company, a complaint was filed by the former owners of those companies on or about September 5, 2001 naming as defendants Teradyne and two of its executive officers. This case is further described in "Item 3: Legal Proceedings" on this Form 10 K. Teradyne cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit at this time, and can give no assurance that it will not materially adversely affect Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In addition to the foregoing, any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to Teradynes expectations. Teradyne Currently Faces, and in the Future May Be the Subject of, Securities Class Action Litigation Due to Past or Future Stock Price Volatility. When the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock sometimes institute securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Currently, Teradyne and two if its executive officers are named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Boston, Massachusetts, on or about October 16, 2001, October 19, 2001 and November 7, 2001. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by making, during the period from July 14, 2000 until October 17, 2000, material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding Teradynes business operations and future prospects. The complaints seek unspecified damages, including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Teradyne strongly believes that the purported class action complaints lack merit and it intends to defend against the claims vigorously. However, Teradyne could 24 incur substantial costs defending the lawsuits. The lawsuits could also divert the time and attention of Teradynes management. Teradyne cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits at this time, and can give no assurance that they will not materially adversely affect Teradynes financial position or results of operations. Teradynes Business May be Adversely Impacted by Divestitures of Lines of Business Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has divested itself of certain lines of business. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional such divestitures. Such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks, including: . the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; . disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; . customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business; and . the decreased diversification of Teradynes product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make Teradynes operating results subject to increased market fluctuations. If Teradyne Is Unable to Protect Its Intellectual Property, Teradyne May Lose a Valuable Asset or May Incur Costly Litigation to Protect Its Rights. Teradynes products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets. While Teradyne believes that its patents, copyrights and trade secrets have value in general, no single one is in itself essential. At times, Teradyne has been notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against Teradyne, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products, or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results. If Teradyne Fails to Develop New Technologies to Adapt to Its Customers Needs and if Its Customers Fail to Accept Its New Products, Teradynes Revenues Will Be Adversely Affected. Teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers. Teradynes development of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products, and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to Teradynes success. Successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors, including: . new product selection; . development of competitive products by competitors; . timely and efficient completion of product design; . timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing; and . assembly processes and product performance at customer locations. Intense Competition in Teradynes Industry May Affect Its Revenues. Teradyne faces substantial competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments. Some of Teradynes competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers. Some of Teradynes competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those Teradyne currently offers. Teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New 25 product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of Teradynes products. Moreover, increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition, which could materially adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. Teradyne Is Subject to Risks of Operating Internationally. Teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the United States. Teradynes international sales are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including: . unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; . changes in tariffs and exchange rates; . political and economic instability and acts of terrorism; . difficulties in accounts receivable collection; . difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and . potentially adverse tax consequences, such as the World Trade Organizations dispute against the U.S. Foreign Sales Credit. Teradyne May Incur Significant Liabilities if It Fails to Comply With Environmental Regulations. Teradyne is subject to environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes. If Teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations, or is required to perform site remediation, Teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also: . restrict Teradynes ability to expand its facilities; . require Teradyne to acquire costly equipment; or . require Teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses. Teradyne Has Substantially Increased Its Indebtedness. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne completed a private placement of $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") due 2006 and received net proceeds of $389 million. On December 19, 2001, Teradyne obtained a loan of approximately $45 million in the form of a 7.5% mortgage loan maturing on January 1, 2007 (the "Mortgage"). As a result, Teradyne has incurred approximately $445 million principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization. Teradyne may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The level of Teradynes indebtedness, among other things, could: . make it difficult for Teradyne to make payments on its debt and other obligations; . make it difficult for Teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; . require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service for indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; . limit Teradynes flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, its business and the industries in which Teradyne competes; . place Teradyne at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and . make Teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in its business. There can be no assurance that Teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Mortgage. 26 Teradyne May Not Be Able to Satisfy a Change in Control Offer. The indenture governing the Notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of Teradyne. If someone triggers a change in control as defined in the indenture, Teradyne may be required to offer to purchase the Notes with cash. If Teradyne has to make that offer, Teradyne cannot be sure that it will have enough funds to pay for all the Notes that the holders could tender. In the event of a change in control of Teradyne, the mortgage lender may elect to declare all amounts due under the Mortgage to be immediately due and payable, and may elect to take possession of or sell the property subject to the Mortgage. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Pay Its Debt and Other Obligations. If Teradynes cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations, Teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems. If Teradyne is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes, the Mortgage, or certain of its other obligations, Teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness Teradyne may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, Teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the Notes or the Mortgage if payment of those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations. Moreover, Teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes or the Mortgage at their respective maturities. Teradyne May Need Additional Financing, Which Could Be Difficult to Obtain. Teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, the proceeds of the Notes offering in October 2001 and the proceeds from the Mortgage financing in December 2001, will be sufficient to meet Teradynes cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. In the event Teradyne may need to raise additional funds, Teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. Further, if Teradyne issues additional equity securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Future financings may place restrictions on how Teradyne operates its business. If Teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, Teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow its business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm Teradynes business. Provisions of Teradynes Charter and By Laws and Massachusetts Law Make a Takeover of Teradyne More Difficult. Teradynes basic corporate documents, its stockholder rights plan, and Massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of Teradyne, even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of Teradynes stockholders. Teradynes Operating Results Are Likely to Fluctuate Significantly. Teradynes quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability, including: . competitive pressures on selling prices; . the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of orders previously received; . provisions for excess and obsolete inventory; . changes in product mix; . Teradynes ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis; . the introduction of products and technologies by Teradynes competitors; 27 . market acceptance of Teradynes and its competitors products; . fulfilling backlog on a timely basis; . reliance on sole source suppliers; . potential retrofit costs; . the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter; and . the timing of investments in engineering and development. In particular, due to Teradynes introduction of a number of new, complex test systems in 2001 and the planned introduction of other such systems in 2002, there can be no assurance that Teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, Teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts, and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in European and Japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position and has in the past entered into forward contracts to hedge non U.S. currency forecasted transactions. Forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2001, the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy U.S. dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was $11.0 million. A 10% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $1.3 million. However, since these contracts hedge non U.S. currency assets and liabilities, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged. The hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at December 31, 2001 and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk Management At December 31, 2001, the fair value of outstanding short and long term marketable securities was approximately $270.0 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio would change the fair value by approximately $2.3 million. Market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for issues contained in the investment portfolio. 28 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include some amounts based on managements best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is consistent with that in the financial statements. Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal business controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly. The internal control system is augmented by appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business ethics applicable to all employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries. Management believes that Teradynes internal controls provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and other data and maintaining accountability for assets. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are not employees or officers of Teradyne, meets periodically with the independent accountants, internal auditors and management to discuss internal business controls, auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent accountants the scope and results of the audit. The Audit Committee also meets with the independent accountants without management present to ensure that the independent accountants have free access to the Audit Committee. The independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are engaged to audit the consolidated financial statements of Teradyne and to conduct such tests and related procedures as they deem necessary in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. The opinion of the independent accountants, based upon their audits of the consolidated financial statements, is contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. /S/ GEORGE W. CHAMILLARD George W.

Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" relating to projections, plans, and objectives for Teradynes business, financial condition, operating results, future economic performance or statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital, planned capital expenditures, and expectations as to customer orders. Teradynes actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. Each of these factors, and others, are discussed from time to time in Teradynes filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Teradynes Business Is Impacted by the Slowdown in Economies Worldwide. Teradynes business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the economies of the United States, Asia and elsewhere that began in the second half of 2000. The uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investment and may cause further reduction of such investments. These reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which Teradyne serves and have contributed to Teradyne incurring losses in recent periods. Teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound, whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow, or if or when Teradyne will return to profitability. While Teradynes diverse business may allow it to perform better than some companies in periods of economic decline, the effects of the economic decline are being felt across all of Teradynes business segments and have significantly slowed customer orders. Teradynes Business is Dependent on the Current and Anticipated Market for Electronics. Teradynes business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. The current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of 2000 and the effects of the hostilities begun in September 2001. Historically, the electronic and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply, which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment, including systems manufactured and marketed by Teradyne. Teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that Teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations. Teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Teradyne cannot assure you that the downward trend in new orders will turn around in the future or that any increase in sales or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters. In addition, any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and operating results. Teradyne Has Taken and Expects to Continue to Take Measures to Address the Current Slowdown in the Market for Its Products Which Could Have Long term Negative Effects on Teradynes Business. Teradyne has taken and expects to take additional measures to address the current slowdown in the market for its products. In particular, Teradyne has reduced its workforce, frozen hiring, delayed salary increases, reduced the pay of substantially all employees, implemented furloughs, discontinued its Flash 750 memory product line, recorded asset impairment charges and reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense 23 budgets. These measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders. However, each measure Teradyne has taken and any additional measures taken in the future to contain expenditures could have long term negative effects on Teradynes business by reducing its pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in its products, and making it more difficult for Teradyne to respond to customers or competitors. Teradynes Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Acquisitions Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has acquired a number of businesses. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations. Such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks, including: . the possibility that one or more such acquisitions may not close due to closing conditions in the acquisition agreements, the inability to obtain regulatory approval, or the inability to meet conditions imposed for government or court approvals for the transaction; . the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; . the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; . the inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business; . the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business; . the possibility that Teradynes reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business; . potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business, including but not limited to regulatory, environmental and tax liabilities; . the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles, which may adversely affect Teradynes reported results of operations; and . litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions. For example, in connection with the August 2000 acquisition of each of Herco Technology Corp., a California company, and Perception Laminates, Inc., a California company, a complaint was filed by the former owners of those companies on or about September 5, 2001 naming as defendants Teradyne and two of its executive officers. This case is further described in "Item 3: Legal Proceedings" on this Form 10 K. Teradyne cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit at this time, and can give no assurance that it will not materially adversely affect Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In addition to the foregoing, any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to Teradynes expectations. Teradyne Currently Faces, and in the Future May Be the Subject of, Securities Class Action Litigation Due to Past or Future Stock Price Volatility. When the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock sometimes institute securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Currently, Teradyne and two if its executive officers are named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Boston, Massachusetts, on or about October 16, 2001, October 19, 2001 and November 7, 2001. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by making, during the period from July 14, 2000 until October 17, 2000, material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding Teradynes business operations and future prospects. The complaints seek unspecified damages, including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Teradyne strongly believes that the purported class action complaints lack merit and it intends to defend against the claims vigorously. However, Teradyne could 24 incur substantial costs defending the lawsuits. The lawsuits could also divert the time and attention of Teradynes management. Teradyne cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits at this time, and can give no assurance that they will not materially adversely affect Teradynes financial position or results of operations. Teradynes Business May be Adversely Impacted by Divestitures of Lines of Business Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has divested itself of certain lines of business. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional such divestitures. Such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks, including: . the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; . disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; . customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business; and . the decreased diversification of Teradynes product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make Teradynes operating results subject to increased market fluctuations. If Teradyne Is Unable to Protect Its Intellectual Property, Teradyne May Lose a Valuable Asset or May Incur Costly Litigation to Protect Its Rights. Teradynes products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets. While Teradyne believes that its patents, copyrights and trade secrets have value in general, no single one is in itself essential. At times, Teradyne has been notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against Teradyne, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products, or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results. If Teradyne Fails to Develop New Technologies to Adapt to Its Customers Needs and if Its Customers Fail to Accept Its New Products, Teradynes Revenues Will Be Adversely Affected. Teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers. Teradynes development of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products, and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to Teradynes success. Successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors, including: . new product selection; . development of competitive products by competitors; . timely and efficient completion of product design; . timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing; and . assembly processes and product performance at customer locations. Intense Competition in Teradynes Industry May Affect Its Revenues. Teradyne faces substantial competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments. Some of Teradynes competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers. Some of Teradynes competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those Teradyne currently offers. Teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New 25 product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of Teradynes products. Moreover, increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition, which could materially adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. Teradyne Is Subject to Risks of Operating Internationally. Teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the United States. Teradynes international sales are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including: . unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; . changes in tariffs and exchange rates; . political and economic instability and acts of terrorism; . difficulties in accounts receivable collection; . difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and . potentially adverse tax consequences, such as the World Trade Organizations dispute against the U.S. Foreign Sales Credit. Teradyne May Incur Significant Liabilities if It Fails to Comply With Environmental Regulations. Teradyne is subject to environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes. If Teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations, or is required to perform site remediation, Teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also: . restrict Teradynes ability to expand its facilities; . require Teradyne to acquire costly equipment; or . require Teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses. Teradyne Has Substantially Increased Its Indebtedness. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne completed a private placement of $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") due 2006 and received net proceeds of $389 million. On December 19, 2001, Teradyne obtained a loan of approximately $45 million in the form of a 7.5% mortgage loan maturing on January 1, 2007 (the "Mortgage"). As a result, Teradyne has incurred approximately $445 million principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization. Teradyne may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The level of Teradynes indebtedness, among other things, could: . make it difficult for Teradyne to make payments on its debt and other obligations; . make it difficult for Teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; . require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service for indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; . limit Teradynes flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, its business and the industries in which Teradyne competes; . place Teradyne at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and . make Teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in its business. There can be no assurance that Teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Mortgage. 26 Teradyne May Not Be Able to Satisfy a Change in Control Offer. The indenture governing the Notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of Teradyne. If someone triggers a change in control as defined in the indenture, Teradyne may be required to offer to purchase the Notes with cash. If Teradyne has to make that offer, Teradyne cannot be sure that it will have enough funds to pay for all the Notes that the holders could tender. In the event of a change in control of Teradyne, the mortgage lender may elect to declare all amounts due under the Mortgage to be immediately due and payable, and may elect to take possession of or sell the property subject to the Mortgage. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Pay Its Debt and Other Obligations. If Teradynes cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations, Teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems. If Teradyne is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes, the Mortgage, or certain of its other obligations, Teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness Teradyne may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, Teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the Notes or the Mortgage if payment of those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations. Moreover, Teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes or the Mortgage at their respective maturities. Teradyne May Need Additional Financing, Which Could Be Difficult to Obtain. Teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, the proceeds of the Notes offering in October 2001 and the proceeds from the Mortgage financing in December 2001, will be sufficient to meet Teradynes cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. In the event Teradyne may need to raise additional funds, Teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. Further, if Teradyne issues additional equity securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Future financings may place restrictions on how Teradyne operates its business. If Teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, Teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow its business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm Teradynes business. Provisions of Teradynes Charter and By Laws and Massachusetts Law Make a Takeover of Teradyne More Difficult. Teradynes basic corporate documents, its stockholder rights plan, and Massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of Teradyne, even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of Teradynes stockholders. Teradynes Operating Results Are Likely to Fluctuate Significantly. Teradynes quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability, including: . competitive pressures on selling prices; . the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of orders previously received; . provisions for excess and obsolete inventory; . changes in product mix; . Teradynes ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis; . the introduction of products and technologies by Teradynes competitors; 27 . market acceptance of Teradynes and its competitors products; . fulfilling backlog on a timely basis; . reliance on sole source suppliers; . potential retrofit costs; . the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter; and . the timing of investments in engineering and development. In particular, due to Teradynes introduction of a number of new, complex test systems in 2001 and the planned introduction of other such systems in 2002, there can be no assurance that Teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, Teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts, and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in European and Japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position and has in the past entered into forward contracts to hedge non U.S. currency forecasted transactions. Forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2001, the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy U.S. dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was $11.0 million. A 10% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $1.3 million. However, since these contracts hedge non U.S. currency assets and liabilities, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged. The hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at December 31, 2001 and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk Management At December 31, 2001, the fair value of outstanding short and long term marketable securities was approximately $270.0 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio would change the fair value by approximately $2.3 million. Market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for issues contained in the investment portfolio. 28 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include some amounts based on managements best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is consistent with that in the financial statements. Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal business controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly. The internal control system is augmented by appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business ethics applicable to all employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries. Management believes that Teradynes internal controls provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and other data and maintaining accountability for assets. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are not employees or officers of Teradyne, meets periodically with the independent accountants, internal auditors and management to discuss internal business controls, auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent accountants the scope and results of the audit. The Audit Committee also meets with the independent accountants without management present to ensure that the independent accountants have free access to the Audit Committee. The independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are engaged to audit the consolidated financial statements of Teradyne and to conduct such tests and related procedures as they deem necessary in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. The opinion of the independent accountants, based upon their audits of the consolidated financial statements, is contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. /S/ GEORGE W. CHAMILLARD George W.
