Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of Teradynes plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Teradynes actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in "Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results" and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Teradyne to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, Teradyne evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, 16 contingencies and litigation. Teradyne bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. It is Teradynes policy to require an arrangement with its customers, either in the form of a written or electronic contract or purchase order containing all of the terms and conditions governing the arrangement, prior to the recognition of revenue. Title and risk of loss generally passes to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier. At the time of the transaction, Teradyne assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms of the arrangement. If a significant portion of the sales price is not due within normal payment terms, the sales price may not be deemed fixed and revenue would be recognized as the amounts become due. Teradyne does not offer a right of return on its products. Teradyne assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer. Teradyne performs on going credit evaluations of its customers financial condition but generally does not require collateral from its customers. If Teradyne determines that collectibility of the sales price is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment from the customer. Revenue is recognized upon delivery provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, Teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. Teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. In order to recognize revenue the functionality of the undelivered elements must not be essential to the delivered elements. Installation is not considered essential to the functionality of the product as these services do not alter the product capabilities, do not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. In addition to installation, other elements may include extended warranties, customer support and undelivered products. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. Teradynes products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of sales when product revenue is recognized. Interconnection systems and electronic manufacturing assembly services revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under Statement of Accounting Position No. 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts," revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon an efforts expended method. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which determined. To date revenue under contract accounting has not been material. Inventories Inventories which include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to 17 evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a full valuation allowance. Until an appropriate level of profitability is reached, Teradyne does not expect to recognize tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets Teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors Teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of Teradynes use of the acquired asset, a change in the strategy for Teradynes overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. When Teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, Teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. Teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually, on a reporting basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The volatility of the industries that Teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows, which can impact their ability to make required payments. Teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customers current payment history, the customers current financial statements and other information regarding the customers credit worthiness. If the financial condition of Teradynes customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 18 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (dollars in thousands) Percentage of net sales: Net Revenue: Products.................................................................... 81.2% 85.6% 92.9% Service..................................................................... 18.8 14.4 7.1 Total net revenue....................................................... 100.0 100.0 100.0 Expenses: Cost of products............................................................ 67.9 70.5 48.3 Cost of service............................................................. 13.1 10.1 4.5 Total cost of sales..................................................... 81.0 80.6 52.8 Engineering and development................................................. 24.0 20.0 11.4 Selling and administrative.................................................. 23.8 18.7 12.4 Restructuring and other charges............................................. 16.7 5.2 145.5 124.5 76.6 Net interest and other (expense) income........................................

(58.8)% (14.0)% 14.9% Results of Operations: 2002 compared to 2001 Business Overview Teradyne saw an encouraging start to 2002, as first quarter sales were up 13% over the fourth quarter of 2001, followed by 25% quarter to quarter growth in the second quarter. Net sales growth slowed to 7% in the third quarter followed by flat quarter to quarter performance in the fourth quarter. The combination of a continued weak economy, weak demand for technology products, and the uncertain world political environment overwhelmed the recovery that appeared to be starting early in the year. As of the end of 2002, Teradynes customers in general have lowered their inventory levels and reduced their overall cost structures, resulting in improved quarterly financial performance. Additionally, utilization of Teradynes semiconductor test equipment, and semiconductor test equipment in general, has increased over the last year. This has resulted from increased volumes of units shipped by Teradynes Semiconductor industry customers. These are generally signs of potential increases in demand for Teradynes products. However, a number of Teradynes customers continue to lose money, although at a reduced rate. In the Semiconductor industry, this is occurring as decreased unit prices have offset the unit volume gains. As a result, Teradynes customers continue to defer orders until the last possible moment. Until Teradynes customers see significant and sustained increases in their business levels, both in units and dollars, Teradynes orders could remain low or see a further decline. If Teradyne sees further declines in its own order rates, the amount of Teradynes inventory and certain long lived assets considered realizable could be significantly reduced. 19 Bookings Net orders increased 12% to $905.3 million in 2002 from $808.2 million in 2001. Net orders increased by 63% and 65% in Semiconductor Test Systems and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, respectively. Connection Systems net orders decreased by 61%. The increase in Semiconductor orders was driven by increased demand for SOC products by Teradynes Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) and Subcon customers, primarily for use in Asian facilities. The increase in orders for Circuit Board Test and Inspection largely resulted from the full year impact of the GenRad acquisition. The decrease in Connection System orders reflects the impact of cancellations, which are described in the next paragraph. Other Test Systems net orders increased 286%, mostly due to the addition of a full year of activity from Diagnostic Solutions that was part of the GenRad acquisition. Teradyne experienced cancellations of $159.0 million and $285.5 million during 2002 and 2001, respectively. For 2002, cancellations of $53 million and $105 million occurred in the Semiconductor Test Systems and Connection System businesses, respectively. The Semiconductor Test Systems cancellations were largely for orders that were booked in late 2000 and early 2001 by Subcons in anticipation of further increases in their own demand. Cancellations in the Connection Systems business were from major customers in the telecommunication and information technology infrastructure industries, as their own demand levels dropped. Teradynes net orders for its four principal operating segments for 2002 and 2001 were as follows: (in millions) 2002 2001 Semiconductor Test Systems............... $480.5 $294.0 Connection Systems....................... 149.8 385.0 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 167.8 101.4 Other Test Systems....................... 107.2 27.8 $905.3 $808.2 Teradynes net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings were as follows: 2002 2001 United States.... 44% 55% South East Asia.. 19 12 Europe........... 18 24 Japan............ 9 3 Taiwan........... 6 3 Korea............ 2 1 Rest of the World 2 2 100% 100% Teradynes backlog decreased 42% to $440.9 million in 2002 from $763.0 million in 2001. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments was as follows: (in millions) 2002 2001 Semiconductor Test Systems............... $240.0 $317.2 Connection Systems....................... 104.2 357.6 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 53.4 55.5 Other Test Systems....................... 43.3 32.7 $440.9 $763.0 20 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, Teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business and results of operations. Revenue Teradynes four principal operating segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net sales for each of last three years: % of consolidated net sales 2002 2001 2000 Semiconductor Test Systems............... 46% 50% 67% Connection Systems....................... 32 38 24 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 14 9 5 Other Test Systems....................... 8 3 4 Total.................................... 100% 100% 100% Teradynes sales by region as a percentage of total sales were as follows: 2002 2001 United States........................... 46% 51% Europe.................................. 18 19 South East Asia......................... 17 12 Taiwan.................................. 9 10 Japan................................... 6 4 Korea................................... 2 1 Rest of the World....................... 2 3 100 % 100 % Product sales decreased 20% in 2002 to $992.1 million from $1,233.7 million in 2001. Service revenue increased largely due to the GenRad acquisition to $230.1 million in 2002 from $206.9 million in 2001. Service revenue is derived from the servicing of Teradynes installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, customer support, extended warranties and parts sales. Semiconductor Test Systems sales decreased 22%, to $557.6 million in 2002 from $717.7 million in 2001, Connection Systems sales decreased 27%, to $397.0 million in 2002 from $540.8 million in 2001, and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems sales increased 29%, to $170.8 million in 2002 from $132.4 million in 2001. Other Test Systems sales increased 95%, to $96.9 million in 2002 from $49.7 million in 2001. Year to year increases in sales for Teradynes Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems and Other Test Systems largely resulted from the full year impact of the acquisition of GenRad during the fourth quarter of 2001. Of the decrease in Semiconductor Test System sales, $98.7 million was due to the accounting impact of the implementation of SAB 101, which is further described in the next paragraph. The Connection Systems business saw downward pricing pressure during 2002, as the average selling prices declined by approximately 15% due to price pressures from both customers and competitors in the face of a weak economy. Additionally, year to year results for Teradynes Semiconductor and Connection Systems businesses were impacted by 2001s steady decline in quarterly sales, which was followed by a recovery to approximately the current run rate levels in the first half of 2002. The relatively stronger first half of 2001, which followed Teradynes record sales year of 2000, further contributed to annual results for 2001 that exceeded 2002 for these businesses. 21 During the fourth quarter of 2000, Teradyne implemented Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB 101) retroactive to the beginning of the year. Included in 2001 sales was $98.7 million related to shipments of customer orders in 2000 where title was retained by Teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security interest. Teradyne no longer retains title until customer payment. In 2002 and 2001, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales. In 2002 and 2001, Teradynes three largest customers accounted for 23% and 24% of consolidated net sales, respectively. Gross Margin Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 19.0% in 2002 from 19.4% in 2001. The decrease in the gross margin rate in 2002 compared to 2001 was affected by the following items: Rate Differential 2002 charges described below.......................................................... (3.7)% 2001 charges described below.......................................................... 9.7 Higher gross margins on revenue orginally recorded in 2000 which was reversed and recorded in 2001 because title did not pass until payment*.......................... (3.0) Decreased utilization of Teradynes manufacturing overhead, as sales volume decreased while certain components of cost of sales remained fixed............................ (1.8) Primarily related to price pressures described above, net of favorable product mix and product cost reduction activities................................................... (1.6) Total................................................................................ (0.4) * This accounting change impacted 2001 as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2002, an excess and obsolete inventory provision of $39.0 million was recorded in cost of sales of which $20.7 million related to the lack of demand for the Probe One product and the discontinuance of the J996 product after a last time buy offer to Teradynes customers. Additionally, due to consolidating and downsizing of manufacturing locations, approximately $5.7 million of incremental accelerated depreciation was classified in cost of sales. During 2001, Teradyne recorded a provision of $139.7 million for excess and obsolete inventory including discontinued product lines. The total inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory, excluding the discontinued product lines, was $105.2 million in 2001 and was principally due to the sharp decline in incoming Semiconductor Test Systems and Connection Systems orders. During the third quarter of 2001, Teradyne recorded a charge of $32.3 million related to an inventory writedown for the discontinuance of its Flash 750 memory product. Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 24% in 2002 from 20% in 2001, with spending increasing by $6.6 million. The increase in spending was primarily due to the additional expense base resulting from Teradynes purchase of GenRad in the fourth quarter of 2001 which increased spending by approximately $23.0 million and to a lesser extent the granting of the prior years previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of 2002 which increased spending by approximately $6.0 million. The additional engineering and development expense was partially offset by reductions in discretionary spending across all of Teradynes engineering groups which decreased spending by approximately $23.2 million. As described in the Gross Margin section above, Teradyne recorded a charge for incremental accelerated depreciation of $0.8 million which is classified in Engineering and Development. 22 Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses increased to 24% of sales in 2002 from 19% of sales in 2001, with spending increasing by $20.3 million. The increase in spending was principally due to additional expenses resulting from Teradynes purchase of GenRad in the fourth quarter of 2001, with an additional increase coming from the granting of the prior years previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of 2002. The additional selling and administrative expense was partially offset by workforce reductions and reductions in discretionary spending. As described in the Gross Margin section above, Teradyne recorded a charge for incremental accelerated depreciation of $1.1 million which is classified in Selling and Administrative. Restructuring and Other Charges The table below summarizes activity for the year ended December 31, 2002, relating to restructuring and other charges: Goodwill and Severance Intangible Fixed Asset Facility and Asset Impairment Impairment Related Benefits Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2001.... $ $ $ 1,676 $ 13,523 $ 15,199 2002 provision.................. 86,196 69,734 25,751 22,495 204,176 Cash payments...................

(35,338) (35,338) Balance at December 31, 2001......................... $ $ 1,676 $ 13,523 $ 15,199 During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded $86.2 million in goodwill and intangibles impairment charges. SFAS 142 provides that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances including a significant adverse change in the business outlook. During the third quarter of 2002, as a result of significant change in the business outlook, Teradyne tested the goodwill related to the Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems segment for impairment as of September 29, 2002. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems segment exceeded its fair value. In the third quarter of 2002, Teradyne recognized a $78.5 million goodwill impairment charge. The impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems segment to its carrying value. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradynes management concluded, in accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," that certain long lived assets held for sale were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets, and recorded charges of $69.7 million. The charge for the Connection Systems segment included $25.6 million 23 relating to a held for sale printed circuit board facility in San Diego, California, $2.6 million relating to a held for sale facility in Nashua, New Hampshire, and $17.9 million primarily related to manufacturing equipment which was taken out of service during 2002 and is held for sale. The Semiconductor Test Systems segment recorded a charge of $12.0 million primarily for assets held for sale as a result of the lack of demand for the Probe One product and the discontinuance of the J996 product after a last time buy offer to our customers, a charge of $9.7 million related to the write down of manufacturing facilities that are held for sale in California, and $0.8 million related to the write down of foundry manufacturing equipment that are held for sale. In addition, an asset impairment charge was recorded of $1.1 million related to a Corporate facility sold in the first quarter of 2003. Teradyne expects the sale of these held for sale assets to occur within a year. The carrying value of Teradynes assets held for sale is $45.3 million as of December 31, 2002. These assets are included in Property, Plant, and Equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2001, Teradyne recorded a charge of $35.3 million for impaired long lived assets, consisting of the following: $12.0 million for a held for sale facility in the Connection Systems segment, certain impaired manufacturing assets in the Connection Systems segment of $15.4 million, and equipment manufactured by Teradyne used in manufacturing and engineering and development relating to the discontinuance of the Flash 750 product line in Semiconductor Test Systems segment of $7.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a charge of $25.8 million relating to future lease commitments for vacated manufacturing and administrative space which will be exited prior to the end of the lease term. The charge of $25.8 million includes $18.8 million at Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, $5.0 million at Connection Systems and $2.0 million at Semiconductor Test Systems. The lease accruals are expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Teradyne recorded charges for vacated office space under operating leases at Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems of $1.7 million. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and long term other accrued liabilities. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during 2002 of $22.5 million. There were approximately 1,010 employees terminated across all functional groups during 2002. All remaining severance benefits payable to these employees will be paid by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during 2001 of $37.3 million. There were approximately 2,900 employees terminated across all functional groups during 2001. As of December 31, 2002, Teradyne has paid all severance benefits relating to the 2001 terminations. The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings. The restructuring actions taken during 2002 are expected to generate cost savings of approximately $88 million annually across all areas of operations. In connection with its restructuring plan for GenRad in 2002, Teradyne recorded $4.3 million of additional goodwill relating to the finalization of its involuntary termination plan and recorded $2.2 million of additional goodwill relating to the completion of facility exit plans for GenRad operating locations. The table below summarizes activity relating to GenRad employee termination and facility closure costs (in thousands): Severance Facility and Benefits Related Total Balance at December 31, 2001 $ 1,006 $ $ 1,006 Employee termination costs.. 4,289 4,289 Leased facility costs....... 2,167 2,167 Cash payments............... (4,970) (450) (5,420) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 325 $1,717 $ 2,042 24 During the first quarter of 2003, Teradyne had a reduction in workforce of approximately 295 people. The estimated severance charge from this reduction in personnel totals approximately $6.0 million. Interest income and expense Interest income decreased by $5.8 million to $17.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The decreases in interest income were attributable to lower interest rates. Interest expense increased by $17.7 million to $21.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to interest expense related to convertible notes which Teradyne issued in the fourth quarter of 2001. Other income and expense, net Other income and expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 includes the following: Gain/(loss) 2002 2001 (in thousands) Repayment of loan by divested entity (1).................. $ 7,144 Other than temporary impairment of common stock investment (3,115) Writedown of investment in an engineering service provider (2,288) $(1,800) Fair value adjustment on warrants.........................

(6,974) Total..................................................... $ (310) $ 8,040 (1) The loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection. (2) Teradynes proportionate share of a loss related to an equity investment in Empirix, Inc. The carrying value of this equity investment was zero at December 31, 2002 and 2001. (Loss) income before taxes (Loss) income before income taxes was a loss of $560.9 million in 2002 compared to a loss of $326.2 million in 2001. Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems, and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems loss before income taxes increased $18.1 million, $56.6 million, and $158.9 million, respectively in 2002 due to decreased sales in Semiconductor Test Systems and Connection Systems, goodwill and intangible asset impairments in Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems and the market conditions described above. Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased $4.7 million due to the addition of Diagnostics Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the GenRad acquisition. Income taxes For the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision of $157.5 million resulting in a tax rate of 28%. The tax rate of 28% is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized. Until an appropriate level of profitability is reached, Teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations. The effective tax rate benefit for the year ended 2001 was 38%. Teradynes effective tax rate for the year ended 2001 primarily reflects the U.S. statutory income tax rate, the net effect of state taxes and the effect of tax benefits from its Ireland manufacturing operations. Tax exemptions relating to Ireland operations are effective through 2010. 25 2001 compared to 2000 Bookings Net orders decreased 76% to $808.2 million in 2001 from $3,320.9 million in 2000. Net orders decreased in all operating segments and were led by a 85% decrease in Semiconductor Test Systems net orders. Connection Systems net orders, Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems net orders, and Other Test Systems net orders decreased 64%, 33%, and 78%, respectively. Teradyne experienced cancellations of $285.5 million during 2001. Teradynes net orders for its four principal operating segments for 2001 and 2000 were as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 Semiconductor Test Systems............... $294.0 $1,960.5 Connection Systems....................... 385.0 1,082.0 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 101.4 151.6 Other Test Systems....................... 27.8 126.8 $808.2 $3,320.9 Teradynes backlog decreased 45% to $763.0 million in 2001 from $1,382.1 million in 2000. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments was as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 Semiconductor Test Systems............... $317.2 $ 742.1 Connection Systems....................... 357.6 534.4 Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems 55.5 68.4 Other Test Systems....................... 32.7 37.2 $763.0 $1,382.1 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, Teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business and results of operations. Revenue Product sales decreased 56% in 2001 to $1,233.7 million from $2,828.9 million in 2000. Service revenue declined slightly in 2001 to $206.9 million from $215.1 million in 2000 as the overall business declined. Semiconductor Test Systems sales decreased 65%, to $717.7 million in 2001 from $2,044.3 million in 2000, Connection Systems sales decreased 26%, to $540.8 million in 2001 from $734.6 million in 2000, and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems sales decreased 6%, to $132.4 million in 2001 from $141.2 million in 2000. These decreases reflect the overall economic and industry market conditions described below. Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems sales include the two month impact of the GenRad acquisition which contributed sales of $19.0 million. Other Test Systems sales decreased 60%, to $49.7 million in 2001 from $124.1 million in 2000, which principally reflects the divestiture of Software Test Systems at the end of 2000 as well as the overall economic and industry market conditions described below. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Teradyne implemented Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB 101) retroactive to the beginning of the year. Included in 2001 sales was $98.7 million related to shipments of customer orders in 2000 where title was retained by Teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security interest. Teradyne no longer retains title until customer payment. 26 Teradynes business has been adversely impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide including the effects of the hostilities begun in September 2001. Teradyne has also been adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the electronics and semiconductor industries, which experience recurring periods of oversupply of products and equipment of the type Teradyne sells. These factors have resulted in a downturn in the demand for Teradynes products. During 2001, orders declined significantly across all of Teradynes product lines when compared with the orders Teradyne received during 2000. In 2001 and 2000, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales. In 2001, Teradynes three largest customers accounted for 24% of consolidated net sales. Gross Margin Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 19.4% in 2001 from 47.2% in 2000. The percentage decrease in 2001 was attributable to the decreased utilization of Teradynes manufacturing capacity, as sales volume decreased while certain components of costs of sales remained fixed and additional inventory provisions. The decrease in the percentage of gross margin was also impacted to a lesser extent by increased competitive price pressure as current semiconductor products mature and the mix of Teradynes business changes as Connection Systems and Circuit Board Test and Inspection System sales, which have lower gross margins, become a larger percentage of Teradynes business. Inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was $105.2 million in 2001, which excludes the inventory writedowns for product line discontinuance, compared to $27.5 million in 2000, included in cost of sales. The increase in the inventory provision was caused by the worldwide economic slowdown during 2001. Between 2000 and 2001, orders declined by approximately $2,512.7 million, a 76% decrease. This drop in orders combined with lead time requirements for inventory procurement and Teradynes new product introduction plans necessitated additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory. During 2001, Teradyne recorded an inventory writedown in Semiconductor Test Systems due to the discontinuance of the Flash 750 product line of $32.3 million. Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 20% in 2001 from 11% in 2000, with spending decreasing by $60.7 million. This spending decrease was primarily due to lower prototype material costs and the impact of workforce reductions, salary cuts, and furloughs in Semiconductor Test Systems and Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, excluding the impact of the GenRad acquisition. Connection Systems engineering and development spending increased 5% from 2000 to 2001. Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses increased to 19% of sales in 2001 from 12% of sales in 2000, with spending decreasing by $107.7 million. The decrease in spending was principally due to certain cost containment programs such as workforce reductions, salary cuts, and furloughs. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges include a workforce reduction and early retirement provision of $37.3 million, a charge of $15.4 million for certain impaired manufacturing assets at Connection Systems, a charge for a Connection Systems impaired facility of $12.0 million, a charge for impaired assets of $7.9 million relating to the discontinuance of the Flash 750 product line in Semiconductor Test Systems, and a charge for vacated space under certain operating leases of $1.7 million in Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems. There were approximately 2,900 employees terminated in 2001 across all functional groups. All severance benefits for employees terminated in 2001 were paid by the fourth quarter of 2002. 27 Below is a table summarizing activity relating to restructuring and other charges: Severance Fixed Asset Facility and Impairment Related Benefits Total (in thousands) 2001 provision.............. $ 35,338 $1,676 $ 37,278 $ 74,292 Cash payments............... (23,755) (23,755) Asset write downs........... (35,338) (35,338) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ $1,676 $ 13,523 $ 15,199 The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings and the accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities. Interest income and expense Interest income decreased by $2.4 million to $22.7 million in 2001 compared to $25.1 million in 2000. The decrease in 2001 was attributable to decreases in the average invested balances and lower interest rates. Interest expense increased by $2.3 million as a result of interest expense for two months associated with Teradynes convertible notes. Other income and expense Included in other income in 2001 is a gain from the sale of Connections Systems aerospace and defense business of $14.8 million. Included in other expense for 2001 is Teradynes proportionate share of a loss related to an equity method investment of $7.0 million. (Loss) income before taxes (Loss) income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was a loss of $326.2 million in 2001 compared to income of $739.6 million in 2000. Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems, Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems, and Other Test Systems income before income taxes decreased $923.3 million, $178.0 million, $43.2 million, and $4.0 million, respectively in 2001 due to decreased sales in each group and the market conditions described above. Income taxes Teradynes effective tax rate benefit was 38% in 2001. The effective tax rate provision for the year ended 2000 was 30%. The change in the tax rate is a result of a loss in 2001. In 2000, Teradyne was able to reduce its effective tax rate with tax benefits from its foreign sales corporation and Ireland manufacturing operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $45.2 million in 2002, to $541.1 million. Teradyne used cash from operating activities of $4.2 million in 2002 and $79.0 million in 2001 and generated cash from operating activities in 2000 of $470.9 million. Net income (loss), adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash items, used cash of $241.9 million in 2002, used cash of $74.0 million in 2001, and provided cash of $501.6 million in 2000. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses sold and acquired provided cash of $237.7 million in 2002 primarily due to decreased inventory balances and the receipt of a tax refund of $85.2 million in March 2002. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $5.0 million in 2001 and used cash of $30.7 million in 2000. 28 Teradyne used $102.2 million of cash for investing activities in 2002, $247.3 million in 2001, and $312.3 million in 2000. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, cash acquired in business acquisitions, cash paid for assets, and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures decreased by $165.1 million in 2002 compared with 2001, across all operating segments but primarily in the Connection Systems segment. This was due to the actions taken by Teradyne in 2002 to reduce planned capital expenditures due to current market conditions. Capital expenditures were $76.4 million in 2002, $241.4 million in 2001, and $298.2 million in 2000. Teradyne obtained $40.4 million of cash from financing activities in 2002, obtained $401.5 million in 2001, and used $97.5 million in 2000. Financing activities include the issuance of convertible notes, mortgage borrowings, sales and repurchases of Teradynes common stock, as well as repayments of debt. In 2001, Teradyne assumed debt of $89.7 million from the GenRad acquisition which Teradyne repaid on October 26, 2001. During 2002, 2001, and 2000 issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $41.2 million, $58.5 million, and $55.3 million, respectively. Teradyne used cash for the acquisition of treasury stock of $147.5 million in 2000. Since 1996, Teradyne has used $540.8 million of cash to repurchase 20.0 million shares of its common stock on the open market though no cash was used in 2002 and 2001 to repurchase shares of common stock. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne issued $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 (the "Notes") in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. The Notes are redeemable by Teradyne at any time after October 18, 2004 at specified prices. Teradyne began making annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Teradyne that rank equally with Teradynes existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In the event of a change in control by which Teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, the holders of the Notes may be able to require Teradyne to redeem some or all of the Notes either in discounted Teradyne common stock or in cash. On February 8, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a Registration Statement on Form S 3 covering both the Notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted. On December 19, 2001, Teradyne obtained a loan of approximately $45 million in the form of a 7.5% mortgage loan maturing on January 1, 2007, (the "Mortgage"). Principal payments are made according to a twenty year amortization schedule through December 2006, with the remaining principal due on January 1, 2007. Teradyne began making monthly principal and interest payments of $0.4 million on February 1, 2002. On October 26, 2001, Teradyne completed its acquisition of GenRad, Inc. of Westford, MA, a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment, related software and diagnostic solutions. GenRads business has been made part of the Circuit Board Test and Inspection Systems operating segment excluding the Diagnostic Solutions business. Diagnostic Solutions has been made part of the Other Test Systems operating segment. Under the terms of the acquisition, each outstanding share of GenRad common stock was converted into 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock. The total number of Teradyne shares exchanged for the shares of GenRad, based on the shares of GenRad outstanding as of the closing, was approximately 5.0 million. 29 The following table reflects Teradynes current contractual obligations: Non cancelable Convertible Mortgage Lease Interest Senior Notes Notes Other Commitments on Debt* Notes Payable Payable Debt Total (in thousands) 2003....... $ 23,843 $18,468 $ 1,088 $6,704 $ 277 $ 50,380 2004....... 20,450 18,380 1,172 277 40,279 2005....... 17,592 18,284 1,263 277 37,416 2006....... 13,004 17,936 $400,000 1,244 277 432,461 2007....... 10,840 671 39,224 277 51,012 Beyond 2007 19,993 865 5,040 1,510 27,408 TOTAL...... $105,722 $74,604 $400,000 $49,031 $6,704 $2,895 $638,956 * Includes interest on convertible notes. Teradyne believes its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance of $541.1 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twenty four months. Depending on market conditions and funding requirements, Teradyne may seek additional external financing. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Employee Stock Options Teradynes equity compensation program is a broad based, long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Teradyne considers its equity compensation program critical to Teradynes operation and productivity. Approximately 80% of Teradynes employees participate in its equity compensation program. Of the stock options Teradyne granted in 2002, 89% went to employees other than the Chief Executive Officer and the five other most highly compensated executive officers.

(2) Potential Realizable Value at Assumed Annual Rates of Stock Price Appreciation for Option Term. Amounts reported in these columns represent amounts that may be realized upon exercise of the options immediately prior to the expiration of their term assuming the specified compounded rates of appreciation (5% and 10%) of Teradynes common stock over the term of the options. These numbers are calculated based on rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not reflect Teradynes 31 estimate of future stock price increases. Actual gains, if any, on stock option exercises and common stock holdings are dependent on the timing of such exercise and the future performance of Teradynes common stock. There can be no assurance that the rates of appreciation assumed in this table can be achieved or that the amounts reflected will be received by the individuals.

Except for the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of the foregoing plans was approved by Teradynes shareholders. The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2002: (1) (2) (3) Number of securities Number of securities remaining to be issued upon Weighted average available for future issuance exercise of exercise price of under stock option compensation outstanding options, outstanding options, plans (excluding securities Plan category warrants, and rights warrants, and rights reflected in column(1)) (Shares in thousands) Stock option plans approved by shareholders.................... 6,719 $21.78 3,804 Stock option plans not approved by shareholders(1)................. 26,124 $22.70 21,214 Total............................. 32,843 $22.51 25,018 (1) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the "Acquisition"), Teradyne assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan 32 (collectively, the "GenRad Plans"). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of Teradyne common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock for each share of GenRad common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2002, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 578 shares of Teradyne common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $74.77 per share. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1991 Plan") Under the 1991 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options which qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("ISOs") and non qualified stock options ("NQOs"), up to a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. ISOs may be granted only to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries and NQOs may be granted to employees, consultants and directors who are also employees of Teradyne. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 200,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted options to purchase, in the aggregate, more than 300,000 shares of common stock under the 1991 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1991 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an option whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the option, its exercise price and other pertinent terms, including vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each option may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees option may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1991 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2011. The 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan") Under the 1997 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue ISOs to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries, and NQOs, stock awards and authorizations to purchase Teradyne common stock to employees, consultants or directors (provided that no options may be granted to non employee directors) up to a maximum of 53,000,000 shares. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 400,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted an option to acquire more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1997 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an award, the pertinent terms of such award, including, if such award is an option, whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the award, its exercise price and vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each award may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees award may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1997 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2007. Options granted prior to September 2001 under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of five years. Beginning in September 2001, options granted under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of seven years. In addition, Teradyne made a one time grant to all employees under the 1991 and 1997 Plans that vests over two years and has a term of seven years. 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the "1996 Plan") Each non employee director of Teradyne is entitled to participate in the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options to purchase up to a maximum of 1,600,000 shares of common stock. The 1996 Plan provides for the automatic grant (i) of an option to purchase 22,500 shares of Teradyne common stock 33 to each non employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors on or after August 26, 1999, (ii) on February 5, 2001, of an option to purchase 6,750 shares of Teradyne common stock to each person who was a non employee director on February 7, 2000, (iii) on February 5, 2001, of an option to purchase 15,750 shares of Teradyne common stock to each non employee who became a new member of the Board during February 2000, and (iv) of an option to purchase 11,250 shares of Teradyne common stock to each person who is a non employee director on the first Monday in February in each year beginning on February 5, 2001 and continuing throughout the term of the Plan. No other options shall be granted under the terms of the 1996 Plan. Options granted under the 1996 Plan must be NQOs, shall be granted at 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to January 2002 expire five years following the date of grant and options granted thereafter expire seven years following the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to February 5, 2001 become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year and options granted on or after February 5, 2001 are immediately exercisable. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1996 Plan. Generally, if an optionee ceases to be a director of Teradyne other than by reason of death, no further installments of his or her options become exercisable and the options terminate after three months. However, under certain circumstances, unless a board member becomes a director of a competitor of Teradyne, if the board member goes into government service or retires from the Board of Directors, such option may be exercised within its original terms. The 1996 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2006. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2002, FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Teradyne has determined that the adoption of SFAS 146 will not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. In December of 2002, FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The amendments to SFAS 123 in SFAS 148 shall be effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The amendment to SFAS 123 and the amendment to Accounting Principles Board No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting," in SFAS 148 shall be effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Teradyne has determined that SFAS 148 will not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations and has adopted the disclosure requirements in this Form 10 K. In February 2003, FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21 ("EITF 00 21"), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables". EITF 00 21 requires revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting. If the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria, arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. Applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting. The guidance in EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Teradyne is currently in the process of reviewing EITF 00 21. In November 2002, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at 34 the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantors fiscal year end. The disclosure requirements in this Interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. Teradyne has determined that the adoption of FIN 45 will not have a material impact on its financial statements and results of operations and has adopted the disclosure requirements in this Form 10 K. In January 2003, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which addresses consolidation by a business of variable interest entities in which it is the primary beneficiary. The Interpretation is effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Teradyne does not expect that the adoption of FIN 46 to have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results From time to time, information provided by Teradyne, statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Form 10 K) contain statements that are not purely historical, but are forward looking statements, made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, forward looking statements made herein include projections, plans, and objectives for Teradynes business, financial condition, operating results, future operations, or future economic performance, statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements, capital expenditures, expectations as to customer orders and demand for Teradynes products and statements relating to backlog, bookings and cancellations, gross margins and pricing considerations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, which could cause Teradynes actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. These factors, and others, are discussed from time to time in Teradynes filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Teradynes Business Is Impacted by the Slowdown in Economies Worldwide. Teradynes business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the global economies that began in the second half of 2000. The uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies have caused companies to reduce capital investments and may cause further reduction of such investments. These reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which Teradyne serves and have contributed to Teradyne incurring losses. Teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound, whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow, or if or when Teradyne will return to profitability. The effects of the economic decline are being felt across all of Teradynes business segments and continue to result in significantly reduced customer orders. Current Geopolitical Turmoil and the Continuing Threat of Domestic and International Terrorist Attacks May Adversely Impact Teradynes Revenues. International turmoil, exacerbated by the war in Iraq and the escalating tensions in North Korea have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate, both in the United States and globally, which may affect Teradynes ability to generate revenue on a predictable basis. In addition, recent terrorist attacks internationally and the threat of future terrorist attacks both domestically and internationally have negatively impacted an already weakened worldwide economy. As Teradyne sells products both in the United States and internationally, the threat of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect Teradynes business. These conditions make it difficult for Teradyne, and it customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. 35 Teradynes Business is Dependent on the Current and Anticipated Market for Electronics. Teradynes business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. The current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of 2000 and the effects of the hostilities begun in September 2001. Historically, the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply, which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment, including systems manufactured and marketed by Teradyne. Teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that Teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations. Teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Teradyne cannot assure that the continued slump in new orders will turn around in the future or that any increase in sales or new orders for a calendar year will be sustained in subsequent years. In addition, any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and operating results. Teradyne Has Taken and Expects to Continue to Take Measures to Address the Current Slowdown in the Market for Its Products Which Could Have Long term Negative Effects on Teradynes Business. Teradyne has taken and expects to continue to take measures to address the current slowdown in the market for its products. In particular, Teradyne has reduced its workforce, closed facilities, reduced the pay of certain employees, implemented furloughs, discontinued certain of its product lines, implemented material cost reduction programs, reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense budgets. These measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders. However, each measure Teradyne has taken and any additional measures taken in the future to contain expenditures could have long term negative effects on Teradynes business by reducing its pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in its products, increasing Teradynes debt, and making it more difficult for Teradyne to respond to customers or competitors. Teradynes Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Acquisitions Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has acquired a number of businesses. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations. Such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks, including: . the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; . the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; . the inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business; . the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business; . the possibility that Teradynes reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business; . potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business, including but not limited to regulatory, environmental and tax liabilities; . the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles, which may adversely affect Teradynes reported results of operations; and . litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions. For example, in connection with the August 2000 acquisition of each of Herco Technology Corp., a California company, and Perception Laminates, Inc., a California company, a complaint was filed on or about September 5, 2001 and is now pending in Federal District Court, San Diego, California, by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants Teradyne and two of its executive officers. This case is further described in "Item 3: Legal Proceedings" in this Form 10 K. 36 Additionally, in 2001, Teradyne was designated as a "potentially responsible party" ("PRP") at a clean up site in Los Angeles, California. This claim arises out of Teradynes acquisition of Perception Laminates, Inc. in August 2000. Prior to that date, Perception Laminates had itself acquired certain assets of Alco Industries Inc. under an asset purchase agreement dated July 30, 1992. Neither Teradyne nor Perception Laminates have ever conducted any operations at the Los Angeles site. Teradyne has asked the State of California to drop the PRP designation, but California has not yet agreed to do so. This case is further described in "Item 1: Business" under "Environmental Affairs" in this Form 10 K. In addition to the foregoing, any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to Teradynes expectations. Teradyne Currently Faces, and in the Future May Be the Subject of, Securities Class Action Litigation Due to Past or Future Stock Price Volatility. Teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in Federal District Court, Boston, Massachusetts, in October and November 2001. The court consolidated the cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs. On November 8, 2002, plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by making, during the period from July 14, 2000 until October 17, 2000, material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding Teradynes business operations and future prospects. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Teradyne filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on February 7, 2003. Teradynes motion has not yet been heard. Claims asserted in this case are similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed in "Item 3: Legal Proceedings," which is pending in the Federal District Court in San Diego, California. Teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously. Management does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on Teradynes financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. Teradynes Business May be Adversely Impacted by Divestitures of Lines of Business Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has divested itself of certain lines of business. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional such divestitures. Such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks, including: . the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; . disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; . customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business; and . the decreased diversification of Teradynes product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make Teradynes operating results subject to increased market fluctuations. If Teradyne Is Unable to Protect Its Intellectual Property, Teradyne May Lose a Valuable Asset or May Incur Costly Litigation to Protect Its Rights. Teradynes products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets. While Teradyne believes that its patents, copyrights and trade secrets have value in general, no single one is in itself essential. At times, Teradyne has been notified that it may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against Teradyne, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products, or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results. 37 If Teradyne Fails to Develop New Technologies to Adapt to Its Customers Needs and if Its Customers Fail to Accept Its New Products, Teradynes Revenues Will Be Adversely Affected. Teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers. Teradynes development of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products, and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to Teradynes success. Successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors, including: . new product selection; . development of competitive products by competitors; . timely and efficient completion of product design; . timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing; and . assembly processes and product performance at customer locations. Teradyne Is Subject to Intense Competition. Teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments. Some of Teradynes competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers. Some of Teradynes competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those Teradyne currently offers. Teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of Teradynes products. Moreover, increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition, which could materially adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. Teradyne Is Subject to Risks of Operating Internationally. Teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the United States. Teradynes international sales are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including: . unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; . compliance with customs regulations; . changes in tariffs and exchange rates; . political and economic instability, acts of terrorism and international conflicts; . difficulties in accounts receivable collection; . difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and . potentially adverse tax consequences, such as the World Trade Organizations dispute against the U.S. Foreign Sales Credit. Teradynes Business May Suffer if it is Unable to Attract and Retain Key Employees. Competition for certain employees with skills required by Teradyne is intense in the high technology industry. Teradynes success will depend on its ability to attract and retain key technical employees in this business segment. The loss of one or more key or other employees, Teradynes inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations or financial condition. 38 If Teradynes Suppliers do not Meet Teradynes Product or Delivery Requirements, Teradyne Could Have Reduced Revenues and Earnings. The availability of certain components, including semiconductor chips, may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet Teradynes quality or delivery requirements. If any of Teradynes suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments with Teradyne or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for Teradynes products, Teradyne could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Teradyne relies upon third party contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in its products, and Teradynes ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom Teradyne does not exercise any control. Teradyne May Incur Significant Liabilities if It Fails to Comply With Environmental Regulations. Teradyne is subject to environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes. If Teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations, or is required to perform site remediation, Teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also: . restrict Teradynes ability to expand its facilities; . require Teradyne to acquire costly equipment; or . require Teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses. Teradyne Has Substantially Increased Its Indebtedness. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne completed a private placement of $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") due 2006 and received net proceeds of $389 million. On December 19, 2001, Teradyne obtained a loan of approximately $45 million in the form of a 7.5% mortgage loan maturing on January 1, 2007 (the "Mortgage"). As a result, Teradyne has incurred approximately $445 million principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization. The level of Teradynes indebtedness, among other things, could: . make it difficult for Teradyne to make payments on its debt and other obligations; . make it difficult for Teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; . require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service for indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; . limit Teradynes flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, its business and the industries in which Teradyne competes; . place Teradyne at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and . make Teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in its business. There can be no assurance that Teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Mortgage. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Satisfy Certain Obligations in the Event of a Change in Control. The indenture governing the Notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of Teradyne. If a change in control as defined in the indenture is triggered, Teradyne may be required to offer to purchase the Notes with cash. If Teradyne has to make that offer, Teradyne cannot be sure that it will have enough funds to pay for all the Notes that the holders could tender. 39 In the event of a change in control of Teradyne, the Mortgage lender may elect to declare all amounts due under the Mortgage to be immediately due and payable, and may elect to take possession of or sell the property subject to the Mortgage. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Pay Its Debt and Other Obligations. If Teradynes cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations, Teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems. If Teradyne sustains continued losses or is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes, the Mortgage, or certain of its other obligations, Teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness Teradyne may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, Teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the Notes or the Mortgage if payment of those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations. Moreover, Teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes or the Mortgage at their respective maturities. Teradyne May Need Additional Financing, Which Could Be Difficult to Obtain. Teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, the proceeds of the Notes offering in October 2001 and the proceeds from the Mortgage financing in December 2001, will be sufficient to meet Teradynes cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twenty four months. However, Teradyne has a finite amount of cash and in the event Teradyne may need to raise additional funds, due to on going losses or other reasons, Teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, particularly in light of Teradynes continued quarterly losses. Further, if Teradyne issues additional equity securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Future financings may place restrictions on how Teradyne operates its business. If Teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, Teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow its business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm Teradynes business. If Teradyne is Required to Account for Options Under Its Employee Stock Plans as a Compensation Expense, Teradynes Compensation Expense Would Be Increased. There has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options. Teradyne currently discloses pro forma compensation expense quarterly by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net (loss) earnings and net (loss) earnings per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements. It is possible that future laws and regulations will require Teradyne to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations. Note B, "Accounting Policies," of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on Teradynes net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three years. Also included in Item 7: "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," Teradyne has included stock based compensation disclosures that exceed current disclosure requirements. Provisions of Teradynes Charter and By Laws and Massachusetts Law Make a Takeover of Teradyne More Difficult. Teradynes basic corporate documents, its stockholder rights plan, and Massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of Teradyne, even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of Teradynes stockholders. 40 Teradynes Operating Results Are Likely to Fluctuate Significantly. Teradynes quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability, including: . competitive pressures on selling prices; . the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of orders previously received; . provisions for excess and obsolete inventory; . charges for certain long lived assets, including goodwill; . changes in product mix; . Teradynes ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis; . the introduction of products and technologies by Teradynes competitors; . market acceptance of Teradynes and its competitors products; . fulfilling backlog on a timely basis; . reliance on sole source suppliers; . potential retrofit costs; . the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter; and . the timing of investments in engineering and development. In particular, due to Teradynes introduction of a number of new, complex test systems in 2001 and 2002, there can be no assurance that Teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, Teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts, and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in European and Japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position. Forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy U.S. dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was $11.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively. A 10% fluctuation in exchange rates for 2002 and 2001 currencies would change the fair value by approximately $1.2 million and $1.3 million, 41 respectively. However, since these contracts hedge non U.S. currency assets and liabilities, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged. The hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at December 31, 2002 and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk Management Teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. Debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Since the convertible debt was "out of the money" at year end, it was treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential decrease in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On this basis, the potential loss in fair value from changes in interest rates is $6.9 million and $7.1 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The potential loss reflects a fair value loss on debt offset by a fair value gain on investments. Teradyne expects to hold its debt to maturity or conversion, whichever is sooner. Therefore, the realization of the potential loss on the debt obligations is unlikely. 42 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include some amounts based on managements best judgments and estimates. Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly. The internal control system is augmented by appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business ethics applicable to all employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries. Management believes that Teradynes internal controls provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and other data and maintaining accountability for assets. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are not employees or officers of Teradyne, meets periodically with the independent accountants, internal auditors and management to discuss internal controls, auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent accountants the scope and results of the audit. The Audit Committee also meets with the independent accountants without management present to ensure that the independent accountants have free access to the Audit Committee. The independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are engaged to audit the consolidated financial statements of Teradyne and to conduct such tests and related procedures as they deem necessary in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. The opinion of the independent accountants, based upon their audits of the consolidated financial statements, is contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. /S/ GEORGE W. CHAMILLARD George W.
