In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101). SAB 101 summarizes certain of the Staffs views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Teradyne implemented the SECs SAB 101 guidelines, retroactive to the beginning of the year. This was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2000. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years resulted in a charge to income of $64.1 million (net of income taxes of $27.5 million) or $0.35 per diluted share which has been included in income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. For the fiscal year ended 17 December 31, 2000, Teradyne recognized $126.1 million in revenue that is included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000. Pro forma amounts for the periods beginning before January 1, 2000 have not been presented as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not be reasonably determined. Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of Teradynes plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Teradynes actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, managment evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to Teradynes customers upon shipment. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, Teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur. For equipment where there is hardware and software that is incidental to the product, revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require Teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, Teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered 18 item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of Teradyne. Teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Teradynes post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. Teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and Teradyne defers revenue in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 90 1. Teradynes products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. Teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. Connection Systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements. Teradyne generally does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position No. 97 2 SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Revenue is deferred in instances when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements is not determinable. Vendor specific evidence of fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. 19 Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans Teradyne accounts for its employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Teradynes employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan. Teradynes stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. There have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of the employee stock purchase plan under Teradynes stock plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid in capital. Teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. See Note B: Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at December 31, 2003. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence, including profitability, exists that realization is more likely than not. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets Teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors Teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of Teradynes use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When Teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, Teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. Teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The volatility of the industries that Teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows, which can impact their ability to make required payments. Teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customers current payment history, the customers current financial statements and other information regarding the customers credit worthiness. If the financial condition of Teradynes customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 20 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Percentage of net revenue: Net Revenue: Products 82.5 % 81.2 % 85.6 % Service 17.5 18.8 14.4 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Expenses: Cost of products 59.0 67.9 70.5 Cost of service 11.5 13.1 10.1 Total cost of revenue 70.5 81.0 80.6 Engineering and development 18.8 24.0 20.0 Selling and administrative 18.4 23.8 18.7 Restructuring and other charges 5.3 10.3 5.2 Goodwill impairment 6.4 Gain on the sale of a business (1.0 ) 113.0 145.5 123.5 Net interest and other (expense) income (0.7 ) (0.4 ) 0.9 Loss before income taxes (13.7 ) (45.9 ) (22.6 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 0.6 12.9 (8.6 ) Net loss (14.3 )% (58.8 )% (14.0 )% Results of Operations: Business Overview Teradynes operating results were adversely affected by the recent severe technology and semiconductor downturn which affected the semiconductor industry and caused a general reduction in capital spending. As a result of the challenging economic conditions, Teradyne has taken significant cost structure initiatives to more appropriately size the business. Actions taken include: reductions in workforce across all groups which has led to the consolidation and reorganization of certain functions, curtailment of discretionary expenses, shifts of manufacturing and some shared services operations to lower cost regions, reductions in the number of operating facilities and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing and applications development. In addition, Teradyne has eliminated certain product lines to efficiently allocate engineering and development spending to areas that provide a high potential for growth. Recent increases in business activity indicate that the industry is in the midst of a recovery leading to the next growth cycle. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Teradynes net bookings increased 45% sequentially, and worldwide semiconductor test utilization levels climbed to levels which had not been seen since the past business peak in 2000. Although sales remained relatively flat throughout the four quarters of 2003, net bookings increased almost 40% from the first to the second half of the year. 21 Bookings Teradynes net orders for its four principal operating segments for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PercentChange 2001 2002PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 837.9 $ 480.5 $ 294.0 74 % 63 % Connection Systems 317.7 149.8 385.0 112 (61 ) Assembly Test Systems 156.6 167.8 101.4 (7 ) 65 Other Test Systems 105.9 107.2 27.8 (1 ) 286 $ 1,418.1 $ 905.3 $ 808.2 57 % 12 % From 2002 to 2003, the growth in orders shifted more heavily to Subcons in Taiwan, Singapore and other parts of Asia. During the last quarter of 2003, Teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs for the wireless and baseband industries, whose chips are sold mainly by European and U.S. semiconductor companies. These chips are fabricated and tested by Foundries and Subcons in many parts of Asia, but concentrated in Taiwan and Singapore and increasingly in China. The economic downturn which prevailed in the past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs. As a result, an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource their non core competency testing needs to Subcons in low cost regions. As Teradynes total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings have grown, the bookings from Subcons have continued to make up a larger percentage of total orders. Bookings from Subcons increased 325% from $72 million in 2002 to $307 million in 2003 and made up 37% of total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings in 2003 compared to 15% of total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings in 2002. In 2001, excess inventory, slower economic growth and a reduction in end user demand of electronic goods by Teradynes Semiconductor Test Systems customers resulted in a reduction in capital spending as well as cancellations or postponements of previously placed orders. From 2001 to 2002, Semiconductor Test Systems bookings grew primarily as a result of increased demand for SOC products by both IDMs and Subcons. The increase in Connection Systems bookings from 2002 to 2003 was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in 2003, as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market, driven by wireless network deployments, which increased appreciably for both U.S. and European telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003. Teradynes high speed high density interconnect and backplane solutions, such as VHDM HSD, are well positioned in this market. Bookings were up modestly in the computer/server market, and down in the storage market as Connection Systems exited a lower margin EMS product line and repositioned itself to support its core products. From 2001 to 2002, bookings were impacted by significant cancellations along with a decline in demand of over 50% from key communications customers year over year. The net decrease in Assembly Test Systems orders from 2002 to 2003 is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines. This decrease was offset by a 25% increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the Mil/Aero business, which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of 2003. The increase in orders from 2001 to 2002 largely resulted from the full year impact of the GenRad acquisition. The first half of 2001 had strong orders from contract manufacturers in the in circuit test business but demand weakened as a result of the sluggish economy in the latter half of 2001 and into 2002. The increase in Other Test Systems bookings from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the addition of Diagnostic Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the acquisition of GenRad, which includes Diagnostic Systems, which is included in the Other Test Systems segment. 22 Teradynes cancellations for its four principal operating segments for the last three years are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 6.9 $ 52.5 $ 80.2 Connection Systems 16.0 104.3 193.0 Assembly Test Systems 2.5 2.2 2.5 Other Test Systems 9.8 $ 25.4 $ 159.0 $ 285.5 The Semiconductor Test Systems cancellations were largely due to orders that were booked in late 2000 and early 2001 by Subcons in anticipation of a further increase in their own demand. Cancellations in the Connection Systems business came from major customers in the telecommunication and information technology infrastructure industries, as their own demand levels dropped. Teradynes net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 United States 35 % 44 % 55 % Europe 17 18 24 South East Asia 18 13 10 Singapore 11 8 3 Taiwan 10 6 3 Japan 8 9 3 Rest of the World 1 2 2 100 % 100 % 100 % For the past three years, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 333.7 $ 240.0 $ 317.2 Connection Systems 75.6 104.2 357.6 Assembly Test Systems 56.1 53.4 55.5 Other Test Systems 40.7 43.3 32.7 $ 506.1 $ 440.9 $ 763.0 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2003, 2002, and 2001 there were no significant cancellation penalties received. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, Teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, financial condition, and results of operations. Revenue Teradynes net revenue for its four principal operating segments for 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PercentChange 2001 2002PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 735.4 $ 557.5 $ 717.7 32 % (22 )% Connection Systems 357.2 397.0 540.8 (10 ) (27 ) Assembly Test Systems 151.6 170.8 132.4 (11 ) 29 Other Test Systems 108.7 96.9 49.7 12 95 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 $ 1,440.6 11 % (15 )% 23 More than half of the Semiconductor Test Systems sales increase from 2002 to 2003 is attributable to growing sales to Subcons for use in their Asian facilities, primarily Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. The revenue derived from Subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal SOC customers, led by sales of Catalyst and Tiger systems. As is described in the Bookings section, Semiconductor Test Systems has seen a recent growth in revenue due to increased need for testing in the wireless and baseband sectors. To a lesser extent, the Semiconductor Test Systems segment continues to see revenue growth in the optical disk sector, automotive applications testing, and image sensor testing. Included in 2001 Semiconductor Test Systems sales is $98.7 million from the accounting impact of the implementation of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements in the fourth quarter of 2000 due to shipments of customer orders in 2000 where title was retained by Teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security interest. Connection Systems sales declined from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin EMS business. The segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years. The increase in Assembly Test Systems revenue from 2001 to 2002 largely resulted from the full year impact of the GenRad acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2001. From the second half of 2001 through 2003, the commercial business saw decreases in revenue, particularly in the in circuit test business, while the Mil/Aero business has seen steady revenue numbers throughout the past three years. The increase in Other Test Systems revenue from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the addition of Diagnostic Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the acquisition of GenRad, which includes Diagnostic Solutions, which is included in the Other Test Systems segment. Teradynes four principal operating segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years: 2003 2002 2001 Semiconductor Test Systems 55 % 46 % 50 % Connection Systems 26 32 38 Assembly Test Systems 11 14 9 Other Test Systems 8 8 3 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 United States 37 % 46 % 51 % Europe 17 18 19 South East Asia 17 11 9 Singapore 11 8 4 Taiwan 9 9 10 Japan 8 6 4 Rest of the World 1 2 3 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PercentChange 2001 2002PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Product Revenue $ 1,115.9 $ 992.1 $ 1,233.7 12 % (20 )% Service Revenue 237.0 230.1 206.9 3 11 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 $ 1,440.6 11 % (15 )% 24 Service revenue is derived from the servicing of Teradynes installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2003, 2002, and 2001, Teradynes three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21%, 23% and 24% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Gross Margin 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PointChange 2001 2002PointChange (dollars in millions) Gross Margin $ 398.9 $ 232.7 $ 278.8 Percent of Total Revenue 29.5 % 19.0 % 19.4 % 10.5 (0.4 ) Teradynes gross margin improvement from 2002 to 2003 was impacted by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, lower inventory provisions, and volume and product mix. Gross margin improvement of 4.9 points is attributed to reduced fixed manufacturing costs, including depreciation and facility costs resulting from restructuring actions primarily taken in the second half of 2002, along with increased sales volumes which resulted in higher utilization. An improvement of 2.5 points of gross margin is credited to a shift in Teradynes mix of revenues, with a higher percentage in 2003 being derived from Semiconductor Test Systems which has higher incremental margins, coupled with a shift in Teradynes supply chain to low cost regions. Inventory provisions decreased from $39.0 million in 2002 to $16.6 million in 2003, which contributed a 2.0 point gross margin improvement. Teradynes gross margin remained relatively flat from 2001 to 2002, and was impacted by a variety of factors including lower inventory provisions, offset by pricing pressures and lower utilization of fixed manufacturing costs as sales volumes decreased. Inventory provisions decreased from $139.7 million in 2001 to $39.0 million in 2002, which contributed a 6.5 point gross margin improvement. As sales volumes decreased from 2001 to 2002 and certain components of cost of revenues remained fixed, gross margin was negatively impacted by 1.8 points due to the lower utilization of manufacturing overhead. Pricing pressures, net of product mix and cost reduction activities in the second half of 2002 resulted in a 1.6 point decrease in gross margin. The breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PointChange 2001 2002PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Margin $ 317.1 $ 163.0 $ 217.5 Percent of Product Revenue 28.4 % 16.4 % 17.6 % 12.0 (1.2 ) 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PointChange 2001 2002PointChange (dollars in millions) Service Gross Margin $ 81.8 $ 69.7 $ 61.4 Percent of Service Revenue 34.5 % 30.3 % 29.7 % 4.2 0.6 Teradyne assesses the carrying value of its inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are 25 not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. The activity with respect to the provisions recorded for excess and obsolete inventory for 2003, 2002, and 2001 is as follows: (in thousands) Inventory provisions for 2003 $ 16,569 Inventory scrapped Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 16,569 Inventory provisions for 2002 $ 39,021 Inventory scrapped (7,005 ) Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2002 32,016 Inventory scrapped (7,838 ) Inventory sold (3,989 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 20,189 Inventory provisions for 2001 $ 139,683 Inventory scrapped (33,897 ) Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2001 105,786 Inventory scrapped (15,782 ) Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2002 90,004 Inventory scrapped (22,488 ) Inventory sold (1,295 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 66,221 Teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory. The yearly provisions consisted of obsolete and excess inventory as follows: ExcessInventory ObsoleteInventory TotalProvision (in millions) 2003 Provision $ 7.4 $ 9.2 $ 16.6 2002 Provision 28.1 10.9 39.0 2001 Provision 44.4 95.3 139.7 Teradynes writedowns and write offs consisted of raw material and components. The provisions were accounted for in the following segments: 2003 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 5.2 31 % $ 27.9 71 % $ 118.6 85 % Connection Systems 1.6 10 % 3.8 10 % 15.5 11 % Assembly Test Systems 9.3 56 % 7.0 18 % 5.6 4 % Other Test Systems 0.5 3 % 0.3 1 % 0 % Total $ 16.6 100 % $ 39.0 100 % $ 139.7 100 % 26 Of the inventory provision recorded in 2003, $9.3 million relates to Assembly Test Systems which includes $3.6 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing, distributing and primary support of the AOI product line and $5.2 million relates to Semiconductor Test Systems SOC parts and components. Of the inventory provision recorded in 2002 for Semiconductor Test Systems, $20.7 million was in memory test related to Probe One and J996 product line discontinuances. The Probe One and J996 inventory has been fully written off as of December 31, 2003. There is no material exposure remaining for the Probe One or J996 products. The total 2001 inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was $139.7 million and was principally due to the sharp decline in incoming Semiconductor Test Systems and Connection Systems orders. Of the 2001 provision for Semiconductor Test Systems, $86.3 million was related to SOC parts and $32.3 million was for memory product parts and components related to an inventory writedown for the discontinuance of Teradynes Flash 750 memory product. Teradyne currently does not believe there is any material remaining exposure for the other products that Teradyne continues to actively market, although our estimates of future demand may differ from actual demand which may result in additional provisions. As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, Teradyne had inventory related reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of $191.1 million and $220.8 million, respectively. Engineering and Development 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003Change 2001 2002Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 254.6 $ 293.9 $ 287.3 $ (39.3 ) $ 6.6 Percent of Total Revenue 18.8 % 24.0 % 20.0 % Throughout the downturn, Teradyne has maintained its commitment to sustained levels of investment in research through continued engineering and development spending. More than two thirds of Teradynes total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between $150 $250 million. During the past three years, Semiconductor Test Systems has reduced the number of platforms under major development, which has increased the resources for remaining platforms. The consolidation of multiple product divisions within Semiconductor Test Systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation. Semiconductor Test Systems has consolidated engineering facilities, outsourced certain software engineering development to a low cost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce overall costs. The reduction in engineering and development expenses from 2002 to 2003 resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within Semiconductor Test Systems and Assembly Test Systems. The elimination of memory test within the Semiconductor Test Systems segment resulted in a reduction of $13 million and $5 million in engineering expenses from 2001 to 2002 and 2002 to 2003, respectively. As a result of the sale in Assembly Test Systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products, engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003 decreased by approximately $15 million. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts: $16 million as a result of a workforce reduction, partially offset by a $10 million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases in the third quarter of 2002; 27 $13 million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering as a result of the decision to use internal resources; $4 million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the recent writedown of assets, as well as the trend to rent or lease, rather than purchase, development tools; and $3 million from reduced office and facility costs as a result of recent cost saving actions. The increase in spending from 2001 to 2002 in engineering and development was primarily due to: $23 million as a result of the additional expense base resulting from Teradynes purchase of GenRad in the fourth quarter of 2001; and $6 million from the granting of the prior years previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of 2002. The additional engineering and development expense in 2001 compared to 2002 was partially offset by actions taken to reduce costs which consist of the following: $16 million as a result of a workforce reduction; $7 million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering as a result of the decision to use internal resources; $5 million for a reduction in prototype engineering materials; and $2 million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the writedown of assets.

The increase in spending from 2001 to 2002 in selling and administrative was principally due to the additional expense base resulting from Teradynes purchase of GenRad in the fourth quarter of 2001 with an additional increase coming from the granting of the prior years previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of 2002. The additional selling and administrative expense was partially offset by workforce reductions and other actions taken to reduce costs which consisted of the following: $7 million from a reduction in promotional spending and travel cutbacks. $5 million from a reduction in consulting spending; and 28 Restructuring and Other Charges The table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended December 31, 2003 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment SeveranceandBenefits Loss onSale ofProductLines FacilityRelated OtherCharges Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 8,242 $ $ 25,240 $ $ 33,482 2003 provision 29,403 21,367 6,891 12,350 1,273 71,284 Cash payments (21,843 ) (8,368 ) (30,211 ) Asset writedowns (29,403 ) (6,891 ) (36,294 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ $ 7,766 $ $ 29,222 $ 1,273 $ 38,261 The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. Teradyne expects to pay out $7 million against the lease accrual over the next twelve months. Teradynes future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $13 million as of December 31, 2003. Teradyne has subleased approximately 16% of its unoccupied space as of December 31, 2003 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space. Prior to January 1, 2003, Teradyne recorded restructuring charges for its unoccupied facilities leased under operating leases at the time Teradyne committed to the plan to permanently vacate the facilities. The restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment after the facilities were to be vacated net of Teradynes estimated probable sublease income. For actions initiated after January 1, 2003, the restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment net of Teradynes estimated probable sublease income once Teradyne ceased using the facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded charges of $29.4 million primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets. The charges include the following: $11.2 million for the reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale; $11.2 million related primarily to the sale and leaseback of manufacturing assets; and $7.0 million related primarily to manufacturing assets and equipment. The charge for reduction in the fair value of the properties held for sale resulted from a deterioration in real estate market conditions. The carrying value of Teradynes assets, primarily manufacturing equipment, held for sale was $0.2 million as of December 31, 2003. The carrying value of Teradynes assets held for sale was $45.3 million as of December 31, 2002. These assets were included in Property, Plant and Equipment. As of December 31, 2003, all of the properties held for sale had been sold. Teradyne owns approximately 226,000 square feet of unoccupied space as of December 31, 2003 at its North Reading, MA facility that Teradyne expects to utilize for future expansion. Teradyne has not recorded any impairment charges for this temporarily idle facility. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during the year ended December 31, 2003 of $21.4 million. There were approximately 890 employees terminated in the year ended December 31, 2003 across all functional groups at Teradyne. All remaining severance benefits payable to these employees are expected to be paid by the end of the fourth quarter of 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded a charge of $8.1 million for the loss on sale of product lines, of which $6.9 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges and $1.2 million has been recorded in cost of revenues. In the first quarter of 2003, the Assembly Test Systems segment sold its 29 manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line for total cash proceeds of $2.1 million. These transactions resulted in a loss of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Teradyne decided to sell the manufacturing software product line and the manual x ray inspection and rework product line because the product lines were not able to generate sufficient levels of revenue and earnings growth. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Other Test Systems segment recorded a charge of $1.4 million to writedown its net assets relating to the sale of the Autodiagnos automotive after market product. Autodiagnos was a part of the Diagnostic Solutions segment, which is a supplier of automotive manufacturing and service bay test and diagnostic systems. The Autodiagnos product line was selling to the independent repair market. With changes in legislation and consolidations in the automotive industry it became evident that this may have resulted in Autodiagnos being in direct competition with some of Diagnostic Solutions major customers. Strategically, Teradyne decided to sell Autodiagnos to negate this conflict and concentrate on its core business. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded a charge of $12.4 million consisting primarily of revised estimates of the amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded a charge of $1.3 million primarily for contractual penalties associated with resizing the Connection Systems business. The accrual for contractual penalties is reflected in other accrued liabilities. The restructuring actions taken during 2003 are expected to generate cost savings of approximately $86.3 million annually across all areas of operations. The table below summarizes activity for the year ended December 31, 2002 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment FacilityRelated Severance and Benefits Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ $ 1,676 8,471 $ 10,147 2002 provision 76,994 25,751 22,495 125,240 Cash payments (2,187 ) (22,724 ) (24,911 ) Asset writedowns (76,994 ) (76,994 ) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 25,240 $ 8,242 $ 33,482 During 2002, Teradyne recorded charges of $77.0 million primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets. The charges included machinery and equipment, facilities held for sale and intangible assets (see Note L: Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). All of the machinery and equipment and facilities have been sold or disposed of as of December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a charge of $25.8 million relating to future lease commitments for vacated manufacturing and administrative space which have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. The lease accruals are expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during 2002 of $22.5 million. There were approximately 1,010 employees terminated across all functional groups during 2002. All remaining severance benefits payable to these employees are expected to be paid by the end of the first quarter of 2004. 30 The table below summarizes activity for the year ended December 31, 2001, relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment FacilityRelated Severance and Benefits Total (in thousands) 2001 provision $ 35,338 $ 1,676 $ 37,278 $ 74,292 Cash payments (28,807 ) (28,807 ) Asset writedowns (35,338 ) (35,338 ) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ $ 1,676 $ 8,471 $ 10,147 During the year ended December 31, 2001, Teradyne recorded a charge of $35.3 million for impaired long lived assets, consisting of a held for sale facility, manufacturing assets and equipment manufactured by Teradyne used in manufacturing and engineering and development relating to the discontinuance of a product line. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Teradyne recorded charges for vacated office space under operating leases of $1.7 million. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and long term other accrued liabilities. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during 2001 of $37.3 million. There were approximately 2,900 employees terminated across all functional groups. As of December 31, 2002, Teradyne had paid all severance benefits relating to the 2001 terminations. For further details on Teradynes restructuring and other charges during 2003, 2002 and 2001 see Note L: Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Impairment Unless conditions dictate otherwise, Teradynes annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Teradyne tested both reporting units, Assembly Test Systems and Connection Systems, for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the quarter ended September 28, 2003, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for the fiscal years 2004 through 2006 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 112 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 28, 2003. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. During the quarter ended September 29, 2002, as a result of contraction in the Assembly Test Systems market to its lowest level in a decade as evidenced by various market reports available to Teradyne, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 94 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 29, 2002. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment exceeded its fair value and recognized a $78.5 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment to its carrying value. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. 31 Gain on the Sale of a Business On June 22, 2001, Teradyne sold its aerospace and defense connector and backplane business to Amphenol Corporation of Wallingford, Connecticut for cash proceeds of $26.3 million. This transaction resulted in a gain of $14.8 million. Interest Income and Expense 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003Change 2001 2002Change (in millions) Interest income $ 14.0 $ 17.0 $ 22.7 $ (3.0 ) $ (5.7 ) Interest expense $ (20.9 ) $ (21.8 ) $ (4.1 ) $ 0.9 $ (17.7 ) The decrease in interest income from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to lower interest rates. The decrease in interest expense from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of Teradynes California mortgage in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in interest expense from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to interest expense related to convertible notes which Teradyne issued in the fourth quarter of 2001. Other Income and Expense, Net Other income and expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 includes the following: Income/(expense) 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Mortgage prepayment penalty (1) $ (3,220 ) Other than temporary impairment of investment (2,592 ) Gain on sale of investment 2,800 Repayment of loan by divested entity (2) $ 7,144 Other than temporary impairment of common stock investment (3,115 ) Writedown of investment in an engineering service provider (2,288 ) $ (1,800 ) Fair value adjustment on warrants 138 (2,051 ) 2,035 Equity investment (3) (6,974 ) Total $ (2,874 ) $ (310 ) $ (6,739 ) (1) Penalties related to prepayment of a $45 million mortgage loan collateralized against certain California real estate properties, which was to mature on January 1, 2007. (2) The loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection. (3) Teradynes proportionate share of a loss related to an equity investment in Empirix, Inc. The carrying value of this equity investment was zero at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased primarily due to increased revenues from 2002 to 2003. The increase in the loss before income taxes from 2001 to 2002 in Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems and Assembly Test Systems was due to decreased sales in Semiconductor Test Systems and Connection Systems, and goodwill and intangible asset impairments in Assembly Test Systems and the declining market conditions. Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased due to the addition of Diagnostic Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the GenRad acquisition. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2003, tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes. Teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003. Until sufficient positive evidence exists, including an appropriate level of profitability, Teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision of $157.5 million resulting in a tax rate of 28%. The tax rate of 28% is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. The evidence that Teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2002 included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year 2002 compared to earlier Teradyne forecasts, the inability to get to break even during 2002 despite implementing several restructuring programs, and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year 2003. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized. The effective tax rate benefit for the year ended 2001 was 38%. Teradynes effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily reflects the U.S. statutory income tax rate, the net effect of state taxes and the effect of tax benefits from its Ireland manufacturing operations. Tax exemptions relating to Ireland operations are effective through 2010.

Pension funding requirements are not known beyond 2004. 33 Liquidity and Capital Resources Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $44.9 million in 2003 from 2002, to $586.0 million. Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $45.1 million in 2002 from 2001, to $541.1 million and increased $121.8 million in 2001 from 2000, to $586.2 million. Cash activity for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003Change 2001 2002Change Cash provided by (used for) operating activities: Cash provided by (used for) net loss, adjusted for non cash items: $ 15.3 $ (207.4 ) $ 57.8 $ 222.7 $ (265.2 ) Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired 18.9 203.1 (136.8 ) (184.2 ) 339.9 Total cash provided by (used for) operating activities 34.2 (4.3 ) (79.0 ) 38.5 74.7 Cash used for investing activities (114.4 ) (102.2 ) (247.3 ) (12.2 ) 145.1 Cash provided by financing activities 57.1 40.4 401.5 16.7 (361.1 ) Total $ (23.1 ) $ (66.1 ) $ 75.2 $ 43.0 $ (141.3 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired provided cash of $18.9 million in 2003 as inventory balances decreased $56.3 million across each of Teradynes segments, although primarily in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, and accounts payable, deferred revenue and accruals increased by $24.0 million due to the increase in business in the fourth quarter of 2003, which is partially offset by a contribution to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan of approximately $10 million. The inventory and accounts payable, deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by an increase of $58.3 million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding, based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues, from 47.8 days in 2002 to 58.6 days in 2003. Teradyne plans to contribute $25 million to its U.S. Qualified Pension Plan in 2004. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $203.1 million in 2002 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of $93.7 million across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund of $85.2 million in March of 2002. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $136.8 million in 2001 as accounts payable, deferred revenue and accruals balances decreased as purchases slowed but were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory due to market conditions. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, proceeds for asset disposals, proceeds from the sale of product lines, cash acquired in business acquisitions, cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures increased by $4.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002. All operating segments increased capital expenditures, except the Connection Systems segment which decreased capital expenditures by $9.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in capital expenditures in the other segments was driven by an increase in equipment manufactured by Teradyne. Capital expenditures were $81.2 million in 2003, $76.4 million in 2002, and $241.4 million in 2001. Financing activities include the issuance of convertible notes, mortgage borrowings, sales of Teradynes common stock, as well as repayments of debt. During 2003, repayments of long term debt used cash of $43.4 million as Teradyne prepaid its mortgage on its California properties in the third quarter of 2003. In 2001, Teradyne assumed debt of $89.7 million from the GenRad acquisition which Teradyne repaid on October 26, 2001. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $100.5 million, $41.2 million, and $58.5 million, respectively. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne issued $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 (the Notes) in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 34 $26.00 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Teradyne began making annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Teradyne that rank equally with Teradynes existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In the event of a change in control by which Teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, the holders of the Notes may be able to require Teradyne to redeem some or all of the Notes either in discounted Teradyne common stock or in cash. On February 8, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a Registration Statement on Form S 3 covering both the Notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted. On or after October 18, 2004, Teradyne may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below. The redemption price, expressed as a percentage of principal amount, is as follows for the designated periods: Period Redemption Price Beginning on October 18, 2004 and ending on October 14, 2005 101.50 % Beginning on October 15, 2005 and ending on October 14, 2006 100.75 % and thereafter equal to 100% of the principal amount. Presently, it is managements intent to convert a portion of the Notes into equity at or around October 18, 2004, if Teradynes stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, to avoid the continuation of the annual interest payment of $15 million. However, there can be no assurance that even if Teradynes stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the Notes will convert into equity as Teradynes stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date. If this were to occur, Teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the Notes called into cash. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including Teradynes stock price, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities and Teradynes anticipated future liquidity needs. On December 19, 2001, Teradyne obtained a loan of approximately $45 million in the form of a 7.5% mortgage loan on its California properties maturing on January 1, 2007 (the Mortgage). Teradyne prepaid the Mortgage in the third quarter of 2003. Prior to the prepayment, principal payments were made according to a twenty year amortization schedule through December 2006, with the remaining principal due on January 1, 2007. On October 26, 2001, Teradyne completed its acquisition of GenRad, Inc. of Westford, MA, a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment, related software, and diagnostic solutions. GenRads business has been made part of the Assembly Test Systems operating segment excluding the Diagnostic Solutions business. Diagnostic Solutions has been made part of the Other Test Systems operating segment. Under the terms of the acquisition, each outstanding share of GenRad common stock was converted into 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock. The total number of Teradyne shares exchanged for the shares of GenRad, based on the shares of GenRad outstanding as of the closing, was approximately 5.0 million. Teradyne believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $586.0 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $25 million in 2004 to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan which is currently under funded. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans Teradynes pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit plan, was approximately $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was 0.93% of Teradynes total operating expenses. The largest portion of Teradynes 2003 pension expense was $8.2 million for its U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, which is calculated 35 based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected return on plan assets for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets of 8%. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, Teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Teradyne also considered its historical 15 year compounded return of 8% for the period ending December 31, 2002, which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Based on these historical returns, Teradyne believes that 8% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2003. The current asset allocation for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 47% invested in equity securities and 53% invested in fixed income securities. Teradynes actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2003 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model. Teradynes investment manager regularly reviews Teradynes actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances Teradynes investments to Teradynes targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust these returns as necessary. Teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2003 in the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan Teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately $17.0 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that Teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index, which was at 6.00% at December 31, 2003, down from 6.05% at December 31, 2002. As a result, Teradyne selected 6% for its December 31, 2003 discount rate, which was the same as from December 31, 2002. Each year Teradyne considers the Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index, along with other indices including the Moodys AA rated corporate bond yield and the Salomon Brothers 10+ Year AAA/AA rate. Teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan will be approximately $6.3 million, $6.6 million and $6.5 million in fiscal 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The pension expense estimates are based on a 6% discount rate. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in Teradynes pension plans. Teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2003, if Teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 5% 6% 7% (in millions) 7% $ 12.7 $ 9.6 $ 6.9 8% 11.4 8.2 5.6 9% 10.1 6.9 4.3 Teradynes funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $98.2 million at December 31, 2002 to $121.6 million at December 31, 2003. The investment performance returns and Teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $93.4 million at December 31, 2002 to $70.9 million at December 31, 2003. During 2003, Teradyne contributed $10 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $25 million in 2004 to this plan in order to meet the ERISA minimum funding requirements. 36 Employee Stock Options Teradynes equity compensation program is a broad based, long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Teradyne considers its equity compensation program critical to Teradynes operation and productivity. Approximately 83% of Teradynes employees participate in its equity compensation program. Of the stock options Teradyne granted in 2003, 88% went to employees other than the Chief Executive Officer and the five other most highly compensated executive officers.

Equity Compensation Plans In addition to Teradynes 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note P: Stock Based Compensation, Teradyne maintains three equity compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance to Teradynes employees, directors and or consultants: 1) 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan; 2) 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan; and 3) 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan. 38 The purpose of these plans is to promote the interests of Teradyne by attracting and retaining the services of qualified and talented persons to serve as employees, directors and or consultants of Teradyne. Except for the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of the foregoing plans was approved by Teradynes shareholders. The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2003: (1) (2) (3) Plan category Number of securities to be issued uponexercise ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Weighted average exercise price ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Number of securities remaining available for future issuanceunder stock option compensationplans (excluding securitiesreflected in column(1)) (shares in thousands) Stock option plans approved by shareholders 5,411 $ 23.59 2,891 Stock option plans not approved by shareholders(1) 24,157 22.28 18,510 Total 29,568 $ 22.52 21,401 (1) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), Teradyne assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of Teradyne common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock for each share of GenRad common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2003, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 355 shares of Teradyne common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $72.32 per share. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan) Under the 1991 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options which qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (ISOs) and non qualified stock options (NQOs), up to a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. ISOs may be granted only to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries and NQOs may be granted to employees, consultants and directors who are also employees of Teradyne. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 200,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted options to purchase, in the aggregate, more than 300,000 shares of common stock under the 1991 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1991 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an option whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the option, its exercise price and other pertinent terms, including vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each option may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees option may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1991 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2011. The 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) Under the 1997 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue ISOs to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries, and NQOs, stock awards and authorizations to purchase Teradyne common stock to employees, consultants or directors (provided that no options may be granted to non employee directors) up to a maximum of 53,000,000 39 shares. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 400,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted an option to acquire more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1997 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an award, the pertinent terms of such award, including, if such award is an option, whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the award, its exercise price and vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each award may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees award may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1997 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2007. Options granted prior to September 2001 under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of five years. Beginning in September 2001, options granted under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of seven years. In addition, Teradyne made a one time grant to all employees under the 1991 and 1997 Plans that vests over two years and has a term of seven years. 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 1996 Plan) Each non employee director of Teradyne is entitled to participate in the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options to purchase up to a maximum of 1,600,000 shares of common stock. The 1996 Plan provides for the automatic grant (i) of an option to purchase 25,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each non employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors on or after August 26, 1999, (ii) on February 5, 2001, of an option to purchase 6,750 shares of Teradyne common stock to each person who was a non employee director on February 7, 2000, (iii) on February 5, 2001, of an option to purchase 15,750 shares of Teradyne common stock to each non employee who became a new member of the Board during February 2000, and (iv) of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each person who is a non employee director on the first Monday in February in each year beginning on February 5, 2001 and continuing throughout the term of the Plan. The 1996 Plan was amended in 2003 to increase the automatic grants to (a) new non employee directors from 22,500 to 25,000 shares and (b) existing non employee directors from 11,250 to 15,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. No other options shall be granted under the terms of the 1996 Plan. Options granted under the 1996 Plan must be NQOs, shall be granted at 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to January 2002 expire five years following the date of grant and options granted thereafter expire seven years following the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to February 5, 2001 become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year and options granted on or after February 5, 2001 are immediately exercisable. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1996 Plan. Generally, if an optionee ceases to be a director of Teradyne other than by reason of death, no further installments of his or her options become exercisable and the options terminate after three months. However, under certain circumstances, unless a board member becomes a director of a competitor of Teradyne, if the board member goes into government service or retires from the Board of Directors, such option may be exercised within its original terms. The 1996 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2006. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. The purpose of SAB 104 is to rescind the accounting guidance given in SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, related to multiple element arrangements, which was superceded as a result of EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The guidance in EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. 40 The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 150 (SFAS 150), Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability. For all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, SFAS 150 is effective immediately. For all other instruments, SFAS 150 goes into effect at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In April 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 149 (SFAS 149), Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies accounting and reporting of derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 146 (SFAS 146), Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In February 2003, FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21 (EITF 00 21), Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 requires revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting. If the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria, arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. Applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting. The guidance in EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as amended by FIN 46R, which addresses consolidation by a business of variable interest entities in which it is the primary beneficiary. The Interpretation is effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and the first quarter of fiscal 2004 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Teradyne does not have any variable interest entities. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results From time to time, information provided by Teradyne, statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Form 10 K) contain statements that are not purely historical, but are forward looking statements, made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, forward looking statements made herein include projections, plans and objectives for Teradynes business, financial condition, operating results, future operations, or future economic performance, statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to 41 meet working capital requirements, capital expenditures, expectations as to customer orders and demand for Teradynes products and statements relating to backlog, bookings and cancellations, gross margins and pricing considerations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, which could cause Teradynes actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. These factors, and others, are discussed from time to time in Teradynes filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Teradynes Business Is Impacted by the Slowdown in Economies Worldwide. Teradynes business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the global economies that began in the second half of 2000. The uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investments and may cause a further reduction of such investments. These reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which Teradyne serves and have contributed to Teradyne incurring losses. Teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound, or whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow. Current Geopolitical Turmoil and the Continuing Threat of Domestic and International Terrorist Attacks May Adversely Impact Teradynes Revenues. International turmoil, exacerbated by the war in Iraq and tensions in North Korea have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate, both in the United States and globally, which may affect Teradynes ability to generate revenue on a predictable basis. In addition, terrorist attacks internationally and the threat of future terrorist attacks both domestically and internationally have negatively impacted an already weakened worldwide economy. As Teradyne sells and manufacturers products both in the United States and internationally, the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase Teradynes operating costs and which may adversely affect Teradynes business. These conditions make it difficult for Teradyne, and its customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. Teradynes Business is Dependent on the Current and Anticipated Market for Electronics. Teradynes business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. The current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of 2000 and the effects of the hostilities begun in September 2001. Historically, the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply, which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment, including systems manufactured and marketed by Teradyne. Teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that Teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations. Teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Teradyne cannot assure that any increase in revenues or new orders for a calendar year will be sustained in subsequent years. In addition, any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and operating results. Teradyne Has Taken Measures to Address the Past Slowdown in the Market for Its Products Which Could Have Long term Negative Effects on Teradynes Business. Teradyne has taken measures to address the slowdown in the market for its products. In particular, Teradyne has reduced its workforce, closed and or sold facilities, discontinued certain of its product lines, implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense budgets. These 42 measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders. However, each measure Teradyne has taken to contain expenditures could have long term negative effects on Teradynes business by reducing its pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in its products, increasing Teradynes debt, and making it more difficult for Teradyne to respond to customers or competitors, as the market and customer orders turn around. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Adequately Address a Rapid Increase in Customer Demand Because Teradyne took measures during the past three years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services, and because visibility into Teradynes market is limited, Teradyne may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand, as the market turns around. Teradynes ability to meet increases in customer demand is, to a certain extent, dependant upon the ability of its suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements, which Teradyne has little or no control over. Teradynes Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Acquisitions Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has acquired a number of businesses. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations. Such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; the inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business; the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business; the possibility that Teradynes reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business; potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business, including but not limited to regulatory, environmental and tax liabilities; the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles, which may adversely affect Teradynes reported results of operations; and litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions. For example, in connection with the August 2000 acquisition of each of Herco Technology Corp., a California company, and Perception Laminates, Inc., a California company, a complaint was filed on or about September 5, 2001 and is now pending in Federal District Court, San Diego, California, by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants Teradyne and two of its executive officers. This case is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. Additionally, in 2001, Teradyne was designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a clean up site in Los Angeles, California. This claim arises out of Teradynes acquisition of Perception Laminates, Inc. in August 2000. Prior to that date, Perception Laminates had itself acquired certain assets of Alco Industries Inc. under an asset purchase agreement dated July 30, 1992. This case is further described in Part I, Environmental Affairs in this Form 10 K. In addition to the foregoing, any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to Teradynes expectations. 43 Teradyne Currently Faces, and in the Future May Be the Subject of, Securities Class Action Litigation Due to Past or Future Stock Price Volatility. Teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in Federal District Court, Boston, Massachusetts, in October and November 2001. The court consolidated the cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs. On November 8, 2002, plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by making, during the period from July 14, 2000 until October 17, 2000, material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding Teradynes business operations and future prospects. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Teradyne filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on February 7, 2003. On April 9, 2003, the lead plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to Teradynes motion to dismiss. On May 28, 2003, Teradyne filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint. Oral arguments in connection with Teradynes motion to dismiss were presented to the District Court on June 26, 2003. Claims asserted in this case are similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed above, which is pending in the Federal District Court in San Diego, California. On January 16, 2004, the U.S. Magistrate Judge recommended to the U.S. District Court that Teradynes motion to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint in its entirety be allowed without prejudice. On February 2, 2004, the lead plaintiffs filed an objection to the U.S. Magistrate Judges recommendation. Teradyne is currently preparing its response to the lead plaintiffs objection. Teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously. Management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on Teradynes financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. Teradynes Business May be Adversely Impacted by Divestitures of Lines of Business Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has divested itself of certain lines of business. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional divestitures. Such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business; restructuring, inventory and other charges which may affect Teradynes results of operations; and the decreased diversification of Teradynes product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make Teradynes operating results subject to increased market fluctuations. If Teradyne Is Unable to Protect Its Intellectual Property, Teradyne May Lose a Valuable Asset or May Incur Costly Litigation to Protect Its Rights. Teradynes products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets (IP). While Teradyne believes that its IP has value in the aggregate, no single element of its IP is in itself essential. If a significant portion of Teradynes IP is invalidated or ineffective, Teradynes business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, Teradyne receives notifications from time to time that it may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against Teradyne, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products, or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results. 44 If Teradyne Fails to Develop New Technologies to Adapt to Its Customers Needs and if Its Customers Fail to Accept Its New Products, Teradynes Revenues Will Be Adversely Affected. Teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers. Teradynes development of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to Teradynes success. Successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors, including: new product selection; development of competitive products by competitors; timely and efficient completion of product design; timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing; and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations. Teradyne Is Subject to Intense Competition. Teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments. Some of Teradynes competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers. Some of Teradynes competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those Teradyne currently offers. Teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of Teradynes products. Moreover, increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition, which could materially adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. Teradyne Is Subject to Risks of Operating Internationally. Teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the United States. The table set out below summarizes total Teradyne revenue earned within the United States (US) and outside the US (Non US) for the last three fiscal years: For the year ended December 31: 2003 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) US $ 503.8 37 % $ 561.1 46 % $ 733.6 51 % Non US $ 849.1 63 % $ 661.1 54 % $ 707.0 49 % Teradynes international revenues and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including: unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; changes in tariffs and exchange rates; social, political and economic instability, acts of terrorism and international conflicts; difficulties in accounts receivable collection; cultural differences in the conduct of business; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; potentially adverse tax consequences; and compliance with customs regulations. 45 In addition, an increasing portion of Teradynes products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations, including China, and a large portion of the devices Teradynes products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in Taiwan, Singapore, China and other parts of Asia. As a result, Teradyne is subject to a number of economic and other risks, particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions. Disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact Teradynes ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business. Teradynes Business May Suffer if it is Unable to Attract and Retain Key Employees. Competition for employees with skills required by Teradyne is intense in the high technology industry. Teradynes success will depend on its ability to attract and retain key technical employees. The loss of one or more key or other employees, Teradynes inability to attract additional qualified employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations or financial condition. If Teradynes Suppliers do not Meet Teradynes Product or Delivery Requirements, Teradyne Could Have Reduced Revenues and Earnings. Certain components, including semiconductor chips, may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet Teradynes quality or delivery requirements. Approximately 30% of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive. If any of Teradynes suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments with Teradyne or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for Teradynes products, Teradyne could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Teradyne relies upon contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in its products, and Teradynes ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom Teradyne does not exercise any control. In addition, Teradyne is dependent on the financial strength of its suppliers. For example, on September 24, 2003, a supplier of Teradyne filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. While the loss of this supplier has not had a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that the loss of other Teradyne suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations or financial condition. Teradyne May Incur Significant Liabilities if It Fails to Comply With Environmental Regulations. Teradyne is subject to environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes. If Teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations, or is required to perform site remediation, Teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also: restrict Teradynes ability to expand its facilities; require Teradyne to acquire costly equipment; or require Teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses. Pursuant to present regulations and agreements, Teradyne is conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and is implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2003, Teradyne has not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire sites. 46 Teradyne Has Substantially Increased Its Indebtedness. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne completed a private placement of $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due 2006 and received net proceeds of $389 million. As a result, Teradyne has incurred approximately $400 million principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization. The level of Teradynes indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for Teradyne to make payments on its debt and other obligations; make it difficult for Teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; limit Teradynes flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, its business and the industries in which Teradyne competes; place Teradyne at a competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and make Teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business. There can be no assurance that Teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Satisfy Certain Obligations in the Event of a Change in Control. The indenture governing the Notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of Teradyne. If a change in control occurs, the holders of the Notes have the right to require Teradyne to repurchase all of the Notes not previously called for redemption. The price that Teradyne is required to pay is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, together with interest accrued but unpaid to, but excluding, the repurchase date. At Teradynes option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, instead of paying the repurchase price in cash, it may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at 95% of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date. If Teradyne is required to repurchase the Notes, there is no guarantee that it will have enough funds to pay such amounts. As a result, a change of control of Teradyne could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Pay Its Debt and Other Obligations. If Teradynes cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations, Teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems. If Teradyne sustains continued losses or is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes or certain of its other obligations, Teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness Teradyne may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, Teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the Notes payment if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations. Moreover, Teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes at maturity. 47 Teradyne May Need Additional Financing, Which Could Be Difficult to Obtain. Teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet Teradynes cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. However, Teradyne has a finite amount of cash and in the event Teradyne may need to raise additional funds, due to on going losses or other reasons, Teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, particularly in light of Teradynes continued quarterly losses. Further, if Teradyne issues additional equity securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Future financings may place restrictions on how Teradyne operates its business. If Teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, Teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow its business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm Teradynes business. If Teradyne is Required to Account for Options Under Its Employee Stock Plans as a Compensation Expense, Teradynes Compensation Expense Would Be Increased. There has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options. Teradyne currently discloses pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net loss and net loss per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements. If future laws and regulations require Teradyne to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations, its reported operating results will be adversely affected. Note B: Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on Teradynes net loss and net loss per share if it had been in effect during the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are additional stock based compensation disclosures. Provisions of Teradynes Charter and By Laws and Massachusetts Law Make a Takeover of Teradyne More Difficult. Teradynes basic corporate documents, its stockholder rights plan and Massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of Teradyne, even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of Teradynes stockholders. Teradynes Operating Results Are Likely to Fluctuate Significantly. Teradynes annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability. With respect to the operating results for the year ending December 31, 2003, the following factors materially and adversely affected revenues and profitability: competitive pressures on selling prices; provisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products; and impairment charges for certain long lived assets; The above factors, in conjunction with the additional factors set out below are expected to impact future operations: Teradynes ability to introduce and the market acceptance of new products planned for 2004 and beyond; changes in product revenue mix resulting from changes in customer demand; the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter resulting from the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and 48 constraints occurring at the end of a quarter, or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business; engineering and development investments relating to the new product introductions in 2004, new product introductions planned for 2005 and the expansion of manufacturing and engineering operations in Asia; and ability of Teradynes suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for Teradyne products, especially if product demand increases rapidly. In particular, due to Teradynes introduction of a number of new, complex test systems in 2003 and the planned introduction of other systems in 2004, there can be no assurance that Teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, Teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Teradynes Investor Confidence and Share Value May Be Adversely Impacted if Teradynes independent auditors are unable to provide Teradyne with the attestation of the adequacy of Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10 K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, Teradynes independent auditors must attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting. This requirement will first apply to Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004. Although Teradyne intends to diligently and vigorously review its internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, if Teradynes independent auditors are not satisfied with Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules and or regulations differently from Teradyne, then they may decline to attest to managements assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of Teradynes financial statements, which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of Teradynes shares. 49 Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in European and Japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position. Forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy U.S. dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was $5.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively. A 10% fluctuation in exchange rates for 2003 and 2002 currencies would change the fair value by approximately $0.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively. However, since these contracts hedge non U.S. currency assets and liabilities, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged. The hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk Management Teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. Debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Since the Notes were out of the money at year end, they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored. On this basis, the potential loss on the fair value of debt was not material at December 31, 2003, and was $9.4 million at December 31, 2002. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On this basis, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $2.3 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 50 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of Teradynes plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Teradynes actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, managment evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to Teradynes customers upon shipment. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, Teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur. For equipment where there is hardware and software that is incidental to the product, revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require Teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, Teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered 18 item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of Teradyne. Teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Teradynes post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. Teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and Teradyne defers revenue in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 90 1. Teradynes products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. Teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. Connection Systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements. Teradyne generally does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position No. 97 2 SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Revenue is deferred in instances when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements is not determinable. Vendor specific evidence of fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. 19 Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans Teradyne accounts for its employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Teradynes employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan. Teradynes stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. There have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of the employee stock purchase plan under Teradynes stock plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid in capital. Teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. See Note B: Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at December 31, 2003. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence, including profitability, exists that realization is more likely than not. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets Teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors Teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of Teradynes use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When Teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, Teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. Teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The volatility of the industries that Teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows, which can impact their ability to make required payments. Teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customers current payment history, the customers current financial statements and other information regarding the customers credit worthiness. If the financial condition of Teradynes customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 20 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Percentage of net revenue: Net Revenue: Products 82.5 % 81.2 % 85.6 % Service 17.5 18.8 14.4 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Expenses: Cost of products 59.0 67.9 70.5 Cost of service 11.5 13.1 10.1 Total cost of revenue 70.5 81.0 80.6 Engineering and development 18.8 24.0 20.0 Selling and administrative 18.4 23.8 18.7 Restructuring and other charges 5.3 10.3 5.2 Goodwill impairment 6.4 Gain on the sale of a business (1.0 ) 113.0 145.5 123.5 Net interest and other (expense) income (0.7 ) (0.4 ) 0.9 Loss before income taxes (13.7 ) (45.9 ) (22.6 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 0.6 12.9 (8.6 ) Net loss (14.3 )% (58.8 )% (14.0 )% Results of Operations: Business Overview Teradynes operating results were adversely affected by the recent severe technology and semiconductor downturn which affected the semiconductor industry and caused a general reduction in capital spending. As a result of the challenging economic conditions, Teradyne has taken significant cost structure initiatives to more appropriately size the business. Actions taken include: reductions in workforce across all groups which has led to the consolidation and reorganization of certain functions, curtailment of discretionary expenses, shifts of manufacturing and some shared services operations to lower cost regions, reductions in the number of operating facilities and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing and applications development. In addition, Teradyne has eliminated certain product lines to efficiently allocate engineering and development spending to areas that provide a high potential for growth. Recent increases in business activity indicate that the industry is in the midst of a recovery leading to the next growth cycle. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Teradynes net bookings increased 45% sequentially, and worldwide semiconductor test utilization levels climbed to levels which had not been seen since the past business peak in 2000. Although sales remained relatively flat throughout the four quarters of 2003, net bookings increased almost 40% from the first to the second half of the year. 21 Bookings Teradynes net orders for its four principal operating segments for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PercentChange 2001 2002PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 837.9 $ 480.5 $ 294.0 74 % 63 % Connection Systems 317.7 149.8 385.0 112 (61 ) Assembly Test Systems 156.6 167.8 101.4 (7 ) 65 Other Test Systems 105.9 107.2 27.8 (1 ) 286 $ 1,418.1 $ 905.3 $ 808.2 57 % 12 % From 2002 to 2003, the growth in orders shifted more heavily to Subcons in Taiwan, Singapore and other parts of Asia. During the last quarter of 2003, Teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs for the wireless and baseband industries, whose chips are sold mainly by European and U.S. semiconductor companies. These chips are fabricated and tested by Foundries and Subcons in many parts of Asia, but concentrated in Taiwan and Singapore and increasingly in China. The economic downturn which prevailed in the past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs. As a result, an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource their non core competency testing needs to Subcons in low cost regions. As Teradynes total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings have grown, the bookings from Subcons have continued to make up a larger percentage of total orders. Bookings from Subcons increased 325% from $72 million in 2002 to $307 million in 2003 and made up 37% of total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings in 2003 compared to 15% of total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings in 2002. In 2001, excess inventory, slower economic growth and a reduction in end user demand of electronic goods by Teradynes Semiconductor Test Systems customers resulted in a reduction in capital spending as well as cancellations or postponements of previously placed orders. From 2001 to 2002, Semiconductor Test Systems bookings grew primarily as a result of increased demand for SOC products by both IDMs and Subcons. The increase in Connection Systems bookings from 2002 to 2003 was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in 2003, as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market, driven by wireless network deployments, which increased appreciably for both U.S. and European telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003. Teradynes high speed high density interconnect and backplane solutions, such as VHDM HSD, are well positioned in this market. Bookings were up modestly in the computer/server market, and down in the storage market as Connection Systems exited a lower margin EMS product line and repositioned itself to support its core products. From 2001 to 2002, bookings were impacted by significant cancellations along with a decline in demand of over 50% from key communications customers year over year. The net decrease in Assembly Test Systems orders from 2002 to 2003 is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines. This decrease was offset by a 25% increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the Mil/Aero business, which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of 2003. The increase in orders from 2001 to 2002 largely resulted from the full year impact of the GenRad acquisition. The first half of 2001 had strong orders from contract manufacturers in the in circuit test business but demand weakened as a result of the sluggish economy in the latter half of 2001 and into 2002. The increase in Other Test Systems bookings from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the addition of Diagnostic Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the acquisition of GenRad, which includes Diagnostic Systems, which is included in the Other Test Systems segment. 22 Teradynes cancellations for its four principal operating segments for the last three years are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 6.9 $ 52.5 $ 80.2 Connection Systems 16.0 104.3 193.0 Assembly Test Systems 2.5 2.2 2.5 Other Test Systems 9.8 $ 25.4 $ 159.0 $ 285.5 The Semiconductor Test Systems cancellations were largely due to orders that were booked in late 2000 and early 2001 by Subcons in anticipation of a further increase in their own demand. Cancellations in the Connection Systems business came from major customers in the telecommunication and information technology infrastructure industries, as their own demand levels dropped. Teradynes net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows: 2003 2002 2001 United States 35 % 44 % 55 % Europe 17 18 24 South East Asia 18 13 10 Singapore 11 8 3 Taiwan 10 6 3 Japan 8 9 3 Rest of the World 1 2 2 100 % 100 % 100 % For the past three years, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its four principal operating segments is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 333.7 $ 240.0 $ 317.2 Connection Systems 75.6 104.2 357.6 Assembly Test Systems 56.1 53.4 55.5 Other Test Systems 40.7 43.3 32.7 $ 506.1 $ 440.9 $ 763.0 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2003, 2002, and 2001 there were no significant cancellation penalties received. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, Teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, financial condition, and results of operations. Revenue Teradynes net revenue for its four principal operating segments for 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PercentChange 2001 2002PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 735.4 $ 557.5 $ 717.7 32 % (22 )% Connection Systems 357.2 397.0 540.8 (10 ) (27 ) Assembly Test Systems 151.6 170.8 132.4 (11 ) 29 Other Test Systems 108.7 96.9 49.7 12 95 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 $ 1,440.6 11 % (15 )% 23 More than half of the Semiconductor Test Systems sales increase from 2002 to 2003 is attributable to growing sales to Subcons for use in their Asian facilities, primarily Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. The revenue derived from Subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal SOC customers, led by sales of Catalyst and Tiger systems. As is described in the Bookings section, Semiconductor Test Systems has seen a recent growth in revenue due to increased need for testing in the wireless and baseband sectors. To a lesser extent, the Semiconductor Test Systems segment continues to see revenue growth in the optical disk sector, automotive applications testing, and image sensor testing. Included in 2001 Semiconductor Test Systems sales is $98.7 million from the accounting impact of the implementation of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements in the fourth quarter of 2000 due to shipments of customer orders in 2000 where title was retained by Teradyne until customer payment in order to perfect a security interest. Connection Systems sales declined from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin EMS business. The segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years. The increase in Assembly Test Systems revenue from 2001 to 2002 largely resulted from the full year impact of the GenRad acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2001. From the second half of 2001 through 2003, the commercial business saw decreases in revenue, particularly in the in circuit test business, while the Mil/Aero business has seen steady revenue numbers throughout the past three years. The increase in Other Test Systems revenue from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the addition of Diagnostic Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the acquisition of GenRad, which includes Diagnostic Solutions, which is included in the Other Test Systems segment. Teradynes four principal operating segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of last three years: 2003 2002 2001 Semiconductor Test Systems 55 % 46 % 50 % Connection Systems 26 32 38 Assembly Test Systems 11 14 9 Other Test Systems 8 8 3 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 United States 37 % 46 % 51 % Europe 17 18 19 South East Asia 17 11 9 Singapore 11 8 4 Taiwan 9 9 10 Japan 8 6 4 Rest of the World 1 2 3 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PercentChange 2001 2002PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Product Revenue $ 1,115.9 $ 992.1 $ 1,233.7 12 % (20 )% Service Revenue 237.0 230.1 206.9 3 11 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 $ 1,440.6 11 % (15 )% 24 Service revenue is derived from the servicing of Teradynes installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2003, 2002, and 2001, Teradynes three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21%, 23% and 24% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Gross Margin 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003PointChange 2001 2002PointChange (dollars in millions) Gross Margin $ 398.9 $ 232.7 $ 278.8 Percent of Total Revenue 29.5 % 19.0 % 19.4 % 10.5 (0.4 ) Teradynes gross margin improvement from 2002 to 2003 was impacted by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, lower inventory provisions, and volume and product mix. Gross margin improvement of 4.9 points is attributed to reduced fixed manufacturing costs, including depreciation and facility costs resulting from restructuring actions primarily taken in the second half of 2002, along with increased sales volumes which resulted in higher utilization. An improvement of 2.5 points of gross margin is credited to a shift in Teradynes mix of revenues, with a higher percentage in 2003 being derived from Semiconductor Test Systems which has higher incremental margins, coupled with a shift in Teradynes supply chain to low cost regions. Inventory provisions decreased from $39.0 million in 2002 to $16.6 million in 2003, which contributed a 2.0 point gross margin improvement. Teradynes gross margin remained relatively flat from 2001 to 2002, and was impacted by a variety of factors including lower inventory provisions, offset by pricing pressures and lower utilization of fixed manufacturing costs as sales volumes decreased. Inventory provisions decreased from $139.7 million in 2001 to $39.0 million in 2002, which contributed a 6.5 point gross margin improvement. As sales volumes decreased from 2001 to 2002 and certain components of cost of revenues remained fixed, gross margin was negatively impacted by 1.8 points due to the lower utilization of manufacturing overhead. Pricing pressures, net of product mix and cost reduction activities in the second half of 2002 resulted in a 1.6 point decrease in gross margin.

Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are 25 not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. The activity with respect to the provisions recorded for excess and obsolete inventory for 2003, 2002, and 2001 is as follows: (in thousands) Inventory provisions for 2003 $ 16,569 Inventory scrapped Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 16,569 Inventory provisions for 2002 $ 39,021 Inventory scrapped (7,005 ) Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2002 32,016 Inventory scrapped (7,838 ) Inventory sold (3,989 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 20,189 Inventory provisions for 2001 $ 139,683 Inventory scrapped (33,897 ) Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2001 105,786 Inventory scrapped (15,782 ) Inventory sold Balance at December 31, 2002 90,004 Inventory scrapped (22,488 ) Inventory sold (1,295 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 66,221 Teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory. The yearly provisions consisted of obsolete and excess inventory as follows: ExcessInventory ObsoleteInventory TotalProvision (in millions) 2003 Provision $ 7.4 $ 9.2 $ 16.6 2002 Provision 28.1 10.9 39.0 2001 Provision 44.4 95.3 139.7 Teradynes writedowns and write offs consisted of raw material and components. The provisions were accounted for in the following segments: 2003 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 5.2 31 % $ 27.9 71 % $ 118.6 85 % Connection Systems 1.6 10 % 3.8 10 % 15.5 11 % Assembly Test Systems 9.3 56 % 7.0 18 % 5.6 4 % Other Test Systems 0.5 3 % 0.3 1 % 0 % Total $ 16.6 100 % $ 39.0 100 % $ 139.7 100 % 26 Of the inventory provision recorded in 2003, $9.3 million relates to Assembly Test Systems which includes $3.6 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing, distributing and primary support of the AOI product line and $5.2 million relates to Semiconductor Test Systems SOC parts and components. Of the inventory provision recorded in 2002 for Semiconductor Test Systems, $20.7 million was in memory test related to Probe One and J996 product line discontinuances. The Probe One and J996 inventory has been fully written off as of December 31, 2003. There is no material exposure remaining for the Probe One or J996 products. The total 2001 inventory provision for excess and obsolete inventory was $139.7 million and was principally due to the sharp decline in incoming Semiconductor Test Systems and Connection Systems orders. Of the 2001 provision for Semiconductor Test Systems, $86.3 million was related to SOC parts and $32.3 million was for memory product parts and components related to an inventory writedown for the discontinuance of Teradynes Flash 750 memory product. Teradyne currently does not believe there is any material remaining exposure for the other products that Teradyne continues to actively market, although our estimates of future demand may differ from actual demand which may result in additional provisions. As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, Teradyne had inventory related reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of $191.1 million and $220.8 million, respectively. Engineering and Development 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003Change 2001 2002Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 254.6 $ 293.9 $ 287.3 $ (39.3 ) $ 6.6 Percent of Total Revenue 18.8 % 24.0 % 20.0 % Throughout the downturn, Teradyne has maintained its commitment to sustained levels of investment in research through continued engineering and development spending. More than two thirds of Teradynes total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between $150 $250 million. During the past three years, Semiconductor Test Systems has reduced the number of platforms under major development, which has increased the resources for remaining platforms. The consolidation of multiple product divisions within Semiconductor Test Systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation. Semiconductor Test Systems has consolidated engineering facilities, outsourced certain software engineering development to a low cost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce overall costs. The reduction in engineering and development expenses from 2002 to 2003 resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within Semiconductor Test Systems and Assembly Test Systems. The elimination of memory test within the Semiconductor Test Systems segment resulted in a reduction of $13 million and $5 million in engineering expenses from 2001 to 2002 and 2002 to 2003, respectively. As a result of the sale in Assembly Test Systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products, engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003 decreased by approximately $15 million. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts: $16 million as a result of a workforce reduction, partially offset by a $10 million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases in the third quarter of 2002; 27 $13 million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering as a result of the decision to use internal resources; $4 million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the recent writedown of assets, as well as the trend to rent or lease, rather than purchase, development tools; and $3 million from reduced office and facility costs as a result of recent cost saving actions. The increase in spending from 2001 to 2002 in engineering and development was primarily due to: $23 million as a result of the additional expense base resulting from Teradynes purchase of GenRad in the fourth quarter of 2001; and $6 million from the granting of the prior years previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of 2002. The additional engineering and development expense in 2001 compared to 2002 was partially offset by actions taken to reduce costs which consist of the following: $16 million as a result of a workforce reduction; $7 million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering as a result of the decision to use internal resources; $5 million for a reduction in prototype engineering materials; and $2 million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the writedown of assets.

The increase in spending from 2001 to 2002 in selling and administrative was principally due to the additional expense base resulting from Teradynes purchase of GenRad in the fourth quarter of 2001 with an additional increase coming from the granting of the prior years previously frozen salary increases during the third quarter of 2002. The additional selling and administrative expense was partially offset by workforce reductions and other actions taken to reduce costs which consisted of the following: $7 million from a reduction in promotional spending and travel cutbacks. $5 million from a reduction in consulting spending; and 28 Restructuring and Other Charges The table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended December 31, 2003 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment SeveranceandBenefits Loss onSale ofProductLines FacilityRelated OtherCharges Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 8,242 $ $ 25,240 $ $ 33,482 2003 provision 29,403 21,367 6,891 12,350 1,273 71,284 Cash payments (21,843 ) (8,368 ) (30,211 ) Asset writedowns (29,403 ) (6,891 ) (36,294 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ $ 7,766 $ $ 29,222 $ 1,273 $ 38,261 The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. Teradyne expects to pay out $7 million against the lease accrual over the next twelve months. Teradynes future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $13 million as of December 31, 2003. Teradyne has subleased approximately 16% of its unoccupied space as of December 31, 2003 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space. Prior to January 1, 2003, Teradyne recorded restructuring charges for its unoccupied facilities leased under operating leases at the time Teradyne committed to the plan to permanently vacate the facilities. The restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment after the facilities were to be vacated net of Teradynes estimated probable sublease income. For actions initiated after January 1, 2003, the restructuring charges were based on the difference between the remaining contractual lease commitment net of Teradynes estimated probable sublease income once Teradyne ceased using the facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded charges of $29.4 million primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets. The charges include the following: $11.2 million for the reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale; $11.2 million related primarily to the sale and leaseback of manufacturing assets; and $7.0 million related primarily to manufacturing assets and equipment. The charge for reduction in the fair value of the properties held for sale resulted from a deterioration in real estate market conditions. The carrying value of Teradynes assets, primarily manufacturing equipment, held for sale was $0.2 million as of December 31, 2003. The carrying value of Teradynes assets held for sale was $45.3 million as of December 31, 2002. These assets were included in Property, Plant and Equipment. As of December 31, 2003, all of the properties held for sale had been sold. Teradyne owns approximately 226,000 square feet of unoccupied space as of December 31, 2003 at its North Reading, MA facility that Teradyne expects to utilize for future expansion. Teradyne has not recorded any impairment charges for this temporarily idle facility. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during the year ended December 31, 2003 of $21.4 million. There were approximately 890 employees terminated in the year ended December 31, 2003 across all functional groups at Teradyne. All remaining severance benefits payable to these employees are expected to be paid by the end of the fourth quarter of 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded a charge of $8.1 million for the loss on sale of product lines, of which $6.9 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges and $1.2 million has been recorded in cost of revenues. In the first quarter of 2003, the Assembly Test Systems segment sold its 29 manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line for total cash proceeds of $2.1 million. These transactions resulted in a loss of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Teradyne decided to sell the manufacturing software product line and the manual x ray inspection and rework product line because the product lines were not able to generate sufficient levels of revenue and earnings growth. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Other Test Systems segment recorded a charge of $1.4 million to writedown its net assets relating to the sale of the Autodiagnos automotive after market product. Autodiagnos was a part of the Diagnostic Solutions segment, which is a supplier of automotive manufacturing and service bay test and diagnostic systems. The Autodiagnos product line was selling to the independent repair market. With changes in legislation and consolidations in the automotive industry it became evident that this may have resulted in Autodiagnos being in direct competition with some of Diagnostic Solutions major customers. Strategically, Teradyne decided to sell Autodiagnos to negate this conflict and concentrate on its core business. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded a charge of $12.4 million consisting primarily of revised estimates of the amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded a charge of $1.3 million primarily for contractual penalties associated with resizing the Connection Systems business. The accrual for contractual penalties is reflected in other accrued liabilities. The restructuring actions taken during 2003 are expected to generate cost savings of approximately $86.3 million annually across all areas of operations. The table below summarizes activity for the year ended December 31, 2002 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment FacilityRelated Severance and Benefits Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ $ 1,676 8,471 $ 10,147 2002 provision 76,994 25,751 22,495 125,240 Cash payments (2,187 ) (22,724 ) (24,911 ) Asset writedowns (76,994 ) (76,994 ) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 25,240 $ 8,242 $ 33,482 During 2002, Teradyne recorded charges of $77.0 million primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets. The charges included machinery and equipment, facilities held for sale and intangible assets (see Note L: Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). All of the machinery and equipment and facilities have been sold or disposed of as of December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a charge of $25.8 million relating to future lease commitments for vacated manufacturing and administrative space which have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. The lease accruals are expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during 2002 of $22.5 million. There were approximately 1,010 employees terminated across all functional groups during 2002. All remaining severance benefits payable to these employees are expected to be paid by the end of the first quarter of 2004. 30 The table below summarizes activity for the year ended December 31, 2001, relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment FacilityRelated Severance and Benefits Total (in thousands) 2001 provision $ 35,338 $ 1,676 $ 37,278 $ 74,292 Cash payments (28,807 ) (28,807 ) Asset writedowns (35,338 ) (35,338 ) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ $ 1,676 $ 8,471 $ 10,147 During the year ended December 31, 2001, Teradyne recorded a charge of $35.3 million for impaired long lived assets, consisting of a held for sale facility, manufacturing assets and equipment manufactured by Teradyne used in manufacturing and engineering and development relating to the discontinuance of a product line. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Teradyne recorded charges for vacated office space under operating leases of $1.7 million. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and long term other accrued liabilities. Teradyne recorded a charge for severance and related benefits during 2001 of $37.3 million. There were approximately 2,900 employees terminated across all functional groups. As of December 31, 2002, Teradyne had paid all severance benefits relating to the 2001 terminations. For further details on Teradynes restructuring and other charges during 2003, 2002 and 2001 see Note L: Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Impairment Unless conditions dictate otherwise, Teradynes annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Teradyne tested both reporting units, Assembly Test Systems and Connection Systems, for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the quarter ended September 28, 2003, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for the fiscal years 2004 through 2006 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 112 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 28, 2003. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. During the quarter ended September 29, 2002, as a result of contraction in the Assembly Test Systems market to its lowest level in a decade as evidenced by various market reports available to Teradyne, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 94 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 29, 2002. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment exceeded its fair value and recognized a $78.5 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment to its carrying value. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. 31 Gain on the Sale of a Business On June 22, 2001, Teradyne sold its aerospace and defense connector and backplane business to Amphenol Corporation of Wallingford, Connecticut for cash proceeds of $26.3 million. This transaction resulted in a gain of $14.8 million. Interest Income and Expense 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003Change 2001 2002Change (in millions) Interest income $ 14.0 $ 17.0 $ 22.7 $ (3.0 ) $ (5.7 ) Interest expense $ (20.9 ) $ (21.8 ) $ (4.1 ) $ 0.9 $ (17.7 ) The decrease in interest income from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to lower interest rates. The decrease in interest expense from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of Teradynes California mortgage in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in interest expense from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to interest expense related to convertible notes which Teradyne issued in the fourth quarter of 2001. Other Income and Expense, Net Other income and expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 includes the following: Income/(expense) 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Mortgage prepayment penalty (1) $ (3,220 ) Other than temporary impairment of investment (2,592 ) Gain on sale of investment 2,800 Repayment of loan by divested entity (2) $ 7,144 Other than temporary impairment of common stock investment (3,115 ) Writedown of investment in an engineering service provider (2,288 ) $ (1,800 ) Fair value adjustment on warrants 138 (2,051 ) 2,035 Equity investment (3) (6,974 ) Total $ (2,874 ) $ (310 ) $ (6,739 ) (1) Penalties related to prepayment of a $45 million mortgage loan collateralized against certain California real estate properties, which was to mature on January 1, 2007. (2) The loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection. (3) Teradynes proportionate share of a loss related to an equity investment in Empirix, Inc. The carrying value of this equity investment was zero at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased primarily due to increased revenues from 2002 to 2003. The increase in the loss before income taxes from 2001 to 2002 in Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems and Assembly Test Systems was due to decreased sales in Semiconductor Test Systems and Connection Systems, and goodwill and intangible asset impairments in Assembly Test Systems and the declining market conditions. Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased due to the addition of Diagnostic Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2001 as part of the GenRad acquisition. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2003, tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes. Teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003. Until sufficient positive evidence exists, including an appropriate level of profitability, Teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision of $157.5 million resulting in a tax rate of 28%. The tax rate of 28% is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. The evidence that Teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2002 included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year 2002 compared to earlier Teradyne forecasts, the inability to get to break even during 2002 despite implementing several restructuring programs, and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year 2003. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized. The effective tax rate benefit for the year ended 2001 was 38%. Teradynes effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily reflects the U.S. statutory income tax rate, the net effect of state taxes and the effect of tax benefits from its Ireland manufacturing operations. Tax exemptions relating to Ireland operations are effective through 2010.

Pension funding requirements are not known beyond 2004. 33 Liquidity and Capital Resources Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $44.9 million in 2003 from 2002, to $586.0 million. Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $45.1 million in 2002 from 2001, to $541.1 million and increased $121.8 million in 2001 from 2000, to $586.2 million. Cash activity for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows: 2003 2002 2001 2002 2003Change 2001 2002Change Cash provided by (used for) operating activities: Cash provided by (used for) net loss, adjusted for non cash items: $ 15.3 $ (207.4 ) $ 57.8 $ 222.7 $ (265.2 ) Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired 18.9 203.1 (136.8 ) (184.2 ) 339.9 Total cash provided by (used for) operating activities 34.2 (4.3 ) (79.0 ) 38.5 74.7 Cash used for investing activities (114.4 ) (102.2 ) (247.3 ) (12.2 ) 145.1 Cash provided by financing activities 57.1 40.4 401.5 16.7 (361.1 ) Total $ (23.1 ) $ (66.1 ) $ 75.2 $ 43.0 $ (141.3 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired provided cash of $18.9 million in 2003 as inventory balances decreased $56.3 million across each of Teradynes segments, although primarily in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, and accounts payable, deferred revenue and accruals increased by $24.0 million due to the increase in business in the fourth quarter of 2003, which is partially offset by a contribution to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan of approximately $10 million. The inventory and accounts payable, deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by an increase of $58.3 million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding, based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues, from 47.8 days in 2002 to 58.6 days in 2003. Teradyne plans to contribute $25 million to its U.S. Qualified Pension Plan in 2004. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $203.1 million in 2002 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of $93.7 million across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund of $85.2 million in March of 2002. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $136.8 million in 2001 as accounts payable, deferred revenue and accruals balances decreased as purchases slowed but were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory due to market conditions. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, proceeds for asset disposals, proceeds from the sale of product lines, cash acquired in business acquisitions, cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures increased by $4.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002. All operating segments increased capital expenditures, except the Connection Systems segment which decreased capital expenditures by $9.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in capital expenditures in the other segments was driven by an increase in equipment manufactured by Teradyne. Capital expenditures were $81.2 million in 2003, $76.4 million in 2002, and $241.4 million in 2001. Financing activities include the issuance of convertible notes, mortgage borrowings, sales of Teradynes common stock, as well as repayments of debt. During 2003, repayments of long term debt used cash of $43.4 million as Teradyne prepaid its mortgage on its California properties in the third quarter of 2003. In 2001, Teradyne assumed debt of $89.7 million from the GenRad acquisition which Teradyne repaid on October 26, 2001. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $100.5 million, $41.2 million, and $58.5 million, respectively. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne issued $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 (the Notes) in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 34 $26.00 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Teradyne began making annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Teradyne that rank equally with Teradynes existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In the event of a change in control by which Teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, the holders of the Notes may be able to require Teradyne to redeem some or all of the Notes either in discounted Teradyne common stock or in cash. On February 8, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a Registration Statement on Form S 3 covering both the Notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted. On or after October 18, 2004, Teradyne may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below. The redemption price, expressed as a percentage of principal amount, is as follows for the designated periods: Period Redemption Price Beginning on October 18, 2004 and ending on October 14, 2005 101.50 % Beginning on October 15, 2005 and ending on October 14, 2006 100.75 % and thereafter equal to 100% of the principal amount. Presently, it is managements intent to convert a portion of the Notes into equity at or around October 18, 2004, if Teradynes stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, to avoid the continuation of the annual interest payment of $15 million. However, there can be no assurance that even if Teradynes stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the Notes will convert into equity as Teradynes stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date. If this were to occur, Teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the Notes called into cash. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including Teradynes stock price, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities and Teradynes anticipated future liquidity needs. On December 19, 2001, Teradyne obtained a loan of approximately $45 million in the form of a 7.5% mortgage loan on its California properties maturing on January 1, 2007 (the Mortgage). Teradyne prepaid the Mortgage in the third quarter of 2003. Prior to the prepayment, principal payments were made according to a twenty year amortization schedule through December 2006, with the remaining principal due on January 1, 2007. On October 26, 2001, Teradyne completed its acquisition of GenRad, Inc. of Westford, MA, a leading manufacturer of electronic automatic test equipment, related software, and diagnostic solutions. GenRads business has been made part of the Assembly Test Systems operating segment excluding the Diagnostic Solutions business. Diagnostic Solutions has been made part of the Other Test Systems operating segment. Under the terms of the acquisition, each outstanding share of GenRad common stock was converted into 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock. The total number of Teradyne shares exchanged for the shares of GenRad, based on the shares of GenRad outstanding as of the closing, was approximately 5.0 million. Teradyne believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $586.0 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $25 million in 2004 to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan which is currently under funded. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans Teradynes pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit plan, was approximately $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which was 0.93% of Teradynes total operating expenses. The largest portion of Teradynes 2003 pension expense was $8.2 million for its U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, which is calculated 35 based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected return on plan assets for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets of 8%. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, Teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Teradyne also considered its historical 15 year compounded return of 8% for the period ending December 31, 2002, which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Based on these historical returns, Teradyne believes that 8% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2003. The current asset allocation for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 47% invested in equity securities and 53% invested in fixed income securities. Teradynes actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2003 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model. Teradynes investment manager regularly reviews Teradynes actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances Teradynes investments to Teradynes targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust these returns as necessary. Teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2003 in the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan Teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately $17.0 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that Teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index, which was at 6.00% at December 31, 2003, down from 6.05% at December 31, 2002. As a result, Teradyne selected 6% for its December 31, 2003 discount rate, which was the same as from December 31, 2002. Each year Teradyne considers the Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index, along with other indices including the Moodys AA rated corporate bond yield and the Salomon Brothers 10+ Year AAA/AA rate. Teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan will be approximately $6.3 million, $6.6 million and $6.5 million in fiscal 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The pension expense estimates are based on a 6% discount rate. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in Teradynes pension plans. Teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2003, if Teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 5% 6% 7% (in millions) 7% $ 12.7 $ 9.6 $ 6.9 8% 11.4 8.2 5.6 9% 10.1 6.9 4.3 Teradynes funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $98.2 million at December 31, 2002 to $121.6 million at December 31, 2003. The investment performance returns and Teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $93.4 million at December 31, 2002 to $70.9 million at December 31, 2003. During 2003, Teradyne contributed $10 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $25 million in 2004 to this plan in order to meet the ERISA minimum funding requirements. 36 Employee Stock Options Teradynes equity compensation program is a broad based, long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Teradyne considers its equity compensation program critical to Teradynes operation and productivity. Approximately 83% of Teradynes employees participate in its equity compensation program. Of the stock options Teradyne granted in 2003, 88% went to employees other than the Chief Executive Officer and the five other most highly compensated executive officers.

Equity Compensation Plans In addition to Teradynes 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note P: Stock Based Compensation, Teradyne maintains three equity compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance to Teradynes employees, directors and or consultants: 1) 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan; 2) 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan; and 3) 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan. 38 The purpose of these plans is to promote the interests of Teradyne by attracting and retaining the services of qualified and talented persons to serve as employees, directors and or consultants of Teradyne. Except for the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of the foregoing plans was approved by Teradynes shareholders. The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2003: (1) (2) (3) Plan category Number of securities to be issued uponexercise ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Weighted average exercise price ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Number of securities remaining available for future issuanceunder stock option compensationplans (excluding securitiesreflected in column(1)) (shares in thousands) Stock option plans approved by shareholders 5,411 $ 23.59 2,891 Stock option plans not approved by shareholders(1) 24,157 22.28 18,510 Total 29,568 $ 22.52 21,401 (1) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), Teradyne assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of Teradyne common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock for each share of GenRad common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2003, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 355 shares of Teradyne common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $72.32 per share. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan) Under the 1991 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options which qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (ISOs) and non qualified stock options (NQOs), up to a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. ISOs may be granted only to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries and NQOs may be granted to employees, consultants and directors who are also employees of Teradyne. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 200,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted options to purchase, in the aggregate, more than 300,000 shares of common stock under the 1991 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1991 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an option whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the option, its exercise price and other pertinent terms, including vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each option may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees option may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1991 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2011. The 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) Under the 1997 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue ISOs to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries, and NQOs, stock awards and authorizations to purchase Teradyne common stock to employees, consultants or directors (provided that no options may be granted to non employee directors) up to a maximum of 53,000,000 39 shares. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 400,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted an option to acquire more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1997 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an award, the pertinent terms of such award, including, if such award is an option, whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the award, its exercise price and vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each award may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees award may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1997 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2007. Options granted prior to September 2001 under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of five years. Beginning in September 2001, options granted under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of seven years. In addition, Teradyne made a one time grant to all employees under the 1991 and 1997 Plans that vests over two years and has a term of seven years. 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 1996 Plan) Each non employee director of Teradyne is entitled to participate in the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options to purchase up to a maximum of 1,600,000 shares of common stock. The 1996 Plan provides for the automatic grant (i) of an option to purchase 25,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each non employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors on or after August 26, 1999, (ii) on February 5, 2001, of an option to purchase 6,750 shares of Teradyne common stock to each person who was a non employee director on February 7, 2000, (iii) on February 5, 2001, of an option to purchase 15,750 shares of Teradyne common stock to each non employee who became a new member of the Board during February 2000, and (iv) of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each person who is a non employee director on the first Monday in February in each year beginning on February 5, 2001 and continuing throughout the term of the Plan. The 1996 Plan was amended in 2003 to increase the automatic grants to (a) new non employee directors from 22,500 to 25,000 shares and (b) existing non employee directors from 11,250 to 15,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. No other options shall be granted under the terms of the 1996 Plan. Options granted under the 1996 Plan must be NQOs, shall be granted at 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to January 2002 expire five years following the date of grant and options granted thereafter expire seven years following the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to February 5, 2001 become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year and options granted on or after February 5, 2001 are immediately exercisable. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1996 Plan. Generally, if an optionee ceases to be a director of Teradyne other than by reason of death, no further installments of his or her options become exercisable and the options terminate after three months. However, under certain circumstances, unless a board member becomes a director of a competitor of Teradyne, if the board member goes into government service or retires from the Board of Directors, such option may be exercised within its original terms. The 1996 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2006. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. The purpose of SAB 104 is to rescind the accounting guidance given in SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, related to multiple element arrangements, which was superceded as a result of EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The guidance in EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. 40 The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 150 (SFAS 150), Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability. For all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, SFAS 150 is effective immediately. For all other instruments, SFAS 150 goes into effect at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In April 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 149 (SFAS 149), Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies accounting and reporting of derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 146 (SFAS 146), Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In February 2003, FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21 (EITF 00 21), Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 requires revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting. If the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria, arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. Applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting. The guidance in EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as amended by FIN 46R, which addresses consolidation by a business of variable interest entities in which it is the primary beneficiary. The Interpretation is effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and the first quarter of fiscal 2004 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Teradyne does not have any variable interest entities. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results From time to time, information provided by Teradyne, statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Form 10 K) contain statements that are not purely historical, but are forward looking statements, made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, forward looking statements made herein include projections, plans and objectives for Teradynes business, financial condition, operating results, future operations, or future economic performance, statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to 41 meet working capital requirements, capital expenditures, expectations as to customer orders and demand for Teradynes products and statements relating to backlog, bookings and cancellations, gross margins and pricing considerations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, which could cause Teradynes actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. These factors, and others, are discussed from time to time in Teradynes filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Teradynes Business Is Impacted by the Slowdown in Economies Worldwide. Teradynes business has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the global economies that began in the second half of 2000. The uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investments and may cause a further reduction of such investments. These reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and semiconductor industry which Teradyne serves and have contributed to Teradyne incurring losses. Teradyne cannot predict if or when the growth rate of worldwide economies will rebound, or whether the growth rate of its business will rebound when the worldwide economies begin to grow. Current Geopolitical Turmoil and the Continuing Threat of Domestic and International Terrorist Attacks May Adversely Impact Teradynes Revenues. International turmoil, exacerbated by the war in Iraq and tensions in North Korea have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate, both in the United States and globally, which may affect Teradynes ability to generate revenue on a predictable basis. In addition, terrorist attacks internationally and the threat of future terrorist attacks both domestically and internationally have negatively impacted an already weakened worldwide economy. As Teradyne sells and manufacturers products both in the United States and internationally, the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase Teradynes operating costs and which may adversely affect Teradynes business. These conditions make it difficult for Teradyne, and its customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. Teradynes Business is Dependent on the Current and Anticipated Market for Electronics. Teradynes business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. The current and anticipated market demand for electronics has been impacted by the economic slowdown that began in the latter portions of 2000 and the effects of the hostilities begun in September 2001. Historically, the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply, which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment, including systems manufactured and marketed by Teradyne. Teradyne believes that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that Teradyne manufactures and markets will also be subject to similar fluctuations. Teradyne is dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Teradyne cannot assure that any increase in revenues or new orders for a calendar year will be sustained in subsequent years. In addition, any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and operating results. Teradyne Has Taken Measures to Address the Past Slowdown in the Market for Its Products Which Could Have Long term Negative Effects on Teradynes Business. Teradyne has taken measures to address the slowdown in the market for its products. In particular, Teradyne has reduced its workforce, closed and or sold facilities, discontinued certain of its product lines, implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced its planned capital expenditures and expense budgets. These 42 measures have reduced expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders. However, each measure Teradyne has taken to contain expenditures could have long term negative effects on Teradynes business by reducing its pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in its products, increasing Teradynes debt, and making it more difficult for Teradyne to respond to customers or competitors, as the market and customer orders turn around. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Adequately Address a Rapid Increase in Customer Demand Because Teradyne took measures during the past three years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services, and because visibility into Teradynes market is limited, Teradyne may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand, as the market turns around. Teradynes ability to meet increases in customer demand is, to a certain extent, dependant upon the ability of its suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements, which Teradyne has little or no control over. Teradynes Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Acquisitions Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has acquired a number of businesses. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement its existing operations. Such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; the inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business; the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business; the possibility that Teradynes reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business; potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business, including but not limited to regulatory, environmental and tax liabilities; the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles, which may adversely affect Teradynes reported results of operations; and litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions. For example, in connection with the August 2000 acquisition of each of Herco Technology Corp., a California company, and Perception Laminates, Inc., a California company, a complaint was filed on or about September 5, 2001 and is now pending in Federal District Court, San Diego, California, by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants Teradyne and two of its executive officers. This case is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. Additionally, in 2001, Teradyne was designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a clean up site in Los Angeles, California. This claim arises out of Teradynes acquisition of Perception Laminates, Inc. in August 2000. Prior to that date, Perception Laminates had itself acquired certain assets of Alco Industries Inc. under an asset purchase agreement dated July 30, 1992. This case is further described in Part I, Environmental Affairs in this Form 10 K. In addition to the foregoing, any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to Teradynes expectations. 43 Teradyne Currently Faces, and in the Future May Be the Subject of, Securities Class Action Litigation Due to Past or Future Stock Price Volatility. Teradyne and two of its executive officers were named as defendants in three purported class action complaints that were filed in Federal District Court, Boston, Massachusetts, in October and November 2001. The court consolidated the cases and has appointed three lead plaintiffs. On November 8, 2002, plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended class action complaint. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by making, during the period from July 14, 2000 until October 17, 2000, material misrepresentations and omissions to the investing public regarding Teradynes business operations and future prospects. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including compensatory damages and recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Teradyne filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint on February 7, 2003. On April 9, 2003, the lead plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to Teradynes motion to dismiss. On May 28, 2003, Teradyne filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the complaint. Oral arguments in connection with Teradynes motion to dismiss were presented to the District Court on June 26, 2003. Claims asserted in this case are similar to the claims asserted in the case discussed above, which is pending in the Federal District Court in San Diego, California. On January 16, 2004, the U.S. Magistrate Judge recommended to the U.S. District Court that Teradynes motion to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint in its entirety be allowed without prejudice. On February 2, 2004, the lead plaintiffs filed an objection to the U.S. Magistrate Judges recommendation. Teradyne is currently preparing its response to the lead plaintiffs objection. Teradyne believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend itself vigorously. Management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on Teradynes financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on Teradynes financial position or results of operations. Teradynes Business May be Adversely Impacted by Divestitures of Lines of Business Which May Affect Its Ability to Manage and Maintain Its Business. Since Teradynes inception, it has divested itself of certain lines of business. In the future, Teradyne may undertake additional divestitures. Such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on Teradynes culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business; restructuring, inventory and other charges which may affect Teradynes results of operations; and the decreased diversification of Teradynes product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make Teradynes operating results subject to increased market fluctuations. If Teradyne Is Unable to Protect Its Intellectual Property, Teradyne May Lose a Valuable Asset or May Incur Costly Litigation to Protect Its Rights. Teradynes products incorporate technology that it protects in several ways, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets (IP). While Teradyne believes that its IP has value in the aggregate, no single element of its IP is in itself essential. If a significant portion of Teradynes IP is invalidated or ineffective, Teradynes business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, Teradyne receives notifications from time to time that it may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against Teradyne, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell its products, or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect its operating results. 44 If Teradyne Fails to Develop New Technologies to Adapt to Its Customers Needs and if Its Customers Fail to Accept Its New Products, Teradynes Revenues Will Be Adversely Affected. Teradyne believes that its technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of its engineers. Teradynes development of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to Teradynes success. Successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors, including: new product selection; development of competitive products by competitors; timely and efficient completion of product design; timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing; and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations. Teradyne Is Subject to Intense Competition. Teradyne faces significant competition throughout the world in each of its operating segments. Some of Teradynes competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Teradyne also faces competition from internal suppliers at several of its customers. Some of Teradynes competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those Teradyne currently offers. Teradyne expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of Teradynes products. Moreover, increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition, which could materially adversely affect Teradynes business, financial condition and results of operations. Teradyne Is Subject to Risks of Operating Internationally. Teradyne derives a significant portion of its total revenue from customers outside the United States. The table set out below summarizes total Teradyne revenue earned within the United States (US) and outside the US (Non US) for the last three fiscal years: For the year ended December 31: 2003 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) US $ 503.8 37 % $ 561.1 46 % $ 733.6 51 % Non US $ 849.1 63 % $ 661.1 54 % $ 707.0 49 % Teradynes international revenues and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including: unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; changes in tariffs and exchange rates; social, political and economic instability, acts of terrorism and international conflicts; difficulties in accounts receivable collection; cultural differences in the conduct of business; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; potentially adverse tax consequences; and compliance with customs regulations. 45 In addition, an increasing portion of Teradynes products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations, including China, and a large portion of the devices Teradynes products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in Taiwan, Singapore, China and other parts of Asia. As a result, Teradyne is subject to a number of economic and other risks, particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions. Disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact Teradynes ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business. Teradynes Business May Suffer if it is Unable to Attract and Retain Key Employees. Competition for employees with skills required by Teradyne is intense in the high technology industry. Teradynes success will depend on its ability to attract and retain key technical employees. The loss of one or more key or other employees, Teradynes inability to attract additional qualified employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations or financial condition. If Teradynes Suppliers do not Meet Teradynes Product or Delivery Requirements, Teradyne Could Have Reduced Revenues and Earnings. Certain components, including semiconductor chips, may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet Teradynes quality or delivery requirements. Approximately 30% of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive. If any of Teradynes suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments with Teradyne or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for Teradynes products, Teradyne could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Teradyne relies upon contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in its products, and Teradynes ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom Teradyne does not exercise any control. In addition, Teradyne is dependent on the financial strength of its suppliers. For example, on September 24, 2003, a supplier of Teradyne filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. While the loss of this supplier has not had a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that the loss of other Teradyne suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, results of operations or financial condition. Teradyne May Incur Significant Liabilities if It Fails to Comply With Environmental Regulations. Teradyne is subject to environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes. If Teradyne fails to comply with present and future regulations, or is required to perform site remediation, Teradyne could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also: restrict Teradynes ability to expand its facilities; require Teradyne to acquire costly equipment; or require Teradyne to incur other significant costs and expenses. Pursuant to present regulations and agreements, Teradyne is conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and is implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2003, Teradyne has not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire sites. 46 Teradyne Has Substantially Increased Its Indebtedness. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne completed a private placement of $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due 2006 and received net proceeds of $389 million. As a result, Teradyne has incurred approximately $400 million principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing its ratio of debt to total capitalization. The level of Teradynes indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for Teradyne to make payments on its debt and other obligations; make it difficult for Teradyne to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; limit Teradynes flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, its business and the industries in which Teradyne competes; place Teradyne at a competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and make Teradyne more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business. There can be no assurance that Teradyne will be able to meet its debt service obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Satisfy Certain Obligations in the Event of a Change in Control. The indenture governing the Notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of Teradyne. If a change in control occurs, the holders of the Notes have the right to require Teradyne to repurchase all of the Notes not previously called for redemption. The price that Teradyne is required to pay is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, together with interest accrued but unpaid to, but excluding, the repurchase date. At Teradynes option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, instead of paying the repurchase price in cash, it may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at 95% of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date. If Teradyne is required to repurchase the Notes, there is no guarantee that it will have enough funds to pay such amounts. As a result, a change of control of Teradyne could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. Teradyne May Not Be Able to Pay Its Debt and Other Obligations. If Teradynes cash flow is inadequate to meet its obligations, Teradyne could face substantial liquidity problems. If Teradyne sustains continued losses or is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes or certain of its other obligations, Teradyne would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness Teradyne may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, Teradyne cannot assure that it would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the Notes payment if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations. Moreover, Teradyne cannot assure that it will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes at maturity. 47 Teradyne May Need Additional Financing, Which Could Be Difficult to Obtain. Teradyne expects that its existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet Teradynes cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. However, Teradyne has a finite amount of cash and in the event Teradyne may need to raise additional funds, due to on going losses or other reasons, Teradyne cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, particularly in light of Teradynes continued quarterly losses. Further, if Teradyne issues additional equity securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Future financings may place restrictions on how Teradyne operates its business. If Teradyne cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, Teradyne may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow its business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm Teradynes business. If Teradyne is Required to Account for Options Under Its Employee Stock Plans as a Compensation Expense, Teradynes Compensation Expense Would Be Increased. There has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options. Teradyne currently discloses pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net loss and net loss per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements. If future laws and regulations require Teradyne to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations, its reported operating results will be adversely affected. Note B: Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on Teradynes net loss and net loss per share if it had been in effect during the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are additional stock based compensation disclosures. Provisions of Teradynes Charter and By Laws and Massachusetts Law Make a Takeover of Teradyne More Difficult. Teradynes basic corporate documents, its stockholder rights plan and Massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of Teradyne, even if a change of control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of Teradynes stockholders. Teradynes Operating Results Are Likely to Fluctuate Significantly. Teradynes annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability. With respect to the operating results for the year ending December 31, 2003, the following factors materially and adversely affected revenues and profitability: competitive pressures on selling prices; provisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products; and impairment charges for certain long lived assets; The above factors, in conjunction with the additional factors set out below are expected to impact future operations: Teradynes ability to introduce and the market acceptance of new products planned for 2004 and beyond; changes in product revenue mix resulting from changes in customer demand; the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter resulting from the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and 48 constraints occurring at the end of a quarter, or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business; engineering and development investments relating to the new product introductions in 2004, new product introductions planned for 2005 and the expansion of manufacturing and engineering operations in Asia; and ability of Teradynes suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for Teradyne products, especially if product demand increases rapidly. In particular, due to Teradynes introduction of a number of new, complex test systems in 2003 and the planned introduction of other systems in 2004, there can be no assurance that Teradyne will not experience delays in shipment of its products or that its products will achieve customer acceptance. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, Teradyne has and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Teradynes Investor Confidence and Share Value May Be Adversely Impacted if Teradynes independent auditors are unable to provide Teradyne with the attestation of the adequacy of Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Securities and Exchange Commission, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10 K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, Teradynes independent auditors must attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting. This requirement will first apply to Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004. Although Teradyne intends to diligently and vigorously review its internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, if Teradynes independent auditors are not satisfied with Teradynes internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules and or regulations differently from Teradyne, then they may decline to attest to managements assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of Teradynes financial statements, which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of Teradynes shares. 49 Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in European and Japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position. Forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy U.S. dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was $5.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively. A 10% fluctuation in exchange rates for 2003 and 2002 currencies would change the fair value by approximately $0.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively. However, since these contracts hedge non U.S. currency assets and liabilities, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of these assets and liabilities being hedged. The hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk Management Teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. Debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Since the Notes were out of the money at year end, they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored. On this basis, the potential loss on the fair value of debt was not material at December 31, 2003, and was $9.4 million at December 31, 2002. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On this basis, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $2.3 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 50
