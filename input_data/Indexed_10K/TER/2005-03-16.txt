SAB 101 summarizes certain of the Staffs views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Teradyne implemented the SECs SAB 101 guidelines, retroactive to the beginning of the year. This was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2000. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years resulted in a charge to income of $64.1 million (net of income taxes of $27.5 million) or $0.35 per diluted share which has been included in income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, Teradyne recognized $126.1 million in revenue that is included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000. Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of Teradynes plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Teradynes actual results could differ 15 materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to Teradynes customers upon shipment. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, Teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur. For equipment that includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product, revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require Teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, Teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of Teradyne. Teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Teradynes post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. Teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and Teradyne defers revenue in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 90 1. Teradynes products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. Teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. 16 Connection Systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements. Teradyne does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position No. 97 2 (SOP 97 2), Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans Teradyne accounts for its director and employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Teradynes employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan. Teradynes stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. Accordingly, there have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid in capital. Teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. See Note B: Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). In interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, SFAS 123R would eliminate the ability to 17 account for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value based method under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to calculate equity based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. Under SFAS 123R, equity based compensation is required to be recognized in companies financial statements. Teradyne expects to adopt SFAS 123R in the third quarter of 2005, as required. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, had SFAS 123R been effective, Teradyne would have recognized additional non cash equity based compensation expense of $91.8 million, $85.1 million, and $110.3 million, respectively, applying the provisions of SFAS 123. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at December 31, 2003 and 2004. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence, including sustained profitability, exists that realization is more likely than not. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets Teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors Teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of Teradynes use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When Teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, Teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. Teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The volatility of the industries that Teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows, which can impact their ability to make required payments. Teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customers current payment history, the customers current financial statements and other information regarding the customers credit worthiness. If the financial condition of Teradynes customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. 18 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Percentage of net revenue: Net Revenue: Products 86.8 % 82.5 % 81.2 % Service 13.2 17.5 18.8 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of Revenues: Cost of products 50.4 59.0 67.9 Cost of service 9.2 11.5 13.1 Total cost of revenue 59.6 70.5 81.0 Gross Profit 40.4 29.5 19.0 Operating Expenses: Engineering and development 14.6 18.8 24.0 Selling and administrative 15.0 18.4 23.8 Restructuring and other charges 0.3 5.3 10.2 Goodwill impairment 6.5 Gain on the sale of a business 29.9 42.5 64.5 Net interest and other (expense) income (0.7 ) (0.4 ) Income (loss) before income taxes 10.5 (13.7 ) (45.9 ) Provision for income taxes 1.3 0.6 12.9 Net income (loss) 9.2 % (14.3 )% (58.8 )% Results of Operations: Bookings Teradynes net orders for its four reportable segments for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PercentChange 2002 2003PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 1,036.4 $ 837.9 $ 480.5 24 % 74 % Connection Systems 384.8 317.7 149.8 21 112 Assembly Test Systems 162.1 156.6 167.8 4 (7 ) Other Test Systems 107.6 105.9 107.2 2 (1 ) $ 1,690.9 $ 1,418.1 $ 905.3 19 % 57 % From 2003 to 2004, Semiconductor Test Systems bookings increased due to growth in the overall system on a chip (SOC) tester market (excluding memory testers). Semiconductor Test Systems bookings within the SOC market showed a continuation of the growth in Asian markets from 2003 into 2004, mainly related to Subcons in Taiwan and Singapore. Over 2004, Teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs in the wireless, broadband, consumer electronics, and mass storage/datacom markets, which are serviced by the J750, Catalyst and FLEX products, and whose chips are sold mainly by European and U.S. semiconductor companies. Many of these chips are fabricated and tested by Foundries and 19 Subcons in many parts of Asia, but concentrated in Taiwan and Singapore. The economic downturn which prevailed in past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs. As a result, an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource non core competency testing needs to Subcons in low cost regions. As total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings have grown, the bookings from Subcons have continued to make up a large percentage of total orders. Bookings from Subcons increased 45% to $443 million in 2004 from $307 million in 2003, and made up 43% of bookings in 2004 compared to 37% in 2003. Semiconductor Test Systems backlog increased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to increased orders from Subcons and Foundries located in the Asian markets. The growth in Connection Systems orders from 2003 to 2004 was a result of continued spending for wireless network deployments in the United States and Europe as well as an increase in network spending for both the enterprise and service provider markets. The computer/server market was also strong. Bookings were up appreciably for Connection Systems VHDM HSD backplane interconnect product lines as well as the NeXLev family of high speed, high density mezzanine connectors. Similar to 2003, the growth in orders was partially offset by a decline in orders due to the decision to exit a portion of Connection Systems lower margin EMS product line. The increase in Connection Systems bookings from 2002 to 2003 was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in 2003, as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market, driven by wireless network deployments, which increased for both U.S. and European telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003. Orders in the Assembly Test Systems segment increased from 2003 to 2004, primarily driven by increases in the mil/aero business and increased sales of in circuit products. The growth in these areas was offset by a decline in orders resulting from the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines in 2003. The net decrease in Assembly Test Systems orders from 2002 to 2003 is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines. This decrease was offset by a 25% increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the Mil/Aero business, which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of 2003. Teradynes cancellations for its four reportable segments for the last three years are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 10.5 $ 6.9 $ 52.5 Connection Systems 16.0 104.3 Assembly Test Systems 0.2 2.5 2.2 Other Test Systems $ 10.7 $ 25.4 $ 159.0 Semiconductor Test Systems experienced $10.5 million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in 2004. Approximately 50% of this amount was related to cancellations, while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to managements estimate of what may be canceled in future periods. The Connection Systems cancellations in 2003 were from major customers in the telecommunications and networking infrastructure industries, due principally to product program cancellations. 20 Teradynes net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 United States 32 % 35 % 44 % South East Asia 19 18 13 Europe 17 17 18 Taiwan 15 10 6 Singapore 11 11 8 Japan 5 8 9 Rest of the World 1 1 2 100 % 100 % 100 % For the past three years, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its four reportable segments is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 224.1 $ 333.7 $ 240.0 Connection Systems 80.5 75.6 104.2 Assembly Test Systems 63.8 56.1 53.4 Other Test Systems 38.8 40.7 43.3 $ 407.2 $ 506.1 $ 440.9 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2004, 2003, and 2002 there were no significant cancellation penalties received. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, Teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, financial condition, and results of operations. Revenue Teradynes net revenue for its four reportable segments for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PercentChange 2002 2003PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 1,146.3 $ 735.4 $ 557.5 56 % 32 % Connection Systems 381.7 357.2 397.0 7 (10 ) Assembly Test Systems 155.2 151.6 170.8 2 (11 ) Other Test Systems 108.7 108.7 96.9 12 $ 1,791.9 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 32 % 11 % The increase in Semiconductor Test Systems sales from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to growth in the overall SOC test market, and a share gain by Semiconductor Test Systems in that market. The worldwide market for semiconductor test equipment (excluding memory testers) grew by approximately 34% in 2004. Semiconductor Test Systems share in that market grew from 2003 to 2004. Much of the increased sales for Semiconductor Test Systems came from Subcon customers for use in their Asian facilities, primarily in Singapore and Taiwan. The revenue derived from Subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal SOC customers, led by sales of Catalyst and FLEX systems. As is described in the Bookings section, Semiconductor Test Systems has seen growth in revenue from 2003 to 2004 due to increased need for testing in the wireless, broadband, and to a lesser extent, mass storage/datacom sectors. Sales of the J750 product were also relatively strong in 2004, serving the microcontroller and high volume logic customer segments. Similar to the increase in sales from 2003 to 2004, the increase from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to increased demand from Subcons located in the Asian markets, particularly, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia. 21 Connection Systems sales in 2004 increased to $381.7 million led by stronger customer demand for Connection Systems high speed, high density interconnect products, which more than offset the decrease in sales associated with the exiting of the lower margin EMS business in 2003. Connection Systems sales declined from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin EMS business. The segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years. The increase in Assembly Test Systems sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to increases in both the commercial and mil/aero businesses. Commercial business growth was due to increased sales of in circuit test products, while the increase in mil/aero sales was generated by a number of large projects which were undertaken in 2004. These increases were offset, in part, by decreases from the sale of the manual x ray, rework and AOI product lines in 2003. From 2002 through 2003, the commercial business saw decreases in revenue, particularly due to the sale of product lines referenced above, while mil/aero revenue increased slightly year over year . Teradynes four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2004 2003 2002 Semiconductor Test Systems 64 % 55 % 46 % Connection Systems 21 26 32 Assembly Test Systems 9 11 14 Other Test Systems 6 8 8 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 United States 30 % 37 % 46 % Europe 15 17 18 South East Asia 20 17 11 Singapore 13 11 8 Taiwan 15 9 9 Japan 5 8 6 Rest of the World 2 1 2 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PercentChange 2002 2003PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Product Revenue $ 1,554.8 $ 1,115.9 $ 992.1 39 % 12 % Service Revenue 237.1 237.0 230.1 3 $ 1,791.9 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 32 % 11 % Service revenue is derived from the servicing of Teradynes installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, Teradynes three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 18%, 21% and 23% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. 22 Gross Margin 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PointChange 2002 2003PointChange (dollars in millions) Gross Margin $ 723.9 $ 398.9 $ 232.7 Percent of Total Revenue 40.4 % 29.5 % 19.0 % 10.9 10.5 The gross margin improvement from 2003 to 2004 was the result of several factors. An improvement of 9 points is credited to an increase in sales volumes and a shift in the mix of revenues, with higher Semiconductor Test Systems content which has higher incremental margins. The remainder is attributable to lower material costs and a reduction in fixed manufacturing costs, including depreciation and facility costs resulting from past restructuring actions. Teradynes gross margin improvement from 2002 to 2003 was impacted by a variety of factors, including an improvement of 4.9 points related to reduced manufacturing costs and increased volume levels, and an improvement of 2.5 points related to an increase in volume and a shift in product mix. Inventory provisions decreased from $39.0 million in 2002 to $16.6 million in 2003, which contributed a 2.0 point gross margin improvement. The breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PointChange 2002 2003PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Margin $ 651.4 $ 317.1 $ 163.0 Percent of Product Revenue 41.9 % 28.4 % 16.4 % 13.5 12.0 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PointChange 2002 2003PointChange (dollars in millions) Service Gross Margin $ 72.5 $ 81.8 $ 69.7 Percent of Service Revenue 30.6 % 34.5 % 30.3 % (3.9 ) 4.2 Teradyne assesses the carrying value of its inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed, is written down to estimated net realizable value. These write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components. Sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision which is recorded in cost of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2004, Teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of $3.5 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Of the $11.3 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $6.2 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems, $3.0 million related to Assembly Test Systems, $1.6 million related to Connection Systems and $0.5 million related to Other Test Systems. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of $7.4 million and $9.2 million, respectively. Of the $16.6 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $9.3 million related to Assembly Test Systems which included $3.6 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing, distributing and primary support of the AOI product line and $5.2 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems SOC parts and components. 23 During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of $28.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Of the $39.0 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $27.9 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems, including $20.7 million of memory test inventory related to Probe One and J996 product line discontinuances. The Probe One and J996 inventory had been fully written off as of December 31, 2003. There is no material exposure remaining for the Probe One or J996 products. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Teradyne sold inventory that was previously reserved for which had a gross margin impact of $2.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Teradyne scrapped $44.8 million, $30.3 million, and $22.8 million of inventory which had been previously written down or written off during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Teradyne had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of $153.9 million and $191.1 million, respectively. Of the reserves at December 31, 2004, $10.5 million, $12.6 million, $3.6 million, and $127.2 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2004, 2003, 2002, and prior to 2002, respectively. Of the reserves at December 31, 2003, $16.6 million, $20.2 million, and $154.3 million related to inventory provisions recorded in 2003, 2002 and prior to 2002, respectively.

More than two thirds of Teradynes total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between $150 $250 million. During 2002 and 2003, Semiconductor Test Systems reduced the number of platforms under major development, which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms. The consolidation of multiple product divisions within Semiconductor Test Systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation. The increase of $7 million in engineering and development spending from 2003 to 2004 consists of the following amounts: $7 million increase due to variable employee compensation; $6 million increase in prototype material for engineering development projects; $4 million increase in outsourced project engineering; and $1 million increase in travel and training costs; These increases were offset in part by the following: $6 million decrease in salaries and fringe benefits due to a decrease in headcount, offset by salary increases effective July 1, 2004; and 24 $5 million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending, including a decrease of $2 million in accelerated depreciation related to asset writedowns and facility closures in 2003. The reduction in engineering and development expenses from 2002 to 2003 resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within Semiconductor Test Systems and Assembly Test Systems. The elimination of memory test within the Semiconductor Test Systems segment resulted in a reduction of $5 million in engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003. In addition, Semiconductor Test Systems consolidated engineering facilities, outsourced certain software engineering development to a low cost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce costs. As a result of the sale in Assembly Test Systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products, engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003 decreased by approximately $15 million. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts: $16 million as a result of a workforce reduction, partially offset by a $10 million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases in the third quarter of 2002; $13 million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering; $4 million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the recent writedown of assets, as well as the trend to rent or lease, rather than purchase, development tools; and $3 million from reduced office and facility costs.

The decrease in spending from 2002 to 2003 was principally due to the following approximate amounts: $18 million as a result of a workforce reduction, partially offset by a $3 million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases; $12 million in reduced utility costs from the consolidation of facilities, lower promotional spending and travel cutbacks; $7 million from a decrease in consulting spending and legal fees; and $4 million in lower depreciation due to the writedown of assets. 25 Restructuring and Other Charges The tables below represent activity related to restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. Teradyne expects to pay out approximately $7.0 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Teradynes future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $13 million as of December 31, 2004. Teradyne has subleased approximately 52% of its unoccupied space as of December 31, 2004 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space. The table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended December 31, 2004 relating to restructuring and other charges (in thousands): Long LivedAssetImpairment SeveranceandBenefits FacilityRelated OtherCharges Total Balance at December 31, 2003 $ $ 7,766 $ 29,222 $ 1,273 $ 38,261 2004 provision (reversal) 810 2,864 3,188 (1,503 ) 5,359 Cash payments (7,570 ) (11,182 ) 1,259 (17,493 ) Asset write downs (810 ) (810 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ $ 3,060 $ 21,228 $ 1,029 $ 25,317 During the year ended December 31, 2004, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges: $1.4 million reversal due to revised estimates related to long lived asset impairment charges that had previously been recorded where the impaired assets sold for more than their respective carrying amounts, and $2.2 million of charges for certain long lived assets that were impaired as the estimated value of such assets was less than the carrying amount. The Assembly Test Systems segment recorded $1.1 million of this charge and $0.9 million was recorded in the Connection Systems segment. The remainder of the charge was recorded across other reportable segments. $5.0 million charge taken for severance and related benefits. This charge is offset by a $2.1 million reversal of estimates on future benefits for severed employees. There were approximately 184 employees terminated in the year ended December 31, 2004 across Teradyne. $3.2 million charge for revised estimates of losses due to changes in the assumed amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. The Connection Systems, Assembly Test and Semiconductor Test segments recorded $2.0 million, $1.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively. $1.5 million net reversal of other charges consisting of $1.4 million of amounts realized under agreements related to product lines that were sold, and $0.1 million of revisions of estimates of liabilities incurred during restructuring activities, both of which occurred in prior reporting periods in the Assembly Test and Other Test Systems segments. The restructuring actions taken in 2004 are expected to generate cost savings of approximately $13.8 million million annually across all areas of operations. During 2004, Teradyne recorded a gain on the sale of a business of $0.9 million. This amount related to an earn out provision from a divestiture in the Connection Systems segment in 1999, and has been classified as a gain on the sale of business in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. 26 The table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended December 31, 2003 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment SeveranceandBenefits Loss onSale ofProductLines FacilityRelated OtherCharges Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 8,242 $ $ 25,240 $ $ 33,482 2003 provision 29,403 21,367 6,891 12,350 1,273 71,284 Cash payments (21,843 ) (8,368 ) (30,211 ) Asset writedowns (29,403 ) (6,891 ) (36,294 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ $ 7,766 $ $ 29,222 $ 1,273 $ 38,261 During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges: $29.4 million charge, primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets, including $11.2 million for the sale and leaseback of certain manufacturing assets, and $7.8 million for a reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale in the Connection Systems segment. The charge for the Semiconductor Test Systems segment of $3.5 million related primarily to a reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale, and $6.9 million related to the impairment of manufacturing assets held for sale in the Assembly Test Systems segment. $21.4 million charge for severance and related benefits. There were approximately 890 employees terminated in 2003 across Teradyne. $8.1 million charge for the loss on sale of product lines, of which $6.9 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges and $1.2 million has been recorded in cost of sales. The product lines sold were in the Assembly Test Systems segment and the Other Systems segment. In the first quarter of 2003, the Assembly Test Systems segment sold its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line for total cash proceeds of $2.1 million. These transactions resulted in a loss of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 of which $6.2 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges, and $0.5 million has been recorded in cost of sales. In the year ended December 31, 2003, the Other Test Systems Segment recorded a charge of $1.4 million to write down its net assets relating to the sale of the Autodiagnosis automotive after market product line of which $0.7 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges and $0.7 million has been recorded in cost of sales. $12.4 million charge consisting primarily of revised estimates of losses due to changes in the assumed amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. The Connection Systems segment recorded $3.2 million of this charge and $8.7 million was recorded in the Assembly Test Systems segment. The remainder of the charge was recorded across other operating segments. $1.3 million charge primarily for contractual penalties associated with resizing the Connections Systems segment. The restructuring actions taken in 2003 were expected to generate cost savings of approximately $86.3 million annually across all areas of operations. 27 The table below summarizes activity for the year ended December 31, 2002 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment FacilityRelated SeveranceandBenefits Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ $ 1,676 8,471 $ 10,147 2002 provision 76,994 25,751 22,495 125,240 Cash payments (2,187 ) (22,724 ) (24,911 ) Asset writedowns (76,994 ) (76,994 ) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 25,240 $ 8,242 $ 33,482 During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges: $77.0 million charge primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets. The charges included machinery and equipment, facilities held for sale and intangible assets. All of the machinery and equipment and facilities have been sold or disposed of as of December 31, 2004. $25.8 million charge related to future lease commitments for vacated manufacturing and administrative space which have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. $22.5 million charge for severance and related benefits. There were approximately 1,010 employees terminated across Teradyne during the year ended December 31, 2002. For further details on Teradynes restructuring and other charges during 2004, 2003 and 2002 see Note L: Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2005, Teradyne committed to a restructuring plan (the Plan) as part of an ongoing effort to lower expenses. Pursuant to the Plan, Teradyne believes that it will incur costs for severance and related employee benefits, impairment charges and remaining lease obligations related to a vacated facility, and other charges. The total charges expected to be incurred under the Plan are $11.0 million. The actions taken in accordance with the Plan are expected to generate cost savings of approximately $18.4 million annually, primarily in the Connection Systems and Assembly Test segments. Through March 11, 2005, Teradyne has incurred charges of approximately $8.2 million, related to severance and related employee benefits, remaining lease obligations and related asset impairments, and other charges. Goodwill Impairment Unless conditions dictate otherwise, Teradynes annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Teradyne tested the Assembly Test Systems and Connection Systems reporting units, for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. During the quarter ended September 28, 2003, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for the fiscal years 2004 through 2006 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 112 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 28, 2003. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. 28 During the quarter ended September 29, 2002, as a result of contraction in the Assembly Test Systems market to its lowest level in a decade as evidenced by various market reports available to Teradyne, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 94 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 29, 2002. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment exceeded its fair value and recognized a $78.5 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment to its carrying value. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. Interest Income and Expense 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004Change 2002 2003Change (in millions) Interest income $ 15.4 $ 14.0 $ 17.0 $ 1.4 $ (3.0 ) Interest expense $ (18.8 ) $ (20.9 ) $ (21.8 ) $ 2.1 $ 0.9 The increase in interest income from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to an increase in interest rates in the latter half of 2004 and increased cash balances throughout 2004. The decrease in interest income from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. The decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 and from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of Teradynes California mortgage of $42.3 million in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003 and all of 2004, as well as the repurchase of $8.5 million of Teradynes 3.75% Convertible Notes in the third quarter of 2004. Other Income and Expense, Net Other income and expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 includes the following: Income/(expense) 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Gain on sale of investment (1) $ 2,584 $ 2,800 $ Collection of loan (2) 585 7,144 Other than temporary impairment of common stock investment (267 ) (3,115 ) Fair value adjustment on warrants (366 ) 138 (2,051 ) Mortgage prepayment penalty (3) (3,220 ) Other than temporary impairment of investment (2,592 ) Writedown of investment in an engineering service provider (2,288 ) Total $ 2,536 $ (2,874 ) $ (310 ) (1) Gain on sale of an investment in common stock. (2) The loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection. (3) Penalties related to prepayment of a $42.3 million mortgage loan collateralized against certain California real estate properties, which was to mature on January 1, 2007. 29 Income (loss) before Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004Change 2002 2003Change (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 199.4 $ (60.1 ) $ (266.1 ) $ 259.5 $ 206.0 Connection Systems 25.2 (36.0 ) (79.6 ) 61.2 43.6 Assembly Test Systems (72.8 ) (200.4 ) 72.8 127.6 Other Test Systems 6.8 2.5 1.2 4.3 1.3 Corporate (43.5 ) (19.8 ) (16.0 ) (23.7 ) (3.8 ) Total $ 187.9 $ (186.2 ) $ (560.9 ) $ 374.1 $ 374.7 The change to an income position from a loss position from 2003 to 2004 was mainly attributable to increased sales in the Semiconductor, Connector and Assembly Test Systems segments, as well as continued cost reductions throughout the company. The decrease in the loss before income taxes from 2002 to 2003 in Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems, and Assembly Test Systems was primarily due to cost reduction actions in the respective segments and market conditions during the year. Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased primarily due to increased revenues from 2002 to 2003. Income Taxes For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes. Tax expense for 2004 also included an IRS settlement related to the closing out of tax years 1999 through 2001. During 2004, Teradyne utilized previously reserved net operating losses to reduce taxable income and lower the effective tax rate. Teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003. Until sufficient positive evidence exists, including an appropriate level of profitability, Teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence, including sustained profitability, exists that realization is more likely than not. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were 12.1% and 4.2%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision of $157.5 million resulting in a tax rate of 28%. The tax rate of 28% is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. The evidence that Teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2002 included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year 2002 compared to earlier Teradyne forecasts, the inability to get to break even during 2002 despite implementing several restructuring programs, and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year 2003. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized. 30 Contractual Obligations The following table reflects Teradynes contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: PurchaseObligations Non cancelableLeaseCommitments* InterestonDebt** ConvertibleSenior Notes PensionFunding NotesPayable OtherDebt Total (in thousands) 2005 $ 146,518 $ 27,681 $ 14,877 $ $ 30,000 $ 4,826 $ 321 $ 224,223 2006 16,862 14,871 391,500 321 423,554 2007 14,235 184 321 14,740 2008 6,527 179 321 7,027 2009 5,759 173 321 6,253 Beyond 2009 12,817 525 6,148 19,490 Total $ 146,518 $ 83,881 $ 30,809 $ 391,500 $ 30,000 $ 4,826 $ 7,753 $ 695,287 * Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income of $9.6 million due in the future under non cancelable subleases. ** Includes interest on convertible notes. Pension funding requirements are not known beyond 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $105.2 million in 2004 from 2003, to $691.2 million. Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $44.9 million in 2003 from 2002, to $586.0 million and increased $45.1 million in 2002 from 2001, to $541.1 million. Cash activity for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004Change 2002 2003Change Cash provided by (used for) operating activities: Cash provided by (used for) net income (loss), adjusted for non cash items: $ 299.7 $ 15.3 $ (207.4 ) $ 284.4 $ 222.7 Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired (44.9 ) 18.9 203.1 (63.8 ) (184.2 ) Total cash provided by (used for) operating activities 254.8 34.2 (4.3 ) 220.6 38.5 Cash used for investing activities (292.9 ) (114.4 ) (102.2 ) (178.5 ) (12.2 ) Cash provided by financing activities 18.8 57.1 40.4 (38.3 ) 16.7 Total $ (19.3 ) $ (23.1 ) $ (66.1 ) $ 3.8 $ 43.0 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired used cash of $44.9 million in 2004 as inventory balances increased $16.0 million across each of Teradynes segments, although primarily in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, and accounts payable, deferred revenue and accruals decreased by $42.3 million, which includes a contribution to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan of approximately $35.6 million. The inventory, accounts payable, deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by a decrease of $6.0 million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an decrease in days sales outstanding, based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues, from 59 days in 2003 to 54 days in 2004. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $18.9 million in 2003 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of $56.3 million across all segments. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $203.1 million in 2002 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund in March of 2002. 31 Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, proceeds from asset disposals, proceeds from the sale of product lines, cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures increased by $84.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Additions of internally constructed systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment accounted for approximately $69.2 million of the increase in capital expenditures due to the recent introduction of the FLEX platform. The remainder of the increase was attributable to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across Teradyne to support the increase in revenues in 2004 and continued investment in research and development. Capital expenditures were $165.2 million in 2004, $81.2 million in 2003, and $76.4 million in 2002. Financing activities include sales of Teradynes common stock, as well as repayments of debt. During 2004 and 2003, repayments of long term debt used cash of $11.5 million and $43.4 million, respectively as Teradyne repurchased a portion of its outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2004, and prepaid its mortgage on its California properties in the third quarter of 2003. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $30.3 million, $100.5 million, and $41.2 million, respectively. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne issued $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 (the Notes) in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Teradyne began making annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Teradyne that rank equally with Teradynes existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In the event of a change in control by which Teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, the holders of the Notes may be able to require Teradyne to redeem some or all of the Notes either in discounted Teradyne common stock or in cash. On February 8, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a Registration Statement on Form S 3 covering both the Notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted. On or after October 18, 2004, Teradyne may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below. The redemption price, expressed as a percentage of principal amount, is as follows for the designated periods: Period RedemptionPrice Beginning on October 18, 2004 and ending on October 14, 2005 101.50 % Beginning on October 15, 2005 and ending on October 14, 2006 100.75 % and thereafter equal to 100% of the principal amount. The Board of Directors of Teradyne has authorized management to repurchase up to $100 million of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 101.50. In the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, Teradyne repurchased $8.5 million and $20.0 million of the Notes, respectively. The decision to repurchase a portion of the Notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the redemption price during the period. Currently, management intends to repurchase the Notes on the open market through negotiated transactions when management believes that such price is beneficial to Teradyne. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing of when and the amount of the Notes that management may elect to repurchase, including the price of the available Notes, Teradynes stock price, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities, prevailing interest rates, and Teradynes anticipated liquidity needs. 32 If, at some point in the future, Teradynes stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, management may elect to convert a portion of the Notes into equity, to avoid the continuation of interest payments and to conserve capital. However, there can be no assurance that even if Teradynes stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the Notes will convert into equity as Teradynes stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date. If this were to occur, Teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the Notes called into cash. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including Teradynes stock price, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities and Teradynes anticipated liquidity needs. Teradyne believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $691.2 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $30.0 million in 2005 to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan which is currently under funded. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans Teradynes pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit plan, was approximately $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which was 0.73% of Teradynes cost of revenue and operating expenses. The largest portion of Teradynes 2004 pension expense was $5.7 million for its U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected return on plan assets for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets of 8%. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, Teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Teradyne also considered its historical 15 year compounded return of 8.41% for the period ending December 31, 2003, which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Based on these historical returns, Teradyne believes that 8% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2004. Teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust these returns as necessary. The current asset allocation for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 48.1% invested in equity securities and 51.9% invested in fixed income securities, which is in accordance with the plans asset allocation requirements. Teradynes actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2004 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model. Teradynes investment manager regularly reviews Teradynes actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with Teradynes targeted allocations. Teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2004 in the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan Teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately $6.2 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that Teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index (formerly Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index), which was at 5.68% at December 31, 2004, down from 6.00% at December 31, 2003. As a result, Teradyne selected 5.75% for its December 31, 2004 discount rate, which was down from 6% as of December 31, 2003. Each year Teradyne considers the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, along with other indices including the Moodys AA rated corporate bond yield and the Citigroup 10+ Year AAA/AA rate. Teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan will be approximately $5.7 million, $5.1 million and $4.7 million in fiscal 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. The pension expense estimates are based on a 5.75% discount rate. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in Teradynes pension plans. 33 Teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2004, if Teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 5% 6% 7% (in millions) 7% $ 10.8 $ 7.3 $ 4.0 8% 9.3 5.7 2.4 9% 7.7 4.2 0.9 Teradynes funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $121.6 million at December 31, 2003 to $165.9 million at December 31, 2004. The investment performance returns and Teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $70.9 million at December 31, 2003 to $37.9 million at December 31, 2004. During 2004, Teradyne contributed $35.6 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $30.0 million in 2005 to this plan. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to Teradynes 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note P: Stock Based Compensation, Teradyne maintains three equity compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance to Teradynes employees, directors and or consultants: 1) 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan; 2) 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan; and 3) 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan. The purpose of these plans is to promote the interests of Teradyne by attracting and retaining the services of qualified and talented persons to serve as employees, directors and or consultants of Teradyne. Except for the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of the foregoing plans was approved by Teradynes shareholders. The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2004: Plan category Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights Weighted average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under stock option compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column(1)) (shares in thousands) Stock option plans approved by shareholders 5,427 $ 22.73 2,856 Stock option plans not approved by shareholders(1) 25,329 22.23 16,777 Total 30,756 $ 22.31 19,633 34 (1) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), Teradyne assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of Teradyne common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock for each share of GenRad common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2004, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 260 shares of Teradyne common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $71.09 per share. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan) Under the 1991 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options which qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (ISOs) and non qualified stock options (NQOs), up to a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. ISOs may be granted only to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries and NQOs may be granted to employees, consultants and directors who are also employees of Teradyne. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 200,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted options to purchase, in the aggregate, more than 300,000 shares of common stock under the 1991 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1991 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an option whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the option, its exercise price and other pertinent terms, including vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each option may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees option may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1991 Plan is a shareholder approved fixed accounting plan which expires in 2011. The 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) Under the 1997 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue ISOs to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries, and NQOs, stock awards and authorizations to purchase Teradyne common stock to employees, consultants or directors (provided that no options may be granted to non employee directors) up to a maximum of 53,000,000 shares. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 400,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted an option to acquire more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1997 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an award, the pertinent terms of such award, including, if such award is an option, whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the award, its exercise price and vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each award may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees award may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1997 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2007. Options granted prior to September 2001 under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of five years. Beginning in September 2001, options granted under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of seven years. In addition, Teradyne made a one time grant to all employees under the 1991 and 1997 Plans that vests over two years and has a term of seven years. 35 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 1996 Plan) Each non employee director of Teradyne is entitled to participate in the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options to purchase up to a maximum of 1,600,000 shares of common stock. The 1996 Plan currently provides for the automatic grant (i) on the date of election, of an option to purchase 25,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each non employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors on or after January 1, 2004 (Initial Grant), (ii) on the first Monday in February in each year, beginning in 2004 and continuing throughout the Plan, of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each existing non employee Director (Annual Grant); and (iii) on the first Monday in February in each year, beginning in 2005 and continuing throughout the Plan, of an option to purchase 30,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to the non employee Chairman of the Board of Directors (Chair) in lieu of the Annual Grant (Annual Chair Grant). The 1996 Plan was amended on January 24, 2005 to increase the automatic grant to a non employee Chair from 15,000 to 30,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. Options granted under the 1996 Plan must be NQOs, shall be granted at 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to January 2002 expire five years following the date of grant and options granted thereafter expire seven years following the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to February 5, 2001 become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year and options granted on or after February 5, 2001 are immediately exercisable. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1996 Plan. Generally, if an optionee ceases to be a director of Teradyne other than by reason of death, no further installments of his or her options become exercisable and the options terminate after three months. However, under certain circumstances, unless a board member becomes a director of a competitor of Teradyne, if the board member goes into government service or retires from the Board of Directors, such option may be exercised within its original terms. The 1996 Plan is a shareholder approved fixed accounting plan which expires in 2006. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments (EITF 03 1), but, in September 2004, delayed the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03 1. For reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, only the disclosure requirements for available for sale securities and cost method investments are required. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). In interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, SFAS 123R would eliminate the ability to account for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value based method under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to calculate equity based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. Under SFAS 123R, public companies are allowed to select from three alternative transition methods: the Modified Prospective Application, which allows for the adoption of SFAS 123R without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption; the Modified Prospective Application with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption; and the Modified Retrospective Application which allows companies to restate prior financial statements. Teradyne expects to adopt SFAS 123R beginning in the third quarter of 2005, as required, using the Modified Prospective method, and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of SFAS 123R . Currently, Teradyne discloses pro forma net income (loss) and related pro forma net income (loss) per share in accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148. Under SFAS 123R, equity based compensation expense is required to be recognized in companies financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, had SFAS 123R been effective, Teradyne would have recognized additional non cash equity based compensation expense of $91.8 million, $85.1 million, and $110.3 million, respectively, applying the provisions of SFAS 123. Teradyne is considering accelerating the vesting of certain outstanding unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under Teradynes various stock option plans. In addition, Teradyne is considering the use of other equity compensation vehicles including the use of restricted stock. 36 In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 modifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs, and the manner in which companies allocate fixed overhead expenses to inventory. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Teradyne does not expect SFAS 151 to have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results From time to time, information we provide, statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Form 10 K) contain statements that are not purely historical, but are forward looking statements, made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, forward looking statements made herein include projections, plans and objectives for our business, financial condition, operating results, future operations, or future economic performance, statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements, capital expenditures, expectations as to customer orders and demand for our products and statements relating to backlog, bookings and cancellations, gross margins and pricing considerations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, which could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. These factors, and others, are discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Business Is Impacted by Worldwide Economic Cycles, Which Are Difficult to Predict. Capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries, such as Teradyne, have, in the past, been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies, and resulting reductions in customer capital investments. Future slowdowns in global economies and reductions in customer capital investments, which may adversely impact our business, are difficult to predict. Acts of War, Terrorists Attacks and the Threat of Domestic and International Terrorist Attacks May Adversely Impact Our Business. Acts of war and terrorists attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, customers, suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. As we sell and manufacture products both in the United States and internationally, the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business. Such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems. All of these conditions make it difficult for us, and our customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Business is Dependent on the Current and Anticipated Market for Electronics, Which Historically Have Been Highly Cyclical. Our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. The market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns and the effects of hostile acts. Historically, the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply, which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment, including systems we manufacture and market. We believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations. We are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters. In addition, any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 37 We Have Taken Measures to Address the Slowdown in the Market for Our Products Which Could Have Long term Negative Effects on Our Business. During 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, we took measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products. In particular, we reduced our workforce, closed and or sold facilities, discontinued certain product lines, implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced planned capital expenditures and expense budgets. Each measure we took to address such slowdowns could have long term negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, increasing our debt, and making it more difficult to respond to customers or competitors, as the market and customer orders turn around. We May Not Be Able to Adequately Address a Rapid Increase in Customer Demand. Because we took measures in recent years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services, we may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand. Our ability to meet rapid increases in customer demand is also, to a certain extent, dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements, over which we have little or no control. Our Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Acquisitions Which May Affect Our Ability to Manage and Maintain Our Business. Since our inception, we have acquired a number of businesses. In the future, we may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement our existing operations. Such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; the costs associated with and or the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into our culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; the inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business; the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business; the possibility that our reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business; potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business, including but not limited to regulatory, environmental and tax liabilities; significant underperformance of the acquired business relative to our expectations; the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles, which may adversely affect our reported results of operations; and litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions. For example, in connection with the August 2000 acquisition of each of Herco Technology Corp., a California company, and Perception Laminates, Inc., a California company, a complaint was filed on or about September 5, 2001 and is now pending in Federal District Court, San Diego, California, by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants Teradyne and two of our executive officers. This case is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. Additionally, in 2001, we were designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a clean up site in Los Angeles, California. This claim arises out of our acquisition of Perception Laminates, Inc. in August 2000. Prior to that date, Perception Laminates had itself acquired certain assets of Alco Industries Inc. under an asset purchase agreement dated July 30, 1992. This matter is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. 38 We Currently Are and in the Future May Be Subject to Litigation that Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. From time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. For example, on April 30, 2004, Hampshire Equity Partners II, L.P. (HEP), filed a complaint against Teradyne and Teradyne Connection Systems segment (TCS) asserting fraud and negligence based claims, and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity. In the complaint, HEP alleges that it relied upon statements made by a representative of TCS to a HEP agent during its due diligence prior to investing $55 million in Connector Services Corporation, aka AMAX Plating, Inc (CSC). HEP seeks to hold Teradyne and TCS responsible for its decision to invest in CSC and for the losses it has suffered upon the bankruptcy of CSC. HEP seeks damages in an unstated amount exceeding $55 million. The case is currently pending in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. Management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. This case is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. Our Business May be Adversely Impacted by Divestitures of Lines of Business Which May Affect Our Ability to Manage and Maintain Our Business. Since our inception, we have divested certain lines of business. In the future, we may undertake additional such divestitures. Such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on our culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business; restructuring, inventory and other charges which may affect our results of operations; and the decreased diversification of our product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make our operating results subject to increased market fluctuations. If We Are Unable to Protect Our Intellectual Property, We May Lose a Valuable Asset or May Incur Costly Litigation to Protect Our Rights. Our products incorporate technology that we protect in several ways, including patents, copyrights, trade secrets and by contract (IP). However, even with these protections, our IP may still be challenged, invalidated or subject to other infringement actions. While we believe that our IP has value in the aggregate, no single element of our IP is in itself essential. If a significant portion of our IP is invalidated or ineffective, our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against us, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products, or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results. If We Fail to Develop New Technologies to Adapt to Our Customers Needs and if Our Customers Fail to Accept Our New Products, Our Revenues Will Be Adversely Affected. We believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers. In a rapidly evolving market, such as ours, the development of new technologies, 39 commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success. Successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors, including: new product selection; ability to meet customer requirements; development of competitive products by competitors; timely and efficient completion of product design; timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing; and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations. We Are Subject to Intense Competition. We face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. We also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers. Some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products. Moreover, increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We Are Subject to Risks of Operating Internationally. A significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the United States. Our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including: unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; changes in tariffs and exchange rates; social, political and economic instability, acts of terrorism and international conflicts; difficulties in accounts receivable collection; cultural differences in the conduct of business; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; potentially adverse tax consequences; and compliance with customs regulations. In addition, an increasingly large portion of our products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations, including China, and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in Taiwan, Singapore, China and other parts of Asia. As a result, we are subject to a number of economic and other risks, particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions. Disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business. Our Business May Suffer if We Are Unable to Attract and Retain Key Employees. Competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees. The loss of one or more key or other employees, our inability to attract additional qualified employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 40 If Our Suppliers do not Meet Product or Delivery Requirements, We Could Have Reduced Revenues and Earnings. Certain components, including semiconductor chips, may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. Approximately 30% of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive. If any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products, and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom we do not exercise any control. We are also dependent on the financial strength of our suppliers and may be subject to litigation arising from our relationships with suppliers and others. There can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Incur Significant Liabilities if We Fail to Comply With Environmental Regulations. We are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. If we fail to comply with present and future regulations, or are required to perform site remediation, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also: restrict our ability to expand facilities; require us to acquire costly equipment; or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses. Pursuant to present regulations and agreements, we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2004, we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire sites. On January 27, 2003, the European Union adopted the following directives: (i) the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the RoHS Directive); and (ii) the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the WEEE Directive). Both the RoHs Directive and the WEEE Directive will alter the type and manner in which electronic equipment is imported, sold and handled in the European Union. Ensuring compliance with the RoHs Directive and the WEEE Directive and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus, could have a negative impact on the business, operations and financial condition. The RoHs Directive and the WEEE Directive will be become effective on July 6, 2006 and August 13, 2005, respectively. We Have Substantially Increased Our Indebtedness. On October 24, 2001, we completed a private placement of $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due October 15, 2006 and received net proceeds of $389 million. As a result, we have incurred approximately $400 million principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult to make payments on our debt and other obligations; 41 make it difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service for indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; place us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. During the year ended December 31, 2004, and in the first quarter of 2005, Teradyne took steps to reduce its indebtedness, including repurchasing a total of $28.5 million of the Notes on the open market pursuant to the Board of Directors authorization given to management to repurchase up to $100 million of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 101.50. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations, including our obligations under the Notes. We May Not Be Able to Satisfy Certain Obligations in the Event of a Change in Control. The indenture governing the Notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of Teradyne. If a change in control occurs, the holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of the Notes not previously called for redemption. The price that we are required to pay is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, together with interest accrued but unpaid to, but excluding, the repurchase date. At our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, instead of paying the repurchase price in cash, we may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at 95% of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date. If we are required to repurchase the Notes, there is no guarantee that we will have enough funds to pay such amounts. As a result, a change in control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Not Be Able to Pay Our Debt and Other Obligations. If our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes or certain of our other obligations, we would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the Notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations. Moreover, we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes at maturity. We May Need Additional Financing, Which Could Be Difficult to Obtain. We expect that our existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. However, we have a finite amount of cash and in the event we may need to raise additional funds, due to losses or other reasons, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. Further, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Future financings may place restrictions on how we operate our business. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm our business. 42 We Will Be Required to Account for Options Under Our Employee Stock Plans as a Compensation Expense, Which Will Adversely Affect Our Operating Results There has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options. We currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 123R or any other future laws and regulations requiring us to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations will adversely affect operating results. Note B: Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share if it had been in effect during the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are additional stock based compensation disclosures. Provisions of Our Charter and By Laws and Massachusetts Law Make a Takeover of Teradyne More Difficult. Our basic corporate documents, our stockholder rights plan and Massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders. Our Operating Results Are Likely to Fluctuate Significantly. Our annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability. The following factors set out below are expected to impact future operations: competitive pressures on selling prices; our ability to introduce and the market acceptance of new products planned for 2005 and beyond; changes in product revenue mix resulting from changes in customer demand; the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter resulting from the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and constraints occurring at the end of a quarter, or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business; engineering and development investments relating to new product introductions in 2005 and beyond, and the expansion of manufacturing and engineering operations in Asia; the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, especially if product demand increases rapidly; provisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products; and impairment charges for certain long lived assets. In particular, due to the introduction of a number of new, complex test systems in 2003 and 2004 and the planned introduction of other systems in 2005 and beyond, there can be no assurance that we will not experience delays in shipment of our products or that our products will achieve customer acceptance. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 43 We have Significant Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations From time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products, guarantee certain indebtedness obligations of our subsidiary companies and have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers, directors, employees and agents, to the extent permitted by law, arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer, director, employee or agent, is or was serving at our request in such capacity. If we become liable under any of these obligations, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. For additional information regarding Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations see Part I, Note J: Commitments and Contingencies in this Form 10 K. In addition to the guarantee and indemnification obligations set forth in this 10 K, Teradyne occasionally guarantees the performance obligations and responsibilities of its subsidiary and affiliate companies. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in European and Japanese currencies. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management Teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. Debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Since the Notes were out of the money at year end, they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On these bases, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $0.9 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 44 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of Teradynes plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Teradynes actual results could differ 15 materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to Teradynes customers upon shipment. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, Teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur. For equipment that includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product, revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require Teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, Teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of Teradyne. Teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Teradynes post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. Teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and Teradyne defers revenue in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 90 1. Teradynes products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. Teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. 16 Connection Systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements. Teradyne does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position No. 97 2 (SOP 97 2), Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans Teradyne accounts for its director and employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Teradynes employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan. Teradynes stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25. Accordingly, there have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid in capital. Teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. See Note B: Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). In interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, SFAS 123R would eliminate the ability to 17 account for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value based method under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to calculate equity based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. Under SFAS 123R, equity based compensation is required to be recognized in companies financial statements. Teradyne expects to adopt SFAS 123R in the third quarter of 2005, as required. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, had SFAS 123R been effective, Teradyne would have recognized additional non cash equity based compensation expense of $91.8 million, $85.1 million, and $110.3 million, respectively, applying the provisions of SFAS 123. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at December 31, 2003 and 2004. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence, including sustained profitability, exists that realization is more likely than not. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets Teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors Teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of Teradynes use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When Teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, Teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. Teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The volatility of the industries that Teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows, which can impact their ability to make required payments. Teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customers current payment history, the customers current financial statements and other information regarding the customers credit worthiness. If the financial condition of Teradynes customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. 18 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Percentage of net revenue: Net Revenue: Products 86.8 % 82.5 % 81.2 % Service 13.2 17.5 18.8 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of Revenues: Cost of products 50.4 59.0 67.9 Cost of service 9.2 11.5 13.1 Total cost of revenue 59.6 70.5 81.0 Gross Profit 40.4 29.5 19.0 Operating Expenses: Engineering and development 14.6 18.8 24.0 Selling and administrative 15.0 18.4 23.8 Restructuring and other charges 0.3 5.3 10.2 Goodwill impairment 6.5 Gain on the sale of a business 29.9 42.5 64.5 Net interest and other (expense) income (0.7 ) (0.4 ) Income (loss) before income taxes 10.5 (13.7 ) (45.9 ) Provision for income taxes 1.3 0.6 12.9 Net income (loss) 9.2 % (14.3 )% (58.8 )% Results of Operations: Bookings Teradynes net orders for its four reportable segments for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PercentChange 2002 2003PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 1,036.4 $ 837.9 $ 480.5 24 % 74 % Connection Systems 384.8 317.7 149.8 21 112 Assembly Test Systems 162.1 156.6 167.8 4 (7 ) Other Test Systems 107.6 105.9 107.2 2 (1 ) $ 1,690.9 $ 1,418.1 $ 905.3 19 % 57 % From 2003 to 2004, Semiconductor Test Systems bookings increased due to growth in the overall system on a chip (SOC) tester market (excluding memory testers). Semiconductor Test Systems bookings within the SOC market showed a continuation of the growth in Asian markets from 2003 into 2004, mainly related to Subcons in Taiwan and Singapore. Over 2004, Teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs in the wireless, broadband, consumer electronics, and mass storage/datacom markets, which are serviced by the J750, Catalyst and FLEX products, and whose chips are sold mainly by European and U.S. semiconductor companies. Many of these chips are fabricated and tested by Foundries and 19 Subcons in many parts of Asia, but concentrated in Taiwan and Singapore. The economic downturn which prevailed in past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs. As a result, an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource non core competency testing needs to Subcons in low cost regions. As total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings have grown, the bookings from Subcons have continued to make up a large percentage of total orders. Bookings from Subcons increased 45% to $443 million in 2004 from $307 million in 2003, and made up 43% of bookings in 2004 compared to 37% in 2003. Semiconductor Test Systems backlog increased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to increased orders from Subcons and Foundries located in the Asian markets. The growth in Connection Systems orders from 2003 to 2004 was a result of continued spending for wireless network deployments in the United States and Europe as well as an increase in network spending for both the enterprise and service provider markets. The computer/server market was also strong. Bookings were up appreciably for Connection Systems VHDM HSD backplane interconnect product lines as well as the NeXLev family of high speed, high density mezzanine connectors. Similar to 2003, the growth in orders was partially offset by a decline in orders due to the decision to exit a portion of Connection Systems lower margin EMS product line. The increase in Connection Systems bookings from 2002 to 2003 was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in 2003, as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market, driven by wireless network deployments, which increased for both U.S. and European telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the first half of 2003. Orders in the Assembly Test Systems segment increased from 2003 to 2004, primarily driven by increases in the mil/aero business and increased sales of in circuit products. The growth in these areas was offset by a decline in orders resulting from the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines in 2003. The net decrease in Assembly Test Systems orders from 2002 to 2003 is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines. This decrease was offset by a 25% increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the Mil/Aero business, which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of 2003. Teradynes cancellations for its four reportable segments for the last three years are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 10.5 $ 6.9 $ 52.5 Connection Systems 16.0 104.3 Assembly Test Systems 0.2 2.5 2.2 Other Test Systems $ 10.7 $ 25.4 $ 159.0 Semiconductor Test Systems experienced $10.5 million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in 2004. Approximately 50% of this amount was related to cancellations, while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to managements estimate of what may be canceled in future periods. The Connection Systems cancellations in 2003 were from major customers in the telecommunications and networking infrastructure industries, due principally to product program cancellations. 20 Teradynes net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 United States 32 % 35 % 44 % South East Asia 19 18 13 Europe 17 17 18 Taiwan 15 10 6 Singapore 11 11 8 Japan 5 8 9 Rest of the World 1 1 2 100 % 100 % 100 % For the past three years, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its four reportable segments is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 224.1 $ 333.7 $ 240.0 Connection Systems 80.5 75.6 104.2 Assembly Test Systems 63.8 56.1 53.4 Other Test Systems 38.8 40.7 43.3 $ 407.2 $ 506.1 $ 440.9 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2004, 2003, and 2002 there were no significant cancellation penalties received. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders, Teradynes backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Teradynes business, financial condition, and results of operations. Revenue Teradynes net revenue for its four reportable segments for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PercentChange 2002 2003PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 1,146.3 $ 735.4 $ 557.5 56 % 32 % Connection Systems 381.7 357.2 397.0 7 (10 ) Assembly Test Systems 155.2 151.6 170.8 2 (11 ) Other Test Systems 108.7 108.7 96.9 12 $ 1,791.9 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 32 % 11 % The increase in Semiconductor Test Systems sales from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to growth in the overall SOC test market, and a share gain by Semiconductor Test Systems in that market. The worldwide market for semiconductor test equipment (excluding memory testers) grew by approximately 34% in 2004. Semiconductor Test Systems share in that market grew from 2003 to 2004. Much of the increased sales for Semiconductor Test Systems came from Subcon customers for use in their Asian facilities, primarily in Singapore and Taiwan. The revenue derived from Subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal SOC customers, led by sales of Catalyst and FLEX systems. As is described in the Bookings section, Semiconductor Test Systems has seen growth in revenue from 2003 to 2004 due to increased need for testing in the wireless, broadband, and to a lesser extent, mass storage/datacom sectors. Sales of the J750 product were also relatively strong in 2004, serving the microcontroller and high volume logic customer segments. Similar to the increase in sales from 2003 to 2004, the increase from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to increased demand from Subcons located in the Asian markets, particularly, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia. 21 Connection Systems sales in 2004 increased to $381.7 million led by stronger customer demand for Connection Systems high speed, high density interconnect products, which more than offset the decrease in sales associated with the exiting of the lower margin EMS business in 2003. Connection Systems sales declined from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin EMS business. The segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years. The increase in Assembly Test Systems sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to increases in both the commercial and mil/aero businesses. Commercial business growth was due to increased sales of in circuit test products, while the increase in mil/aero sales was generated by a number of large projects which were undertaken in 2004. These increases were offset, in part, by decreases from the sale of the manual x ray, rework and AOI product lines in 2003. From 2002 through 2003, the commercial business saw decreases in revenue, particularly due to the sale of product lines referenced above, while mil/aero revenue increased slightly year over year . Teradynes four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2004 2003 2002 Semiconductor Test Systems 64 % 55 % 46 % Connection Systems 21 26 32 Assembly Test Systems 9 11 14 Other Test Systems 6 8 8 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 United States 30 % 37 % 46 % Europe 15 17 18 South East Asia 20 17 11 Singapore 13 11 8 Taiwan 15 9 9 Japan 5 8 6 Rest of the World 2 1 2 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PercentChange 2002 2003PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Product Revenue $ 1,554.8 $ 1,115.9 $ 992.1 39 % 12 % Service Revenue 237.1 237.0 230.1 3 $ 1,791.9 $ 1,352.9 $ 1,222.2 32 % 11 % Service revenue is derived from the servicing of Teradynes installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, Teradynes three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 18%, 21% and 23% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. 22 Gross Margin 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PointChange 2002 2003PointChange (dollars in millions) Gross Margin $ 723.9 $ 398.9 $ 232.7 Percent of Total Revenue 40.4 % 29.5 % 19.0 % 10.9 10.5 The gross margin improvement from 2003 to 2004 was the result of several factors. An improvement of 9 points is credited to an increase in sales volumes and a shift in the mix of revenues, with higher Semiconductor Test Systems content which has higher incremental margins. The remainder is attributable to lower material costs and a reduction in fixed manufacturing costs, including depreciation and facility costs resulting from past restructuring actions. Teradynes gross margin improvement from 2002 to 2003 was impacted by a variety of factors, including an improvement of 4.9 points related to reduced manufacturing costs and increased volume levels, and an improvement of 2.5 points related to an increase in volume and a shift in product mix. Inventory provisions decreased from $39.0 million in 2002 to $16.6 million in 2003, which contributed a 2.0 point gross margin improvement. The breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PointChange 2002 2003PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Margin $ 651.4 $ 317.1 $ 163.0 Percent of Product Revenue 41.9 % 28.4 % 16.4 % 13.5 12.0 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004PointChange 2002 2003PointChange (dollars in millions) Service Gross Margin $ 72.5 $ 81.8 $ 69.7 Percent of Service Revenue 30.6 % 34.5 % 30.3 % (3.9 ) 4.2 Teradyne assesses the carrying value of its inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed, is written down to estimated net realizable value. These write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components. Sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision which is recorded in cost of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2004, Teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of $3.5 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Of the $11.3 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $6.2 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems, $3.0 million related to Assembly Test Systems, $1.6 million related to Connection Systems and $0.5 million related to Other Test Systems. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of $7.4 million and $9.2 million, respectively. Of the $16.6 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $9.3 million related to Assembly Test Systems which included $3.6 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing, distributing and primary support of the AOI product line and $5.2 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems SOC parts and components. 23 During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of $28.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Of the $39.0 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $27.9 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems, including $20.7 million of memory test inventory related to Probe One and J996 product line discontinuances. The Probe One and J996 inventory had been fully written off as of December 31, 2003. There is no material exposure remaining for the Probe One or J996 products. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Teradyne sold inventory that was previously reserved for which had a gross margin impact of $2.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Teradyne scrapped $44.8 million, $30.3 million, and $22.8 million of inventory which had been previously written down or written off during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Teradyne had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of $153.9 million and $191.1 million, respectively. Of the reserves at December 31, 2004, $10.5 million, $12.6 million, $3.6 million, and $127.2 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2004, 2003, 2002, and prior to 2002, respectively. Of the reserves at December 31, 2003, $16.6 million, $20.2 million, and $154.3 million related to inventory provisions recorded in 2003, 2002 and prior to 2002, respectively. Engineering and Development 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004Change 2002 2003Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 262.0 $ 254.6 $ 293.9 $ 7.4 $ (39.3 ) Percent of Total Revenue 14.6 % 18.8 % 24.0 % During 2004, Teradyne maintained its commitment to sustained levels of investment in research through continued engineering and development spending. More than two thirds of Teradynes total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between $150 $250 million. During 2002 and 2003, Semiconductor Test Systems reduced the number of platforms under major development, which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms. The consolidation of multiple product divisions within Semiconductor Test Systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation. The increase of $7 million in engineering and development spending from 2003 to 2004 consists of the following amounts: $7 million increase due to variable employee compensation; $6 million increase in prototype material for engineering development projects; $4 million increase in outsourced project engineering; and $1 million increase in travel and training costs; These increases were offset in part by the following: $6 million decrease in salaries and fringe benefits due to a decrease in headcount, offset by salary increases effective July 1, 2004; and 24 $5 million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending, including a decrease of $2 million in accelerated depreciation related to asset writedowns and facility closures in 2003. The reduction in engineering and development expenses from 2002 to 2003 resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within Semiconductor Test Systems and Assembly Test Systems. The elimination of memory test within the Semiconductor Test Systems segment resulted in a reduction of $5 million in engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003. In addition, Semiconductor Test Systems consolidated engineering facilities, outsourced certain software engineering development to a low cost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce costs. As a result of the sale in Assembly Test Systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products, engineering expenses from 2002 to 2003 decreased by approximately $15 million. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts: $16 million as a result of a workforce reduction, partially offset by a $10 million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases in the third quarter of 2002; $13 million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering; $4 million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the recent writedown of assets, as well as the trend to rent or lease, rather than purchase, development tools; and $3 million from reduced office and facility costs.

The decrease in spending from 2002 to 2003 was principally due to the following approximate amounts: $18 million as a result of a workforce reduction, partially offset by a $3 million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases; $12 million in reduced utility costs from the consolidation of facilities, lower promotional spending and travel cutbacks; $7 million from a decrease in consulting spending and legal fees; and $4 million in lower depreciation due to the writedown of assets. 25 Restructuring and Other Charges The tables below represent activity related to restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. The accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings. The accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. Teradyne expects to pay out approximately $7.0 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Teradynes future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $13 million as of December 31, 2004. Teradyne has subleased approximately 52% of its unoccupied space as of December 31, 2004 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space. The table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended December 31, 2004 relating to restructuring and other charges (in thousands): Long LivedAssetImpairment SeveranceandBenefits FacilityRelated OtherCharges Total Balance at December 31, 2003 $ $ 7,766 $ 29,222 $ 1,273 $ 38,261 2004 provision (reversal) 810 2,864 3,188 (1,503 ) 5,359 Cash payments (7,570 ) (11,182 ) 1,259 (17,493 ) Asset write downs (810 ) (810 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ $ 3,060 $ 21,228 $ 1,029 $ 25,317 During the year ended December 31, 2004, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges: $1.4 million reversal due to revised estimates related to long lived asset impairment charges that had previously been recorded where the impaired assets sold for more than their respective carrying amounts, and $2.2 million of charges for certain long lived assets that were impaired as the estimated value of such assets was less than the carrying amount. The Assembly Test Systems segment recorded $1.1 million of this charge and $0.9 million was recorded in the Connection Systems segment. The remainder of the charge was recorded across other reportable segments. $5.0 million charge taken for severance and related benefits. This charge is offset by a $2.1 million reversal of estimates on future benefits for severed employees. There were approximately 184 employees terminated in the year ended December 31, 2004 across Teradyne. $3.2 million charge for revised estimates of losses due to changes in the assumed amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. The Connection Systems, Assembly Test and Semiconductor Test segments recorded $2.0 million, $1.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively. $1.5 million net reversal of other charges consisting of $1.4 million of amounts realized under agreements related to product lines that were sold, and $0.1 million of revisions of estimates of liabilities incurred during restructuring activities, both of which occurred in prior reporting periods in the Assembly Test and Other Test Systems segments. The restructuring actions taken in 2004 are expected to generate cost savings of approximately $13.8 million million annually across all areas of operations. During 2004, Teradyne recorded a gain on the sale of a business of $0.9 million. This amount related to an earn out provision from a divestiture in the Connection Systems segment in 1999, and has been classified as a gain on the sale of business in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. 26 The table below summarizes the liability and activity for the year ended December 31, 2003 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment SeveranceandBenefits Loss onSale ofProductLines FacilityRelated OtherCharges Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 8,242 $ $ 25,240 $ $ 33,482 2003 provision 29,403 21,367 6,891 12,350 1,273 71,284 Cash payments (21,843 ) (8,368 ) (30,211 ) Asset writedowns (29,403 ) (6,891 ) (36,294 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ $ 7,766 $ $ 29,222 $ 1,273 $ 38,261 During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges: $29.4 million charge, primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets, including $11.2 million for the sale and leaseback of certain manufacturing assets, and $7.8 million for a reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale in the Connection Systems segment. The charge for the Semiconductor Test Systems segment of $3.5 million related primarily to a reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale, and $6.9 million related to the impairment of manufacturing assets held for sale in the Assembly Test Systems segment. $21.4 million charge for severance and related benefits. There were approximately 890 employees terminated in 2003 across Teradyne. $8.1 million charge for the loss on sale of product lines, of which $6.9 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges and $1.2 million has been recorded in cost of sales. The product lines sold were in the Assembly Test Systems segment and the Other Systems segment. In the first quarter of 2003, the Assembly Test Systems segment sold its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line for total cash proceeds of $2.1 million. These transactions resulted in a loss of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 of which $6.2 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges, and $0.5 million has been recorded in cost of sales. In the year ended December 31, 2003, the Other Test Systems Segment recorded a charge of $1.4 million to write down its net assets relating to the sale of the Autodiagnosis automotive after market product line of which $0.7 million has been recorded in restructuring and other charges and $0.7 million has been recorded in cost of sales. $12.4 million charge consisting primarily of revised estimates of losses due to changes in the assumed amount and timing of sublease income on facilities that have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. The Connection Systems segment recorded $3.2 million of this charge and $8.7 million was recorded in the Assembly Test Systems segment. The remainder of the charge was recorded across other operating segments. $1.3 million charge primarily for contractual penalties associated with resizing the Connections Systems segment. The restructuring actions taken in 2003 were expected to generate cost savings of approximately $86.3 million annually across all areas of operations. 27 The table below summarizes activity for the year ended December 31, 2002 relating to restructuring and other charges: Long LivedAssetImpairment FacilityRelated SeveranceandBenefits Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2001 $ $ 1,676 8,471 $ 10,147 2002 provision 76,994 25,751 22,495 125,240 Cash payments (2,187 ) (22,724 ) (24,911 ) Asset writedowns (76,994 ) (76,994 ) Balance at December 31, 2002 $ $ 25,240 $ 8,242 $ 33,482 During the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to restructuring and other charges: $77.0 million charge primarily for certain long lived assets held for sale that were impaired as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of these assets. The charges included machinery and equipment, facilities held for sale and intangible assets. All of the machinery and equipment and facilities have been sold or disposed of as of December 31, 2004. $25.8 million charge related to future lease commitments for vacated manufacturing and administrative space which have been exited prior to the end of the lease term. $22.5 million charge for severance and related benefits. There were approximately 1,010 employees terminated across Teradyne during the year ended December 31, 2002. For further details on Teradynes restructuring and other charges during 2004, 2003 and 2002 see Note L: Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2005, Teradyne committed to a restructuring plan (the Plan) as part of an ongoing effort to lower expenses. Pursuant to the Plan, Teradyne believes that it will incur costs for severance and related employee benefits, impairment charges and remaining lease obligations related to a vacated facility, and other charges. The total charges expected to be incurred under the Plan are $11.0 million. The actions taken in accordance with the Plan are expected to generate cost savings of approximately $18.4 million annually, primarily in the Connection Systems and Assembly Test segments. Through March 11, 2005, Teradyne has incurred charges of approximately $8.2 million, related to severance and related employee benefits, remaining lease obligations and related asset impairments, and other charges. Goodwill Impairment Unless conditions dictate otherwise, Teradynes annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Teradyne tested the Assembly Test Systems and Connection Systems reporting units, for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. During the quarter ended September 28, 2003, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for the fiscal years 2004 through 2006 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 112 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 28, 2003. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. 28 During the quarter ended September 29, 2002, as a result of contraction in the Assembly Test Systems market to its lowest level in a decade as evidenced by various market reports available to Teradyne, Teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue, bookings and profit for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 from the previous quarters forecast for the Assembly Test Systems segment and reduced its workforce by 94 employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook. As a result, Teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the Assembly Test Systems segment as of September 29, 2002. Teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment exceeded its fair value and recognized a $78.5 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the Assembly Test Systems segment to its carrying value. The fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. Interest Income and Expense 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004Change 2002 2003Change (in millions) Interest income $ 15.4 $ 14.0 $ 17.0 $ 1.4 $ (3.0 ) Interest expense $ (18.8 ) $ (20.9 ) $ (21.8 ) $ 2.1 $ 0.9 The increase in interest income from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to an increase in interest rates in the latter half of 2004 and increased cash balances throughout 2004. The decrease in interest income from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. The decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 and from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of Teradynes California mortgage of $42.3 million in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003 and all of 2004, as well as the repurchase of $8.5 million of Teradynes 3.75% Convertible Notes in the third quarter of 2004. Other Income and Expense, Net Other income and expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 includes the following: Income/(expense) 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Gain on sale of investment (1) $ 2,584 $ 2,800 $ Collection of loan (2) 585 7,144 Other than temporary impairment of common stock investment (267 ) (3,115 ) Fair value adjustment on warrants (366 ) 138 (2,051 ) Mortgage prepayment penalty (3) (3,220 ) Other than temporary impairment of investment (2,592 ) Writedown of investment in an engineering service provider (2,288 ) Total $ 2,536 $ (2,874 ) $ (310 ) (1) Gain on sale of an investment in common stock. (2) The loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection. (3) Penalties related to prepayment of a $42.3 million mortgage loan collateralized against certain California real estate properties, which was to mature on January 1, 2007. 29 Income (loss) before Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004Change 2002 2003Change (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 199.4 $ (60.1 ) $ (266.1 ) $ 259.5 $ 206.0 Connection Systems 25.2 (36.0 ) (79.6 ) 61.2 43.6 Assembly Test Systems (72.8 ) (200.4 ) 72.8 127.6 Other Test Systems 6.8 2.5 1.2 4.3 1.3 Corporate (43.5 ) (19.8 ) (16.0 ) (23.7 ) (3.8 ) Total $ 187.9 $ (186.2 ) $ (560.9 ) $ 374.1 $ 374.7 The change to an income position from a loss position from 2003 to 2004 was mainly attributable to increased sales in the Semiconductor, Connector and Assembly Test Systems segments, as well as continued cost reductions throughout the company. The decrease in the loss before income taxes from 2002 to 2003 in Semiconductor Test Systems, Connection Systems, and Assembly Test Systems was primarily due to cost reduction actions in the respective segments and market conditions during the year. Other Test Systems income before income taxes increased primarily due to increased revenues from 2002 to 2003. Income Taxes For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes. Tax expense for 2004 also included an IRS settlement related to the closing out of tax years 1999 through 2001. During 2004, Teradyne utilized previously reserved net operating losses to reduce taxable income and lower the effective tax rate. Teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003. Until sufficient positive evidence exists, including an appropriate level of profitability, Teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence, including sustained profitability, exists that realization is more likely than not. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were 12.1% and 4.2%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision of $157.5 million resulting in a tax rate of 28%. The tax rate of 28% is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Teradyne recorded a tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. The evidence that Teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of 2002 included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year 2002 compared to earlier Teradyne forecasts, the inability to get to break even during 2002 despite implementing several restructuring programs, and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year 2003. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized. 30 Contractual Obligations The following table reflects Teradynes contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: PurchaseObligations Non cancelableLeaseCommitments* InterestonDebt** ConvertibleSenior Notes PensionFunding NotesPayable OtherDebt Total (in thousands) 2005 $ 146,518 $ 27,681 $ 14,877 $ $ 30,000 $ 4,826 $ 321 $ 224,223 2006 16,862 14,871 391,500 321 423,554 2007 14,235 184 321 14,740 2008 6,527 179 321 7,027 2009 5,759 173 321 6,253 Beyond 2009 12,817 525 6,148 19,490 Total $ 146,518 $ 83,881 $ 30,809 $ 391,500 $ 30,000 $ 4,826 $ 7,753 $ 695,287 * Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income of $9.6 million due in the future under non cancelable subleases. ** Includes interest on convertible notes. Pension funding requirements are not known beyond 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $105.2 million in 2004 from 2003, to $691.2 million. Teradynes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $44.9 million in 2003 from 2002, to $586.0 million and increased $45.1 million in 2002 from 2001, to $541.1 million. Cash activity for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 2003 2004Change 2002 2003Change Cash provided by (used for) operating activities: Cash provided by (used for) net income (loss), adjusted for non cash items: $ 299.7 $ 15.3 $ (207.4 ) $ 284.4 $ 222.7 Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired (44.9 ) 18.9 203.1 (63.8 ) (184.2 ) Total cash provided by (used for) operating activities 254.8 34.2 (4.3 ) 220.6 38.5 Cash used for investing activities (292.9 ) (114.4 ) (102.2 ) (178.5 ) (12.2 ) Cash provided by financing activities 18.8 57.1 40.4 (38.3 ) 16.7 Total $ (19.3 ) $ (23.1 ) $ (66.1 ) $ 3.8 $ 43.0 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired used cash of $44.9 million in 2004 as inventory balances increased $16.0 million across each of Teradynes segments, although primarily in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, and accounts payable, deferred revenue and accruals decreased by $42.3 million, which includes a contribution to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan of approximately $35.6 million. The inventory, accounts payable, deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by a decrease of $6.0 million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an decrease in days sales outstanding, based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues, from 59 days in 2003 to 54 days in 2004. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $18.9 million in 2003 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of $56.3 million across all segments. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $203.1 million in 2002 primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund in March of 2002. 31 Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, proceeds from asset disposals, proceeds from the sale of product lines, cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures increased by $84.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Additions of internally constructed systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment accounted for approximately $69.2 million of the increase in capital expenditures due to the recent introduction of the FLEX platform. The remainder of the increase was attributable to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across Teradyne to support the increase in revenues in 2004 and continued investment in research and development. Capital expenditures were $165.2 million in 2004, $81.2 million in 2003, and $76.4 million in 2002. Financing activities include sales of Teradynes common stock, as well as repayments of debt. During 2004 and 2003, repayments of long term debt used cash of $11.5 million and $43.4 million, respectively as Teradyne repurchased a portion of its outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2004, and prepaid its mortgage on its California properties in the third quarter of 2003. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $30.3 million, $100.5 million, and $41.2 million, respectively. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne issued $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 (the Notes) in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Teradyne began making annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Teradyne that rank equally with Teradynes existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In the event of a change in control by which Teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, the holders of the Notes may be able to require Teradyne to redeem some or all of the Notes either in discounted Teradyne common stock or in cash. On February 8, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a Registration Statement on Form S 3 covering both the Notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted. On or after October 18, 2004, Teradyne may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below. The redemption price, expressed as a percentage of principal amount, is as follows for the designated periods: Period RedemptionPrice Beginning on October 18, 2004 and ending on October 14, 2005 101.50 % Beginning on October 15, 2005 and ending on October 14, 2006 100.75 % and thereafter equal to 100% of the principal amount. The Board of Directors of Teradyne has authorized management to repurchase up to $100 million of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 101.50. In the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, Teradyne repurchased $8.5 million and $20.0 million of the Notes, respectively. The decision to repurchase a portion of the Notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the redemption price during the period. Currently, management intends to repurchase the Notes on the open market through negotiated transactions when management believes that such price is beneficial to Teradyne. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing of when and the amount of the Notes that management may elect to repurchase, including the price of the available Notes, Teradynes stock price, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities, prevailing interest rates, and Teradynes anticipated liquidity needs. 32 If, at some point in the future, Teradynes stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, management may elect to convert a portion of the Notes into equity, to avoid the continuation of interest payments and to conserve capital. However, there can be no assurance that even if Teradynes stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the Notes will convert into equity as Teradynes stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date. If this were to occur, Teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the Notes called into cash. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including Teradynes stock price, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities and Teradynes anticipated liquidity needs. Teradyne believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $691.2 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $30.0 million in 2005 to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan which is currently under funded. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans Teradynes pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit plan, was approximately $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which was 0.73% of Teradynes cost of revenue and operating expenses. The largest portion of Teradynes 2004 pension expense was $5.7 million for its U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected return on plan assets for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets of 8%. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, Teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Teradyne also considered its historical 15 year compounded return of 8.41% for the period ending December 31, 2003, which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Based on these historical returns, Teradyne believes that 8% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2004. Teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust these returns as necessary. The current asset allocation for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 48.1% invested in equity securities and 51.9% invested in fixed income securities, which is in accordance with the plans asset allocation requirements. Teradynes actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2004 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model. Teradynes investment manager regularly reviews Teradynes actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with Teradynes targeted allocations. Teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2004 in the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan Teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately $6.2 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that Teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index (formerly Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index), which was at 5.68% at December 31, 2004, down from 6.00% at December 31, 2003. As a result, Teradyne selected 5.75% for its December 31, 2004 discount rate, which was down from 6% as of December 31, 2003. Each year Teradyne considers the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, along with other indices including the Moodys AA rated corporate bond yield and the Citigroup 10+ Year AAA/AA rate. Teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan will be approximately $5.7 million, $5.1 million and $4.7 million in fiscal 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. The pension expense estimates are based on a 5.75% discount rate. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in Teradynes pension plans. 33 Teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2004, if Teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 5% 6% 7% (in millions) 7% $ 10.8 $ 7.3 $ 4.0 8% 9.3 5.7 2.4 9% 7.7 4.2 0.9 Teradynes funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $121.6 million at December 31, 2003 to $165.9 million at December 31, 2004. The investment performance returns and Teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $70.9 million at December 31, 2003 to $37.9 million at December 31, 2004. During 2004, Teradyne contributed $35.6 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $30.0 million in 2005 to this plan. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to Teradynes 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note P: Stock Based Compensation, Teradyne maintains three equity compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance to Teradynes employees, directors and or consultants: 1) 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan; 2) 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan; and 3) 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan. The purpose of these plans is to promote the interests of Teradyne by attracting and retaining the services of qualified and talented persons to serve as employees, directors and or consultants of Teradyne. Except for the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of the foregoing plans was approved by Teradynes shareholders. The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2004: Plan category Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights Weighted average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under stock option compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column(1)) (shares in thousands) Stock option plans approved by shareholders 5,427 $ 22.73 2,856 Stock option plans not approved by shareholders(1) 25,329 22.23 16,777 Total 30,756 $ 22.31 19,633 34 (1) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), Teradyne assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of Teradyne common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of Teradyne common stock for each share of GenRad common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2004, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 260 shares of Teradyne common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $71.09 per share. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan) Under the 1991 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options which qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (ISOs) and non qualified stock options (NQOs), up to a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. ISOs may be granted only to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries and NQOs may be granted to employees, consultants and directors who are also employees of Teradyne. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 200,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted options to purchase, in the aggregate, more than 300,000 shares of common stock under the 1991 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1991 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an option whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the option, its exercise price and other pertinent terms, including vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each option may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees option may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1991 Plan is a shareholder approved fixed accounting plan which expires in 2011. The 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) Under the 1997 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue ISOs to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries, and NQOs, stock awards and authorizations to purchase Teradyne common stock to employees, consultants or directors (provided that no options may be granted to non employee directors) up to a maximum of 53,000,000 shares. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 400,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted an option to acquire more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1997 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an award, the pertinent terms of such award, including, if such award is an option, whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the award, its exercise price and vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each award may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees award may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1997 Plan is a fixed accounting plan which expires in 2007. Options granted prior to September 2001 under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of five years. Beginning in September 2001, options granted under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of seven years. In addition, Teradyne made a one time grant to all employees under the 1991 and 1997 Plans that vests over two years and has a term of seven years. 35 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 1996 Plan) Each non employee director of Teradyne is entitled to participate in the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options to purchase up to a maximum of 1,600,000 shares of common stock. The 1996 Plan currently provides for the automatic grant (i) on the date of election, of an option to purchase 25,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each non employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors on or after January 1, 2004 (Initial Grant), (ii) on the first Monday in February in each year, beginning in 2004 and continuing throughout the Plan, of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to each existing non employee Director (Annual Grant); and (iii) on the first Monday in February in each year, beginning in 2005 and continuing throughout the Plan, of an option to purchase 30,000 shares of Teradyne common stock to the non employee Chairman of the Board of Directors (Chair) in lieu of the Annual Grant (Annual Chair Grant). The 1996 Plan was amended on January 24, 2005 to increase the automatic grant to a non employee Chair from 15,000 to 30,000 shares of Teradyne common stock. Options granted under the 1996 Plan must be NQOs, shall be granted at 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to January 2002 expire five years following the date of grant and options granted thereafter expire seven years following the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to February 5, 2001 become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year and options granted on or after February 5, 2001 are immediately exercisable. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1996 Plan. Generally, if an optionee ceases to be a director of Teradyne other than by reason of death, no further installments of his or her options become exercisable and the options terminate after three months. However, under certain circumstances, unless a board member becomes a director of a competitor of Teradyne, if the board member goes into government service or retires from the Board of Directors, such option may be exercised within its original terms. The 1996 Plan is a shareholder approved fixed accounting plan which expires in 2006. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments (EITF 03 1), but, in September 2004, delayed the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03 1. For reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, only the disclosure requirements for available for sale securities and cost method investments are required. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). In interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, SFAS 123R would eliminate the ability to account for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value based method under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to calculate equity based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. Under SFAS 123R, public companies are allowed to select from three alternative transition methods: the Modified Prospective Application, which allows for the adoption of SFAS 123R without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption; the Modified Prospective Application with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption; and the Modified Retrospective Application which allows companies to restate prior financial statements. Teradyne expects to adopt SFAS 123R beginning in the third quarter of 2005, as required, using the Modified Prospective method, and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of SFAS 123R . Currently, Teradyne discloses pro forma net income (loss) and related pro forma net income (loss) per share in accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148. Under SFAS 123R, equity based compensation expense is required to be recognized in companies financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, had SFAS 123R been effective, Teradyne would have recognized additional non cash equity based compensation expense of $91.8 million, $85.1 million, and $110.3 million, respectively, applying the provisions of SFAS 123. Teradyne is considering accelerating the vesting of certain outstanding unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under Teradynes various stock option plans. In addition, Teradyne is considering the use of other equity compensation vehicles including the use of restricted stock. 36 In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 modifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs, and the manner in which companies allocate fixed overhead expenses to inventory. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Teradyne does not expect SFAS 151 to have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results From time to time, information we provide, statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including this Form 10 K) contain statements that are not purely historical, but are forward looking statements, made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, forward looking statements made herein include projections, plans and objectives for our business, financial condition, operating results, future operations, or future economic performance, statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements, capital expenditures, expectations as to customer orders and demand for our products and statements relating to backlog, bookings and cancellations, gross margins and pricing considerations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, which could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. These factors, and others, are discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Business Is Impacted by Worldwide Economic Cycles, Which Are Difficult to Predict. Capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries, such as Teradyne, have, in the past, been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies, and resulting reductions in customer capital investments. Future slowdowns in global economies and reductions in customer capital investments, which may adversely impact our business, are difficult to predict. Acts of War, Terrorists Attacks and the Threat of Domestic and International Terrorist Attacks May Adversely Impact Our Business. Acts of war and terrorists attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, customers, suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. As we sell and manufacture products both in the United States and internationally, the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business. Such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems. All of these conditions make it difficult for us, and our customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Business is Dependent on the Current and Anticipated Market for Electronics, Which Historically Have Been Highly Cyclical. Our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. The market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns and the effects of hostile acts. Historically, the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply, which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment, including systems we manufacture and market. We believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations. We are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters. In addition, any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 37 We Have Taken Measures to Address the Slowdown in the Market for Our Products Which Could Have Long term Negative Effects on Our Business. During 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, we took measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products. In particular, we reduced our workforce, closed and or sold facilities, discontinued certain product lines, implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced planned capital expenditures and expense budgets. Each measure we took to address such slowdowns could have long term negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, increasing our debt, and making it more difficult to respond to customers or competitors, as the market and customer orders turn around. We May Not Be Able to Adequately Address a Rapid Increase in Customer Demand. Because we took measures in recent years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services, we may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand. Our ability to meet rapid increases in customer demand is also, to a certain extent, dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements, over which we have little or no control. Our Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Acquisitions Which May Affect Our Ability to Manage and Maintain Our Business. Since our inception, we have acquired a number of businesses. In the future, we may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement our existing operations. Such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; the costs associated with and or the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into our culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; the inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of an acquired business; the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business; the possibility that our reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business; potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business, including but not limited to regulatory, environmental and tax liabilities; significant underperformance of the acquired business relative to our expectations; the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles, which may adversely affect our reported results of operations; and litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions. For example, in connection with the August 2000 acquisition of each of Herco Technology Corp., a California company, and Perception Laminates, Inc., a California company, a complaint was filed on or about September 5, 2001 and is now pending in Federal District Court, San Diego, California, by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants Teradyne and two of our executive officers. This case is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. Additionally, in 2001, we were designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a clean up site in Los Angeles, California. This claim arises out of our acquisition of Perception Laminates, Inc. in August 2000. Prior to that date, Perception Laminates had itself acquired certain assets of Alco Industries Inc. under an asset purchase agreement dated July 30, 1992. This matter is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. 38 We Currently Are and in the Future May Be Subject to Litigation that Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. From time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. For example, on April 30, 2004, Hampshire Equity Partners II, L.P. (HEP), filed a complaint against Teradyne and Teradyne Connection Systems segment (TCS) asserting fraud and negligence based claims, and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity. In the complaint, HEP alleges that it relied upon statements made by a representative of TCS to a HEP agent during its due diligence prior to investing $55 million in Connector Services Corporation, aka AMAX Plating, Inc (CSC). HEP seeks to hold Teradyne and TCS responsible for its decision to invest in CSC and for the losses it has suffered upon the bankruptcy of CSC. HEP seeks damages in an unstated amount exceeding $55 million. The case is currently pending in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. Management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. This case is further described in Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. Our Business May be Adversely Impacted by Divestitures of Lines of Business Which May Affect Our Ability to Manage and Maintain Our Business. Since our inception, we have divested certain lines of business. In the future, we may undertake additional such divestitures. Such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel; disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on our culture, product and service delivery methodology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies; customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business; restructuring, inventory and other charges which may affect our results of operations; and the decreased diversification of our product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make our operating results subject to increased market fluctuations. If We Are Unable to Protect Our Intellectual Property, We May Lose a Valuable Asset or May Incur Costly Litigation to Protect Our Rights. Our products incorporate technology that we protect in several ways, including patents, copyrights, trade secrets and by contract (IP). However, even with these protections, our IP may still be challenged, invalidated or subject to other infringement actions. While we believe that our IP has value in the aggregate, no single element of our IP is in itself essential. If a significant portion of our IP is invalidated or ineffective, our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against us, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products, or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results. If We Fail to Develop New Technologies to Adapt to Our Customers Needs and if Our Customers Fail to Accept Our New Products, Our Revenues Will Be Adversely Affected. We believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers. In a rapidly evolving market, such as ours, the development of new technologies, 39 commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success. Successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors, including: new product selection; ability to meet customer requirements; development of competitive products by competitors; timely and efficient completion of product design; timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing; and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations. We Are Subject to Intense Competition. We face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. We also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers. Some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products. Moreover, increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We Are Subject to Risks of Operating Internationally. A significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the United States. Our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including: unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; changes in tariffs and exchange rates; social, political and economic instability, acts of terrorism and international conflicts; difficulties in accounts receivable collection; cultural differences in the conduct of business; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; potentially adverse tax consequences; and compliance with customs regulations. In addition, an increasingly large portion of our products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations, including China, and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in Taiwan, Singapore, China and other parts of Asia. As a result, we are subject to a number of economic and other risks, particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions. Disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business. Our Business May Suffer if We Are Unable to Attract and Retain Key Employees. Competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees. The loss of one or more key or other employees, our inability to attract additional qualified employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 40 If Our Suppliers do not Meet Product or Delivery Requirements, We Could Have Reduced Revenues and Earnings. Certain components, including semiconductor chips, may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. Approximately 30% of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive. If any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products, and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom we do not exercise any control. We are also dependent on the financial strength of our suppliers and may be subject to litigation arising from our relationships with suppliers and others. There can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Incur Significant Liabilities if We Fail to Comply With Environmental Regulations. We are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. If we fail to comply with present and future regulations, or are required to perform site remediation, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also: restrict our ability to expand facilities; require us to acquire costly equipment; or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses. Pursuant to present regulations and agreements, we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2004, we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire sites. On January 27, 2003, the European Union adopted the following directives: (i) the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the RoHS Directive); and (ii) the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the WEEE Directive). Both the RoHs Directive and the WEEE Directive will alter the type and manner in which electronic equipment is imported, sold and handled in the European Union. Ensuring compliance with the RoHs Directive and the WEEE Directive and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus, could have a negative impact on the business, operations and financial condition. The RoHs Directive and the WEEE Directive will be become effective on July 6, 2006 and August 13, 2005, respectively. We Have Substantially Increased Our Indebtedness. On October 24, 2001, we completed a private placement of $400 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due October 15, 2006 and received net proceeds of $389 million. As a result, we have incurred approximately $400 million principal amount of additional indebtedness, substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization. The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult to make payments on our debt and other obligations; 41 make it difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service for indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; place us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. During the year ended December 31, 2004, and in the first quarter of 2005, Teradyne took steps to reduce its indebtedness, including repurchasing a total of $28.5 million of the Notes on the open market pursuant to the Board of Directors authorization given to management to repurchase up to $100 million of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 101.50. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations, including our obligations under the Notes. We May Not Be Able to Satisfy Certain Obligations in the Event of a Change in Control. The indenture governing the Notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of Teradyne. If a change in control occurs, the holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of the Notes not previously called for redemption. The price that we are required to pay is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, together with interest accrued but unpaid to, but excluding, the repurchase date. At our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, instead of paying the repurchase price in cash, we may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at 95% of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date. If we are required to repurchase the Notes, there is no guarantee that we will have enough funds to pay such amounts. As a result, a change in control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Not Be Able to Pay Our Debt and Other Obligations. If our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes or certain of our other obligations, we would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the Notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations. Moreover, we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes at maturity. We May Need Additional Financing, Which Could Be Difficult to Obtain. We expect that our existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. However, we have a finite amount of cash and in the event we may need to raise additional funds, due to losses or other reasons, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. Further, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Future financings may place restrictions on how we operate our business. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures, which could seriously harm our business. 42 We Will Be Required to Account for Options Under Our Employee Stock Plans as a Compensation Expense, Which Will Adversely Affect Our Operating Results There has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options. We currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 123R or any other future laws and regulations requiring us to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations will adversely affect operating results. Note B: Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share if it had been in effect during the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are additional stock based compensation disclosures. Provisions of Our Charter and By Laws and Massachusetts Law Make a Takeover of Teradyne More Difficult. Our basic corporate documents, our stockholder rights plan and Massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders. Our Operating Results Are Likely to Fluctuate Significantly. Our annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability. The following factors set out below are expected to impact future operations: competitive pressures on selling prices; our ability to introduce and the market acceptance of new products planned for 2005 and beyond; changes in product revenue mix resulting from changes in customer demand; the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter resulting from the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and constraints occurring at the end of a quarter, or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business; engineering and development investments relating to new product introductions in 2005 and beyond, and the expansion of manufacturing and engineering operations in Asia; the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, especially if product demand increases rapidly; provisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products; and impairment charges for certain long lived assets. In particular, due to the introduction of a number of new, complex test systems in 2003 and 2004 and the planned introduction of other systems in 2005 and beyond, there can be no assurance that we will not experience delays in shipment of our products or that our products will achieve customer acceptance. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 43 We have Significant Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations From time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products, guarantee certain indebtedness obligations of our subsidiary companies and have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers, directors, employees and agents, to the extent permitted by law, arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer, director, employee or agent, is or was serving at our request in such capacity. If we become liable under any of these obligations, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. For additional information regarding Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations see Part I, Note J: Commitments and Contingencies in this Form 10 K. In addition to the guarantee and indemnification obligations set forth in this 10 K, Teradyne occasionally guarantees the performance obligations and responsibilities of its subsidiary and affiliate companies. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in European and Japanese currencies. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management Teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. Debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Since the Notes were out of the money at year end, they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On these bases, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $0.9 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 44
