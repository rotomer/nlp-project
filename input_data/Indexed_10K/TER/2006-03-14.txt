Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of Teradynes plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Teradynes actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the guidance provided by the Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to Teradynes customers upon shipment. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, Teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur. For equipment that includes software that is incidental to the product, revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require Teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, Teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable 21 and substantially in the control of Teradyne. Teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Teradynes post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. Teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and Teradyne defers revenue in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 90 1. Teradynes products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. Teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. Teradyne does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions (SOP 97 2). Teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Equity Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans For periods prior to 2006, Teradyne accounts for its equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations (APB 25). Teradynes employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan. Teradynes equity incentive plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value 22 method under the provisions of APB 25. Accordingly, there has been $0.8 million of expense in 2005 related to restricted stock units. Teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123), as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (SFAS 148). See Note B: Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information. Teradyne implemented the expense recognition provisions of the FASBs new standard, SFAS 123R, beginning with the first quarter of its 2006 fiscal year that began on January 1, 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, had SFAS 123R been effective, Teradyne would have recognized additional non cash equity based compensation expense in continuing operations of $90.3 million, $82.7 million, and $76.8 million, respectively, applying the provisions of SFAS 123. On May 26, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding, unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under Teradynes various stock option plans. The stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of $13.26, the closing price of Teradynes common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005 and ranged in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. As a result of the vesting acceleration, options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately and Teradyne reduced the compensation expense it otherwise would have been required to record under SFAS 123R by approximately $48.6 million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, Teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions, most notably the United States. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at December 31, 2004 and 2005. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists, including sustained profitability, that realization is more likely than not. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets Teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors Teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of Teradynes use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When Teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, Teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. Teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. 23 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Percentage of net revenue: Net Revenue: Products 80.1 % 83.2 % 76.2 % Service 19.9 16.8 23.8 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of products 47.3 42.3 48.1 Cost of service 14.4 10.8 14.5 Total cost of revenue 61.7 53.1 62.6 Gross profit 38.3 46.9 37.4 Operating Expenses: Engineering and development 20.8 17.8 24.5 Selling and administrative 23.5 18.0 23.9 Restructuring and other charges 1.6 0.1 4.4 Total Operating Expenses 45.9 35.9 52.8 Net interest and other (expense) income 0.2 (1.0 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes (7.4 ) 11.0 (16.4 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes (1.8 ) 1.6 0.7 (Loss) income from continuing operations (5.6 )% 9.4 % (17.1 )% Results of Operations Discontinued Operations On October 10, 2005, Teradyne announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to sell its Connection Systems segment to Amphenol Corporation for $390.0 million in cash (subject to a post closing net asset value adjustment). On November 30, 2005 the sale was completed for an adjusted purchase price of $384.7 million. Connection Systems had revenues for the eleven month period ended November 30, 2005 of $331.0 million and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $381.7 million and $357.2 million, respectively. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2005 was $14.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $32.6 million. Net loss of the discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $24.0 million. In 2005, Teradyne recorded a gain on the sale of Connection Systems of $137.0 million, net of a tax provision of $31.0 million. In accordance with SFAS 144, we are reporting Connection Systems as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless indicated otherwise, the discussion and amounts provided in this Results of Operations section and elsewhere in this Form 10 K relate to continuing operations only. 24 Bookings Teradynes net orders for its three reportable segments for 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Percent Change 2003 2004 Percent Change (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 880.4 $ 1,036.4 $ 837.9 (15 )% 24 % Assembly Test Systems 161.4 162.1 156.6 4 Other Test Systems 128.8 107.6 105.9 20 2 $ 1,170.6 $ 1,306.1 $ 1,100.4 (10 )% 19 % The 15% decrease in Semiconductor Test Systems bookings from 2004 to 2005 was driven by less demand from our Subcon customers, primarily in the first half of 2005 as they experienced lower capacity utilization. The second half of 2005 showed a 50% increase over the first half, however, with a surge in demand in the automotive disk storage, game processors, performance consumer and wireless markets. Although total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings declined from 2004 to 2005, FLEX bookings increased over 100% during this period. Orders in the Assembly Test Systems segment were flat from 2004 to 2005. Orders in the Assembly Test Systems segment increased from 2003 to 2004, primarily due to the net increases in the Mil/Aero business and increased orders of in circuit products. The growth in these areas was offset by a decline in orders resulting from the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines in 2003. The Other Test Systems bookings increase from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to a large project booked in the second half of 2005 by a major customer in our Diagnostic Solutions business. Other Test Systems bookings are program related and can have significant fluctuations from period to period. Teradynes order cancellations and backlog adjustments for its three reportable segments for the last three years are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 15.2 $ 10.5 $ 6.9 Assembly Test Systems 0.2 2.5 Other Test Systems $ 15.2 $ 10.7 $ 9.4 Semiconductor Test Systems experienced $15.2 million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in 2005. Approximately 70% of this amount was related to cancellations, while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to managements estimate of what may be canceled in future periods. Teradynes net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 United States 25 % 23 % 27 % South East Asia 24 20 18 Europe 17 17 17 Singapore 13 14 14 Taiwan 10 19 13 Japan 9 6 10 Rest of the World 2 1 1 100 % 100 % 100 % 25 For the past three years, Teradynes backlog of unfilled orders for its three reportable segments is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 289.7 $ 224.1 $ 333.7 Assembly Test Systems 70.1 63.8 56.1 Other Test Systems 62.4 38.8 40.7 $ 422.2 $ 326.7 $ 430.5 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2005, 2004, and 2003 there were no significant cancellation penalties received. Due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Revenue Teradynes net revenue for its three reportable segments for 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Percent Change 2003 2004 Percent Change (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 814.2 $ 1,146.3 $ 735.4 (29 )% 56 % Assembly Test Systems 155.1 155.2 151.6 2 Other Test Systems 105.9 108.7 108.7 (3 ) $ 1,075.2 $ 1,410.2 $ 995.7 (24 )% 42 % The reduction in bookings at our Subcon customers in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment in the second half of 2004 drove the decrease in revenue in the first half of 2005. The bookings reduction was primarily the result of lower utilization of Teradyne testers at our Subcon customers. The second half of 2005 showed sales only slightly lower than comparable 2004 levels. Assembly Test Systems sales and Other Test System sales were flat from 2004 to 2005. The increase in Assembly Test Systems sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to increases in both the commercial and Mil/Aero businesses. Commercial business growth was due to increased sales of in circuit test products, while the increase in Mil/Aero sales was generated by a number of large projects which were undertaken in 2004. These increases were offset, in part, by decreases from the sale of the manual x ray, rework and Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) product lines in 2003. Teradynes three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2005 2004 2003 Semiconductor Test Systems 76 % 81 % 74 % Assembly Test Systems 14 11 15 Other Test Systems 10 8 11 100 % 100 % 100 % 26 Teradynes net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 South East Asia 24 % 20 % 19 % United States 22 21 27 Europe 17 16 16 Singapore 13 16 14 Taiwan 12 19 12 Japan 9 6 11 Rest of the World 3 2 1 100 % 100 % 100 % Teradynes product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Percent Change 2003 2004 Percent Change (in millions except percent change) Product Revenue $ 861.6 $ 1,173.2 $ 758.7 (27 )% 55 % Service Revenue 213.6 237.0 237.0 (10 ) $ 1,075.2 $ 1,410.2 $ 995.7 (24 )% 42 % Service revenue is derived from the servicing of Teradynes installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2005, 2004, and 2003, Teradynes three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 18%, 21% and 17% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Gross Margin 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Point Change 2003 2004 Point Change (dollars in millions) Gross Margin $ 411.8 $ 660.9 $ 372.5 Percent of Total Revenue 38.3 % 46.9 % 37.4 % (8.6 ) 9.5 The decrease in gross margin from 2004 to 2005 was the result of several factors. A reduction in Semiconductor Test Systems sales volume contributed 4 points; a $38.5 million inventory provision recorded in Semiconductor Test Systems for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory contributed 3.5 points; and a shift in product mix within Semiconductor Test contributed 1.5 points. These decreases were offset in part by lower variable employee compensation which contributed 1 point. The gross margin improvement of 9.5 points from 2003 to 2004 was a result of several factors. An improvement of 6 points is due to a volume increase from year to year, coupled with lower fixed manufacturing costs, primarily resulting from past restructuring actions. An additional 5 points can be attributed to a more favorable mix of revenues, with higher margin configurations as well as more product revenue, as product margins are higher than service margins. Higher variable compensation expense in 2004 had a 1.5 point unfavorable impact on margins year over year. 27 The breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Point Change 2003 2004 Point Change (dollars in millions) Product Gross Margin $ 352.7 $ 576.0 $ 280.0 Percent of Product Revenue 40.9 % 49.1 % 36.9 % (8.2 ) 12.2 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Point Change 2003 2004 Point Change (dollars in millions) Service Gross Margin $ 59.1 $ 84.9 $ 92.5 Percent of Service Revenue 27.7 % 35.8 % 39.0 % (8.1 ) (3.2 ) We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. These write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components. Sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision, which is recorded in cost of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2005, Teradyne recorded inventory provisions of $49.3 million in cost of revenues of which $36.9 million was for excess inventory and $12.4 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $49.3 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $45.5 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems (including a $38.5 million provision for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory), $2.9 million related to Assembly Test Systems and $0.8 million related to Other Test Systems. During the year ended December 31, 2004, Teradyne recorded inventory provisions of $9.7 million in cost of revenues of which $3.5 million was for excess inventory and $6.2 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $9.7 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $6.2 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems, $3.0 million related to Assembly Test Systems and $0.5 million related to Other Test Systems. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Teradyne recorded inventory provisions of $15.0 million in cost of which $5.8 million was for excess inventory and $9.2 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $15.0 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $9.3 million related to Assembly Test Systems, which included $3.6 million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing, distributing and primary support of the AOI product line, $5.2 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems SOC parts and components and $0.5 million related to Other Test Systems. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Teradyne sold inventory that was previously reserved which had a favorable gross margin impact of $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Teradyne scrapped $34.3 million, $42.1 million, and $24.6 million of inventory which had been previously written down or written off during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, Teradyne had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of $158.4 million and $144.9 million, respectively. Of the reserves at December 31, 2005, $48.9 million, $7.0 million, $10.0 million, and $92.5 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2005, 2004, 2003, and prior to 2003, respectively. 28 Engineering and Development 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Change 2003 2004 Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 223.0 $ 250.0 $ 244.2 $ (27.0 ) $ 5.8 Percent of Total Revenue 20.8 % 17.8 % 24.5 % During 2005, Teradyne reduced its levels of investment in engineering and development spending. More than 85% of Teradynes total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between $150 and $250 million. During 2005, Semiconductor Test Systems completed its UltraFLEX platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its FLEX Test Platform (UltraFLEX and FLEX) which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures. During 2003 and 2004, Semiconductor Test Systems reduced the number of platforms under major development, which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms. The consolidation of multiple product divisions within Semiconductor Test Systems into one group in 2001 enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation. The decrease of $27 million in engineering and development spending from 2004 to 2005 consists of the following amounts: $21 million decrease due to the completion of the FLEX Test Platform engineering work; $4 million decrease due to variable employee compensation; and $2 million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending. The increase of $6 million in engineering and development spending from 2003 to 2004 consisted of the following amounts: $10 million increase due to the development of the FLEX Test Platform; $6 million increase due to variable employee compensation; and $1 million increase in travel and training costs; These increases were offset in part by the following: $6 million decrease in salaries and fringe benefits due to a decrease in headcount, offset in part by salary increases effective July 1, 2004; and $5 million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending, including a decrease of $2 million in accelerated depreciation related to asset writedowns and facility closures in 2003. Selling and Administrative 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Change 2003 2004 Change (dollars in millions) Selling and Administrative $ 252.8 $ 254.4 $ 238.0 $ (1.6 ) $ 16.4 Percent of Total Revenue 23.5 % 18.0 % 23.9 % The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $1.6 million from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily to an $8.7 million decrease in variable compensation, offset by a $5.5 million increase in sales support spending for the FLEX platform and a $1.6 million increase in salaries and fringe benefits due to salary increases. 29 The increase in spending of $16.4 million from 2003 to 2004 was principally due to the following approximate amounts: $14 million increase due to variable employee compensation; $5 million from an increase in consulting expenses; and $4 million increase in travel and training costs; These increases were offset in part by the following: $6 million in lower depreciation costs due to asset writedowns and capital spending cutbacks; and $2 million decrease in rental and lease payments due to consolidation of facilities. Restructuring and Other Charges In response to a downturn in the industry, Teradyne initiated restructuring activities in 2002 across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations. Further actions were initiated in 2003, to a lesser extent in 2004, and in 2005. The tables below represent activity related to these actions. The remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employee compensation and withholdings. The remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. Teradyne expects to pay out approximately $5.0 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Teradynes future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $10.7 million as of December 31, 2005. Teradyne has subleased approximately 48% of its unoccupied space as of December 31, 2005 and is actively attempting to sublease the remaining space. 2005 Activities Severance and Benefits Gain on Sale of Land and Buildings Long Lived Asset Impairment Facility Related Other Charges Total (in thousands) 2005 provision (gain) $ 21,254 $ (15,329 ) $ 8,331 $ 2,276 $ 4,247 $ 20,779 Cash (payments) receipts (11,439 ) 15,329 (546 ) (3,718 ) (374 ) Asset write downs (8,331 ) (8,331 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 9,815 $ $ $ 1,730 $ 529 $ 12,074 During the year ended December 31, 2005, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to the 2005 restructuring activities: $21.3 million for severance and related benefits for 526 people terminated across all segments. $15.3 million in gains, including $13.2 million in Semiconductor Test Systems for the sale of land in Japan and a building in Agoura Hills, CA, and $2.1 million at Corporate for the sale of a building in North Reading, MA. $8.3 million charge, for certain long lived assets held for sale, as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets primarily related to a building held for sale in North Reading, MA, at Corporate which was subsequently sold. $2.3 million charge related to the exit of an Assembly Test Systems facility in Poway, CA. $4.2 million charge consisting of $3.1 million of divestiture related fees at Corporate and $1.1 million for a lease obligation for unused software licenses in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment. 30 2004 Activities Severance and Benefits Long Lived Asset Impairment Facility Related Total (in thousands) 2004 provision $ 3,296 $ 650 $ 448 $ 4,394 Cash payments (1,584 ) (21 ) (1,605 ) Asset write downs (650 ) (650 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 1,712 $ $ 427 $ 2,139 2005 provision 308 308 Cash payments (1,611 ) (79 ) (1,690 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 101 $ $ 656 $ 757 During the year ended December 31, 2004 and subsequently, Teradyne recorded the following activity related to the 2004 restructuring activities: $3.3 million for severance and related benefits for 140 people terminated across all segments and in all functional areas. $0.7 million for long lived assets impaired in an Assembly Test Systems facility in Westford, MA as a result of exiting the facility. $0.4 million in 2004 and an additional $0.3 million in 2005 related to the lease obligations of a vacated Assembly Test Systems facility in Westford, MA. 2003 Activities Severance and Benefits Long Lived Asset Impairment Loss on Sale of Product Lines Total (in thousands) 2003 provision $ 18,445 $ 7,495 $ 9,239 $ 35,179 Cash (payments) receipts (11,473 ) 1,215 (10,258 ) Asset write downs (7,495 ) (10,454 ) (17,949 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 6,972 6,972 2004 reversal (1,705 ) (1,875 ) (3,580 ) Cash (payments) receipts (4,900 ) 2,755 (2,145 ) Asset write downs (880 ) (880 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 367 367 2005 reversal (4,068 ) (4,068 ) Cash (payments) receipts (167 ) 4,068 3,901 Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 200 $ $ $ 200 During the year ended December 31, 2003 and subsequently, Teradyne recorded the following related to the 2003 restructuring activities: $18.4 million charge in 2003 for severance and related benefits for 605 people terminated across all segments and in all functional areas, and a reversal of $1.7 million in 2004. $9.2 million of charges related to product line divestures in Assembly Test System in 2003, $1.0 million in reversals in 2004 from earnout payments received from the product line divestitures, and $4.1 million in reversals in 2005 from earnout payments received from divestitures. 31 $7.5 million of long lived asset impairment charges consisting of $4.0 million in Assembly Test Systems primarily related to the impairment of manufacturing equipment and $3.5 million in Semiconductor Test Systems related to a reduction in the fair value of properties held for sale in Agoura Hills, CA.

Interest Income and Expense 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Change 2003 2004 Change (in millions) Interest income $ 17.8 $ 15.4 $ 14.0 $ 2.4 $ 1.4 Interest expense $ (16.2 ) $ (18.8 ) $ (20.9 ) $ (2.6 ) $ (2.1 ) The increase in interest income from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates. The increase in interest income from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to an increase in interest rates in the latter half of 2004 and increased cash balances throughout 2004. The decrease in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to the repurchase of $20 million and $71.5 million of Teradynes 3.75% Senior Convertible Notes (the Notes) in the first and fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. The decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 was primarily attributable to the prepayment of Teradynes California mortgage of $42.3 million in the third quarter of 2003 which reduced interest expense for 32 the fourth quarter of 2003 and all of 2004, as well as the repurchase of $8.5 million of the Notes in the third quarter of 2004. Other Income and Expense, Net Other income and expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 includes the following: Income (expense) 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Gain on sale of investment (1) $ $ 2,584 $ 2,800 Collection of loan (2) 585 Other than temporary impairment of common stock investment (267 ) Fair value adjustment on warrants (366 ) 138 Mortgage prepayment penalty (3) (3,220 ) Other than temporary impairment of investment (2,592 ) Total $ $ 2,536 $ (2,874 ) (1) Gain on sale of an investment in common stock. (2) The loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection. (3) Penalties related to prepayment of a $42.3 million mortgage loan collateralized against certain California real estate properties, which was to mature on January 1, 2007. (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005 Change 2003 2004 Change (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ (78.6 ) $ 189.2 $ (69.3 ) $ (267.8 ) $ 258.5 Assembly Test Systems 10.3 (1.7 ) (75.5 ) 12.0 73.8 Other Test Systems 10.0 6.1 1.7 3.9 4.4 Corporate (21.8 ) (39.1 ) (20.0 ) 17.3 (19.1 ) Total $ (80.1 ) $ 154.5 $ (163.1 ) $ (234.6 ) $ 317.6 The change to a loss position from 2004 to 2005 was mainly attributable to decreased sales in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment. The change to an income position from a loss position from 2003 to 2004 was mainly attributable to increased sales in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, as well as continued cost reductions throughout Teradyne. Income Taxes During 2005, the income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $19.7 million. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), a benefit of $29.2 million was recognized for losses related to current year continuing operations, as a result of the sale of Connection Systems. There was an equal and offsetting tax provision in the gain on sale of Connection Systems included in discontinued operations. The remaining portion of the net tax benefit includes a tax provision of $9.5 million that related primarily to foreign taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes. Tax expense for 2004 also included an IRS settlement related to the closing out of tax years 1999 through 2001. During 2004, Teradyne utilized previously reserved net operating losses to reduce taxable income 33 and lower the effective tax rate. Teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in 2003. Until sufficient positive evidence exists, including an appropriate level of profitability, Teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, Teradyne maintained its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists, including sustained profitability, that realization is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2005, Teradyne had $617.8 million of U.S. Federal Operating Loss Carryforwards. The effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were (24.6)%, 14.1% and 4.2%, respectively.

Cash activity for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 2004 2005Change 2003 2004Change Cash provided by (used for) operating activities: Net (loss) income from continuing operations, adjusted for non cash items $ 37.2 $ 241.6 $ (21.0 ) $ (204.4 ) $ 262.6 Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired (53.8 ) (23.7 ) 33.3 (30.1 ) (57.0 ) Cash provided by discontinued operations 30.9 36.9 21.9 (6.0 ) 15.0 Total cash provided by operating activities $ 14.3 $ 254.8 $ 34.2 $ (240.5 ) $ 220.6 Cash used for investing activities for continuing operations (185.2 ) (283.1 ) (120.2 ) 97.9 (162.9 ) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations 366.4 (9.8 ) 5.8 376.2 (15.6 ) Total cash provided by (used for) investing activities $ 181.2 $ (292.9 ) $ (114.4 ) $ 474.1 $ (178.5 ) Cash (used for) provided by financing activities from continuing operations (63.9 ) 18.8 57.1 (82.7 ) (38.3 ) Cash (used for) provided by financing activities from discontinued operations Total cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (63.9 ) $ 18.8 $ 57.1 $ (82.7 ) $ (38.3 ) Total $ 131.6 $ (19.3 ) $ (23.1 ) $ 150.9 $ 3.8 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, used cash of $53.8 million in 2005 as accounts receivable balances increased $63.0 million primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding, based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues, from 55 days in 2004 to 61 days in 2005, and accounts payable, deferred revenue and accruals decreased by $54.4 million, which includes contributions to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan of approximately $35.0 million. The uses of cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by a decrease of $70.5 million in inventory. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $23.7 million in 2004 primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable, deferred revenue and accrual balances of $37.5 million. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, proceeds from asset disposals, proceeds from the sale of product lines, cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures were $113.5 million in 2005, $154.6 million in 2004 and $69.0 million in 2003. Capital expenditures decreased by $41.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Additions of internally constructed systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment accounted for approximately $20.2 million of the decrease in capital expenditures. Additions of internally constructed systems peaked in 2004, due to the introduction of the FLEX Test Platform. The remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across Teradyne. Capital expenditures increased by $85.5 million in 2004 compared to 2003, due primarily to additions of internally constructed systems to support the introduction of the FLEX Test Platform, and to a lesser extent due to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment to support the increase in revenues in 2004 and continued investment in research and development. Investing activities of the discontinued operation provided $366.4 million of cash in 2005. In November of 2005, Teradyne sold Connection Systems to Amphenol Corporation for net proceeds of $382.7 million. Financing activities include sales of Teradynes common stock, as well as repayments of debt. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, repayments of long term debt used cash of $98.7 million, $11.5 million and $43.4 million, 35 respectively, as Teradyne repurchased a portion of its outstanding Notes in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and the third quarter of 2004, and prepaid its mortgage on its California properties in the third quarter of 2003. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $34.7 million, $30.3 million, and $100.5 million, respectively. On October 24, 2001, Teradyne issued $400 million principal amount of the Notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Teradyne began making annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Teradyne that rank equally with Teradynes existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In the event of a change in control by which Teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party, the holders of the Notes may be able to require Teradyne to redeem some or all of the Notes either in discounted Teradyne common stock or in cash. On February 8, 2002, the Commission declared effective a Registration Statement on Form S 3 covering both the Notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted. On or after October 18, 2004, Teradyne may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below. The redemption price, expressed as a percentage of principal amount, is as follows for the designated periods: Period RedemptionPrice Beginning on October 18, 2004 and ending on October 14, 2005 101.50 % Beginning on October 15, 2005 and ending on October 14, 2006 100.75 % Thereafter, Teradyne may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount. On August 18, 2004, the Board of Directors of Teradyne authorized management to repurchase up to $100 million of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 101.50% of the principal amount. The Board subsequently amended its authorization on October 21, 2005 to authorize repurchases through open market purchases, privately negotiated transaction, auctions, by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by Teradynes CEO or CFO, at prices below 100.75% of the principal amount. The $100 million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of 2004 and the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to repurchase $8.5 million, $20.0 million and $71.5 million of the Notes, respectively. The decision to repurchase a portion of the Notes was based on the fair market value of the Notes being below the return Teradyne would earn on high grade investment securities. As a result of the repurchases, Teradynes interest payments for the Notes in 2006 are expected to be $11.3 million. On January 26, 2006, management was given further authorization by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to the full $300 million of the principal amount that remains outstanding under the Notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Pursuant to the new Board resolutions, on February 16, 2006, Teradyne repurchased $15 million of the Notes. As of February 22, 2006, $285 million of the principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing of when and the amount of the Notes that management may elect to repurchase, including the price of the available Notes, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities, prevailing interest rates, and Teradynes anticipated liquidity needs. If, at some point in the future, Teradynes stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, management may elect to convert a portion of the Notes into equity, to avoid the continuation of interest payments and to conserve capital. However, there can be no assurance that even if Teradynes stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the Notes will convert into equity as Teradynes stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date. If this were to occur, Teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the Notes called into cash. There are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including Teradynes stock price, Teradynes available cash and marketable securities and Teradynes anticipated liquidity needs. 36 Teradyne believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $927.7 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $20.0 million in 2006 to Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan which is currently under funded. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans Teradynes pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was 1.3% of Teradynes cost of revenue and operating expenses. The largest portion of Teradynes 2005 pension expense was $8.0 million for its U.S. Qualified Pension Plan including a curtailment charge of $1.7 million related to the sale of Connection Systems, which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected return on plan assets for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets of 7.5%. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, Teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Teradyne also considered its historical 15 year compounded return of 8.30% for the period ending December 31, 2005, which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Based on these historical returns, Teradyne believes that 7.5% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2005. Teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust these returns as necessary. The current asset allocation for Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 48.4% invested in equity securities and 51.6% invested in fixed income securities, which is in accordance with the plans asset allocation requirements. Teradynes actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2005 was virtually identical to its asset allocation model. Teradynes investment manager regularly reviews Teradynes actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with Teradynes targeted allocations. Teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2005, under the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, Teradyne had cumulative gains of approximately $0.4 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that Teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index (formerly Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index), which was at 5.55% at December 31, 2005, down from 5.68% at December 31, 2004. As a result, Teradyne selected 5.50% for its December 31, 2005 discount rate, which was down from 5.75% as of December 31, 2004. Each year Teradyne considers the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, along with other indices including the Moodys AA rated corporate bond yield and the Citigroup 10+ Year AAA/AA rate. The duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities is approximately 16.5 years, which matches the duration of the Citigroup Pension Liability Index. Teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan will be approximately $5.2 million, $4.3 million and $3.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The pension expense estimates are based on a 5.5% discount rate. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in Teradynes pension plans. Teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2005, if Teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. 37 Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 4.75% 5.75% 6.75% (in millions) 6.50% $ 11.2 $ 8.2 $ 5.3 7.50% 9.3 6.3 3.4 8.50% 7.5 4.4 1.5 Teradynes funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $165.9 million at December 31, 2004 to $208.2 million at December 31, 2005. Teradyne contributions and investment performance returns have decreased the deficit of Teradynes U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $37.9 million at December 31, 2004 to $20.2 million at December 31, 2005. During 2005, Teradyne contributed $35 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Teradyne plans to contribute approximately $20.0 million in 2006 to this plan. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to Teradynes 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note O: Stock Based Compensation, Teradyne maintains three equity compensation plans under which its equity securities are authorized for issuance to Teradynes employees, directors and or consultants. The three plans are: 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan; 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan; and 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan. The purpose of these plans is to promote the interests of Teradyne by attracting and retaining the services of qualified and talented persons to serve as employees, directors and or consultants of Teradyne. Except for the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of the foregoing plans was approved by Teradynes shareholders. The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2005 (share numbers in thousands): Plan category Number of securitiesto be issued uponexercise ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Weighted averageexercise price ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Number of securities remainingavailable for future issuanceunder stock option compensationplans (excluding securitiesreflected in column(1)) Stock option plans approved by shareholders 4,357 $ 19.95 3,869 Stock option plans not approved by shareholders(1) 19,855 20.37 21,854 Total 24,212 $ 20.29 25,723 (1) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), Teradyne assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of Teradynes common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of Teradynes common stock for each share of GenRads common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2005, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 203 shares of Teradynes common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $70.30 per share. 38 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan) Under the 1991 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options which qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (ISOs) and non qualified stock options (NQOs), up to a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of Teradynes common stock. ISOs may be granted only to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries and NQOs may be granted to employees, consultants and directors who are also employees of Teradyne. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 200,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted options to purchase, in the aggregate, more than 300,000 shares of common stock under the 1991 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1991 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an option whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the option, its exercise price and other pertinent terms, including vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each option may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees option may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1991 Plan expires in 2011. The 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) Under the 1997 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue ISOs to employees of Teradyne and its subsidiaries, and NQOs, stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock units) and authorizations to purchase Teradynes common stock to employees, consultants or directors (provided that no options may be granted to non employee directors) up to a maximum of 53,000,000 shares. ISOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and in the case of an employee owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Teradyne, the price per share must be at least 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. No more than 400,000 NQOs may be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value. All other NQOs must be granted at an exercise price of at least 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. No employee may be granted an option to acquire more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Plan during any fiscal year. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1997 Plan and specifies at the time of grant of an award, the pertinent terms of such award, including, if such award is an option, whether such option will be an ISO or NQO, the number of shares subject to the award, its exercise price and vesting provisions. Generally, the term of each award may be for a period not exceeding ten years from the date of grant. Under certain circumstances, if an employee retires from Teradyne, such employees award may expire prior to expiration of its stated term if such employee is engaged by a competitor of Teradyne. The 1997 Plan expires in 2007. Options granted prior to September 2001 under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of five years. Beginning in September 2001, options granted under the 1991 and 1997 Plans vest in equal installments over four years and have a maximum term of seven years. In addition, in 2001 Teradyne made a one time stock options grant to all employees under the 1991 and 1997 Plans that vests over two years and has a term of seven years. In December of 2005, Teradyne issued its first restricted stock unit awards to employees, which vest in equal installments over two years. 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 1996 Plan) Each non employee director of Teradyne is entitled to participate in the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, Teradyne is authorized to issue options to purchase up to a maximum of 1,600,000 shares of common stock. The 1996 Plan currently provides for the automatic grant (i) on the date of election, of an option to purchase 25,000 shares of Teradynes common stock to each non employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors on or after January 1, 2004 (Initial Grant), (ii) on the first Monday in February in each year, beginning in 2004 and continuing throughout the Plan, of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of Teradynes 39 common stock to each existing non employee director (Annual Grant); and (iii) on the first Monday in February in each year, beginning in 2005 and continuing throughout the term of the 1996 Plan, of an option to purchase 30,000 shares of Teradynes common stock to the non employee Chairman of the Board of Directors (Chair) in lieu of the Annual Grant (Annual Chair Grant). The 1996 Plan was amended on January 24, 2005 to increase the automatic grant to a non employee Chair from 15,000 to 30,000 shares of Teradynes common stock. Options granted under the 1996 Plan must be NQOs, shall be granted at 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to January 2002 expire five years following the date of grant and options granted thereafter expire seven years following the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan prior to February 5, 2001 become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year and options granted on or after February 5, 2001 are immediately exercisable. Teradynes Compensation Committee administers the 1996 Plan. Generally, if an optionee ceases to be a director of Teradyne other than by reason of death, no further installments of his or her options become exercisable and the options terminate after three months. The 1996 Plan expires in 2006. Related Party Transactions In January of 2006, Paul Tufano, a member of Teradynes Board of Directors, became Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Solectron Corporation. In the ordinary course of business, Teradyne purchases printed circuit board assemblies from Solectron and sells in circuit testers to Solectron. In the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Teradyne purchased $153.1 million, $141.5 million and $41.3 million of printed circuit board assemblies from Solectron, respectively. Sales of in circuit testers to Solectron for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $5.7 million, $2.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, $7.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively, was included in accounts payable and $1.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, was included in accounts receivable, representing amounts due to/from Solectron. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R. In annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, SFAS 123R would eliminate the ability to account for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value based method under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to record in their Statements of Operations equity based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. Teradyne adopted SFAS 123R beginning in the first quarter of 2006, as required, using the Modified Prospective method, and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of SFAS 123R. Prior to 2006, Teradyne disclosed pro forma net (loss) income and related pro forma net (loss) income per share in accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148. Under SFAS 123R, equity based compensation expense is required to be recognized in companies financial statements. The implementation of SFAS 123R is expected to result in pre tax expense of approximately $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2006, and approximately $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 modifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs, and the manner in which companies allocate fixed overhead expenses to inventory. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Teradyne implemented SFAS 151 beginning in the first quarter of 2006 and it did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, 40 which have minimal credit risk. Teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management Teradyne regularly enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the European Euro, Great Britain Pound, Japanese Yen and the Taiwan Dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce Teradynes risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. Teradyne does not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management Teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. Debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Since the Notes were out of the money at December 31, 2005, they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On these bases, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $1.3 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 41
