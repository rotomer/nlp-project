Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent 18 liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the guidance provided by the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. For equipment that includes software that is incidental to the product, revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, or in the case of new products, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, we defer the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control. We also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Our post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. We defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 90 1. Our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. We classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. We generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions (SOP 97 2). We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) 19 exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. We record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Equity Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provision of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). Stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after January 1, 2006 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of SFAS 123R. As required by SFAS 123R, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest. The cumulative effect of the initial adoption of SFAS 123R was not material. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 (APB 25). In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share based payments for public companies. We have applied provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note B: Accounting Policies and Note O: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation. On May 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding, unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under Teradynes various stock option plans in effect at that time. The stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of $13.26, the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005 and ranged in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. As a result of the vesting acceleration, options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under SFAS 123R by approximately $48.6 million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. 20 Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions, most notably the United States. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, we maintained our valuation allowance at December 31, 2005 and 2006. We do not expect to significantly reduce our valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists, including sustained profitability, that realization is more likely than not. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Percentage of net revenue: Net Revenue: Products 81.7 % 80.1 % 83.2 % Service 18.3 19.9 16.8 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of products 40.3 47.3 42.3 Cost of service 11.7 14.4 10.8 Total cost of revenue 52.0 61.7 53.1 Gross profit 48.0 38.3 46.9 Operating Expenses: Engineering and development 15.2 20.8 17.8 Selling and administrative 21.0 23.5 18.0 Restructuring and other, net (2.5 ) 1.6 0.1 Total operating expenses 33.7 45.9 35.9 Net interest and other income 2.4 0.2 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 16.7 (7.4 ) 11.0 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2.0 (1.8 ) 1.6 Income (loss) from continuing operations 14.7 % (5.6 )% 9.4 % 21 Results of Operations Discontinued Operations On October 10, 2005, we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement to sell our Connection Systems segment to Amphenol Corporation for $390.0 million in cash (subject to a post closing net asset value adjustment). On November 30, 2005 the sale was completed for an adjusted purchase price of $384.7 million. Connection Systems had revenues for the eleven month period ended November 30, 2005 of $331.0 million and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of $381.7 million. Net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $3.9 million, relating to a change in estimate to tax expenses from the sale of Connection Systems. Under applicable accounting guidance, there is an offsetting tax benefit recorded in continuing operations for the same amount. This tax provision results from the finalization of the 2005 U.S. tax return. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2005 was $14.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $32.6 million. In 2005, we recorded a gain on the sale of Connection Systems of $137.0 million, net of a tax provision of $31.0 million. In accordance with SFAS 144, we are reporting Connection Systems as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless indicated otherwise, the discussion and amounts provided in this Results of Operations section and elsewhere in this Form 10 K relate to continuing operations only. Bookings Our net orders for our three reportable segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006PercentChange 2004 2005PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 1,012.6 $ 880.4 $ 1,036.4 15 % (15 )% Assembly Test Systems 175.4 161.4 162.1 9 Other Test Systems 106.4 128.8 107.6 (17 ) 20 $ 1,294.4 $ 1,170.6 $ 1,306.1 11 % (10 )% The Semiconductor Test Systems increase of 15% in orders from 2005 to 2006 was attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets, as customers invested in system on a chip (SOC) test equipment, principally in the first half of 2006. The FLEX family of testers has moved into mainstream production and, along with the J 750 platform, contributed to almost all of the growth experienced. We also saw a customer shift in orders from period to period with subcontractors making up a larger percentage of orders. The 15% decrease in Semiconductor Test Systems bookings from 2004 to 2005 was driven by less demand from our Subcon customers, primarily in the first half of 2005. The second half of 2005 showed a 50% increase over the first half. Although total Semiconductor Test Systems bookings declined from 2004 to 2005, FLEX bookings increased over 100% during this period. The Assembly Test Systems increase of 9% in orders from 2005 to 2006 was primarily driven by demand in the Mil/Aero business due to the cyclical nature of the Mil/Aero program buys. Orders in the Assembly Test Systems segment were flat from 2004 to 2005. The decrease in Other Test Systems orders of 17% from 2005 to 2006 resulted from a decrease in Broadband Test Systems, offset only slightly by an increase in Diagnostic Solutions. The Other Test Systems bookings increase from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to a large project booked in the second half of 2005 by a major customer in our Diagnostic Solutions business. 22 Our order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our three reportable segments for the last three years are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 3.3 $ 15.2 $ 10.5 Assembly Test Systems 0.5 0.2 Other Test Systems 1.6 $ 5.4 $ 15.2 $ 10.7 Semiconductor Test Systems experienced $15.2 million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in 2005. Approximately 70% of this amount was related to cancellations, while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to managements estimate of what may be canceled in future periods. Our net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 United States 28 % 25 % 23 % South East Asia 21 24 20 Europe 15 17 17 Singapore 12 13 14 Japan 12 9 6 Taiwan 11 10 19 Rest of the World 1 2 1 100 % 100 % 100 % For the past three years, our backlog of unfilled orders for our three reportable segments is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 212.4 $ 289.7 $ 224.1 Assembly Test Systems 81.5 70.1 63.8 Other Test Systems 44.9 62.4 38.8 $ 338.8 $ 422.2 $ 326.7 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2006, 2005, and 2004 there were no significant cancellation penalties received. Due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Revenue Our net revenue for our three reportable segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006PercentChange 2004 2005PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Semiconductor Test Systems $ 1,088.9 $ 814.2 $ 1,146.3 34 % (29 )% Assembly Test Systems 164.0 155.1 155.2 6 Other Test Systems 123.9 105.9 108.7 17 (3 ) $ 1,376.8 $ 1,075.2 $ 1,410.2 28 % (24 )% 23 Semiconductor Test Systems revenue increase of 34% from 2005 to 2006 can be attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets, as customers invested in SOC test equipment. Almost the entire increase is in our FLEX family and J750 products and is distributed across all regions. The increase is partially offset by a decrease of certain non FLEX test systems. The reduction in bookings at our Subcon customers in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment in the second half of 2004 drove the decrease in revenue in the first half of 2005. The bookings reduction was primarily the result of lower utilization of our testers at our Subcon customers. The Assembly Test Systems increase of 6% from 2005 to 2006 in revenue was primarily driven by the in circuit commercial test systems market. Revenue in the Assembly Test Systems segment was relatively flat from 2004 to 2005. The increase in Other Test Systems revenue resulted from a strong increase in Diagnostic Solutions sales due primarily to the Vehicle Measurement Module product line, offset by a decrease in Broadband Test Systems sales. Other Test Systems revenue was relatively flat from 2004 to 2005. Our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2006 2005 2004 Semiconductor Test Systems 79 % 76 % 81 % Assembly Test Systems 12 14 11 Other Test Systems 9 10 8 100 % 100 % 100 % Our net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 United States 23 % 22 % 21 % South East Asia 24 24 19 Europe 15 17 16 Taiwan 14 12 19 Japan 12 9 6 Singapore 10 13 16 Rest of the World 2 3 3 100 % 100 % 100 % Our product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006PercentChange 2004 2005PercentChange (in millions except percent change) Product Revenue $ 1,124.6 $ 861.6 $ 1,173.2 31 % (27 )% Service Revenue 252.2 213.6 237.0 18 (10 ) $ 1,376.8 $ 1,075.2 $ 1,410.2 28 % (24 )% Service revenue is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2006, 2005, and 2004, our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 18%, 18% and 21% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. 24 Gross Margin 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006PointChange 2004 2005PointChange (dollars in millions) Gross Margin $ 660.4 $ 411.8 $ 660.9 Percent of Total Revenue 48.0 % 38.3 % 46.9 % 9.7 (8.6 ) The increase in gross margin of approximately 10 points from 2005 to 2006 was the result of several factors. An increase in Semiconductor Test Systems sales volume contributed 4 points; a shift in product mix within Semiconductor Test Systems contributed 2 points; an improvement in service margins, primarily within Semiconductor Test Systems, contributed 2 points; the remaining 2 point increase was due to lower inventory provisions in 2006, as we recorded a $38.5 million charge for non FLEX products in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment in 2005, compared to an $8.0 million charge for non FLEX products in 2006. The decrease in gross margin from 2004 to 2005 was the result of several factors. A reduction in Semiconductor Test Systems sales volume contributed 4 points; a $38.5 million inventory provision recorded in Semiconductor Test Systems for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory contributed 3.5 points; and a shift in product mix within Semiconductor Test contributed 1.5 points. These decreases were offset in part by lower variable employee compensation which contributed 1 point. The breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006PointChange 2004 2005PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Margin $ 569.3 $ 352.7 $ 576.0 Percent of Product Revenue 50.6 % 40.9 % 49.1 % 9.7 (8.2 ) 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006PointChange 2004 2005PointChange (dollars in millions) Service Gross Margin $ 91.1 $ 59.1 $ 84.9 Percent of Service Revenue 36.1 % 27.7 % 35.8 % 8.4 (8.1 ) We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. These write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components. Sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision, which is recorded in cost of revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we sold inventory that was previously reserved which had a favorable gross margin impact of $2.8 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded inventory provisions in cost of revenues of $14.7 million of which $11.7 million was for excess inventory and $3.0 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $14.7 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $11.5 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems (including an $8.0 million provision for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory), $0.7 million related to Assembly Test Division and $2.5 million related to Other Test Systems. 25 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded inventory provisions of $49.3 million in cost of revenues of which $36.9 million was for excess inventory and $12.4 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $49.3 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $45.6 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems (including a $38.5 million provision for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory), $2.9 million related to Assembly Test Systems and $0.8 million related to Other Test Systems. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded inventory provisions of $9.7 million in cost of revenues of which $3.5 million was for excess inventory and $6.2 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $9.7 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $6.2 million related to Semiconductor Test Systems, $3.0 million related to Assembly Test Systems and $0.5 million related to Other Test Systems. We scrapped $30.9 million, $34.3 million, and $42.1 million of inventory which had been previously written down or written off during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We have no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of $139.3 million and $158.4 million, respectively. Of the reserves at December 31, 2006, $13.0 million, $48.8 million, $5.3 million, and $72.2 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2006, 2005, 2004, and prior to 2004, respectively. Engineering and Development 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006Change 2004 2005Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 208.7 $ 223.0 $ 250.0 $ (14.3 ) $ (27.0 ) Percent of Total Revenue 15.2 % 20.8 % 17.8 % During 2006 and 2005, we reduced our levels of investment in engineering and development spending. More than 80% of our total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the Semiconductor Test Systems segment, where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between $150 and $250 million. During 2005, Semiconductor Test Systems completed its UltraFLEX platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its FLEX Test Platform (UltraFLEX and FLEX) which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures. During 2004, Semiconductor Test Systems reduced the number of platforms under major development, which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms. The decrease of $14.3 million in engineering and development spending from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following amounts: $26.1 million decrease due to a reduction in headcount primarily in the U.S., offset partially by an increase in engineering and development in low cost regions; and $6.5 million decrease due to the completion of certain portions of the FLEX Test Platform engineering work. These decreases were partially offset by the following: $10.9 million increase due to higher variable employee compensation; and $7.4 million increase due to stock based compensation. The decrease of $27.0 million in engineering and development spending from 2004 to 2005 consists of the following amounts: $21.6 million decrease due to the completion of certain portions of the FLEX Test Platform engineering work; $3.5 million decrease due to variable employee compensation; and $1.9 million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending. 26 Selling and Administrative 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006Change 2004 2005Change (dollars in millions) Selling and Administrative $ 289.0 $ 252.8 $ 254.4 $ 36.2 $ (1.6 ) Percent of Total Revenue 21.0 % 23.5 % 18.0 % The increase in selling and administrative spending of $36.2 million from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following: $19.7 million increase due to higher variable employee compensation; $14.1 million increase due to transitional expenses, including the consolidation of facilities in Massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions; and $12.0 million increase due to stock based compensation. These increase were partially offset by the following: $8.3 million decrease due to a reduction in headcount; and $1.3 million decrease in foreign exchange expense. The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $1.6 million from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily to an $8.7 million decrease in variable compensation, offset by a $5.5 million increase in sales support spending for the FLEX platform and a $1.6 million increase in salaries and fringe benefits due to salary increases. Restructuring and Other, Net In response to a downturn in the industry, we initiated restructuring activities in 2002 across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations. Further actions were initiated in 2003, to a lesser extent in 2004, 2005 and in 2006. Additionally, in 2005 and 2006, as part of our facility consolidation, we began selling certain real estate. The tables below represent activity related to these actions. The remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet. The remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the other long term accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. We expect to pay out approximately $2.4 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Our future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $12.7 million as of December 31, 2006. We have subleased approximately 15% of our unoccupied space as of December 31, 2006 and are actively attempting to sublease the remaining space. 2006 Activities Gain on Sale of Land and Buildings Severance and Benefits Facility Related Long Lived Asset Impairment Total (in thousands) 2006 (gain) provision $ (39,098 ) $ 6,218 $ 1,153 $ 50 $ (31,677 ) Cash receipts (payments) 39,098 (4,353 ) (528 ) 34,217 Asset write downs (50 ) (50 ) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ $ 1,865 $ 625 $ $ 2,490 27 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded the following activity related to the 2006 restructuring activities: $39.1 million gain on the sale of real estate, including $35.8 million for two Semiconductor Test Systems facilities in Boston, MA, $1.5 million for a Semiconductor Test Systems parking facility in Boston, MA, $1.3 million for a Semiconductor Test Systems facility in San Jose, CA and $0.5 million for buildings in Nashua, NH; $6.2 million of severance charges related to 220 people across all segments; and $1.2 million of facility related charges for the exit of Semiconductor Test Systems facilities in Newbury Park, CA and Waltham, MA.

Interest Income and Expense 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006Change 2004 2005Change (in millions) Interest income $ 44.6 $ 17.8 $ 15.4 $ 26.8 $ 2.4 Interest expense $ (11.1 ) $ (16.2 ) $ (18.8 ) $ 5.1 $ 2.6 The increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributable to higher cash balances primarily from the proceeds received from the divestiture of Connection Systems. The increase in interest income from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates. The decrease in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to the repayment of our 3.75% Senior Convertible Notes (the Notes) in the fourth quarter of 2006 and repurchases made earlier in the year. The decrease in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to the repurchase of $20.0 million and $71.5 million of our Notes in the first and fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. Other Income and Expense, Net Other income and expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 includes the following: Income (expense) 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Gain on sale of investment (1) $ $ $ 2,584 Collection of loan (2) 585 Other than temporary impairment of common stock investment (267 ) Fair value adjustment on warrants (366 ) Total $ $ $ 2,536 (1) Gain on sale of an investment in common stock. (2) The loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection.

The change to a loss position from 2004 to 2005 was mainly attributable to decreased sales in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment. Income Taxes During 2006, the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $27.8 million. The expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes offset by benefits from a $6.0 million credit related to U.S. pension funding and the settlement of a California income tax audit for 1998 through 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2005, there was a tax benefit from continuing operations that totaled $19.7 million. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), a benefit for $29.2 million was recognized for losses relating to 2005 continuing operations, as a result of the sale of Connection Systems. There was an equal and offsetting tax provision in the gain on sale of Connection System in discontinued operations. The remaining portion of the net tax benefit includes a tax provision that related primarily to foreign taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2004, tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes and also included an IRS settlement related to the closing out of tax years 1999 through 2001.

Cash activity for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 2005 2006Change 2004 2005Change Cash provided by operating activities: Net income from continuing operations, adjusted for non cash items $ 281.7 $ 37.2 $ 241.6 $ 244.5 $ (204.4 ) Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired 172.2 (53.8 ) (23.7 ) 226.0 (30.1 ) Cash (used for) provided by discontinued operations (3.9 ) 30.9 36.9 (34.8 ) (6.0 ) Total cash provided by operating activities $ 450.0 $ 14.3 $ 254.8 $ 435.7 $ (240.5 ) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities for continuing operations 196.2 (185.2 ) (283.1 ) 381.4 97.9 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations 366.4 (9.8 ) (366.4 ) 376.2 Total cash provided by (used for) investing activities $ 196.2 $ 181.2 $ (292.9 ) $ 15.0 $ 474.1 Total cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (418.9 ) $ (63.9 ) $ 18.8 $ (355.0 ) $ (82.7 ) Total $ 227.3 $ 131.6 $ (19.3 ) $ 95.7 $ 150.9 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, provided cash of $172.2 million in 2006 primarily due to a decrease of accounts receivable balances of $73.3 million resulting mostly from the decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 and to a lesser extent a decrease in days sales outstanding, based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues, from 61 days in 2005 to 55 days in 2006. Additionally, there was a decrease in inventory of $78.5 million due to shorter final cycle times with our FLEX products, and an increase of $32.8 million in accrued income taxes due to higher foreign taxes in 2006. The increase of cash flow from changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accrued taxes was partially offset by retirement plan contributions of $30.2 million of which $20.0 million was a contribution to our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $53.8 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $63.0 million and retirement plan contributions of $40.1 million, partially offset by a $70.5 million decrease in inventory. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $23.7 million in 2004 primarily due to retirement plan contributions of $38.8 million. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, proceeds from asset disposals, proceeds from the sale of product lines, cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures were $110.4 million in 2006, $113.5 million in 2005 and $154.6 million in 2004. Capital expenditures decreased by $41.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease of internally manufactured systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the Semiconductor Test Systems segment of approximately $20.2 million. Additions of internally manufactured systems peaked in 2004, due to the introduction of the FLEX Test Platform. The remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across Teradyne. Proceeds from asset disposals were $84.6 million and $34.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively and consist of sales of real estate. Investing activities of the discontinued operation provided $366.4 million of cash in 2005. In November of 2005, we sold Connection Systems to Amphenol Corporation for net proceeds of $384.7 million. Financing activities include issuance of our common stock, repurchases of Teradynes common stock as well as repayments of debt. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, repayments of long term debt used cash of $304.6 million, $98.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively. Upon maturity, we paid off the outstanding balance of our 32 outstanding Notes, approximately $261 million aggregate principal, in the fourth quarter of 2006. We repurchased portions of our outstanding Notes in the first and third quarters of 2006, in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and the third quarter of 2004. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $23.3 million, $34.7 million and $30.3 million, respectively. In July 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. Under the program, we may spend up to an aggregate of $400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means through July 2008. Shares are to be repurchased at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. During 2006, we repurchased 10.6 million shares of common stock for $137.6 million for an average price of $12.96. Subsequently, we have repurchased 0.2 million shares of common stock for $2.4 million through February 28, 2007. On October 24, 2001, we issued $400 million principal amount of the Notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. We made annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. On August 18, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $100 million of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 101.50% of the principal amount. The Board subsequently amended its authorization on October 21, 2005 to authorize repurchases through open market purchases, privately negotiated transaction, auctions, by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by our CEO or CFO, at prices below 100.75% of the principal amount. The $100 million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of 2004 and the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to repurchase $8.5 million, $20.0 million and $71.5 million of the Notes, respectively. The decision to repurchase a portion of the Notes was based on the fair market value of the Notes being below the return we would earn on high grade investment securities. On January 26, 2006, management was given further authorization by our Board to repurchase up to the full $300 million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the Notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon. During 2006, we repurchased Notes of $15.0 million in the first quarter, $24.0 million in the third quarter, and we repaid the remaining $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. On February 22, 2007, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with MOSAID Technologies, Inc. of Ottawa, Canada to acquire enabling test technology for a purchase price of $17 million. The transaction is expected to close in March 2007. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $944.6 million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the foreseeable future. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans We adopted the funded status recognition provision of SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006. This standard amends SFAS 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by SFAS 158. The pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31. Our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $11.9 million for the year 33 ended December 31, 2006. The largest portion of our 2006 pension expense was $4.1 million for our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected return on plan assets for our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets of 7.5%. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Based on this review, we believe that 7.5% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2006. We will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust these returns as necessary. The current asset allocation for our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 49.3% invested in equity securities and 50.7% invested in fixed income securities, which is in accordance with the plans asset allocation requirements. Our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2006 was virtually identical to the plans asset allocation model. Our investment manager regularly reviews our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations. We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2006, under the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, we had cumulative gains of approximately $11.3 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index (formerly Salomon Brothers Pension Liability Index), which was at 5.9% at December 31, 2006, up from 5.55% at December 31, 2005. As a result, we selected 6.0% for its December 31, 2006 discount rate, which was up from 5.5% as of December 31, 2005. The duration of the Citigroup Pension Liability Index at December 31, 2006 was 15.9 years, which approximates the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities. We estimate that our pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan will be approximately $1.0 million in 2007. The pension expense estimate for 2007 is based on a 6.0% discount rate. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrecognized pension losses of $59.4 million, of which $44.4 million is for the U.S. Plan. We performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2006, if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 4.5% 5.5% 6.5% (in millions) 6.50% $ 8.9 $ 6.1 $ 3.6 7.50% 6.9 4.1 1.5 8.50% 4.8 2.0 (0.5 ) Our funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $208.2 million at December 31, 2005 to $249.0 million at December 31, 2006. Our contributions and investment performance have eliminated the deficit of our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, net of benefit obligations, of $20.2 million at December 31, 2005 and created a surplus of $31.5 million at December 31, 2006. During 2006, we contributed $20.0 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Based upon the plans funded status as of December 31, 2006 we do not expect to make any contributions in 2007 to this plan. 34 Equity Compensation Plans In addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note O: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006. The 2006 Equity Plan replaces our 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan, our 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and our 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 Equity Plan. We may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans, but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise, vesting or expiration. The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2006 (share numbers in thousands): Plan category Number of securitiesto be issued uponexercise ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Weighted averageexercise price ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Number of securities remainingavailable for future issuanceunder equity compensationplans (excluding securitiesreflected in column (1)) Equity plans approved by shareholders 4,014 (1) $ 19.42 13,169 (3) Equity plans not approved by shareholders (4) 15,941 (2) $ 20.34 Total 19,955 $ 20.16 13,169 (1) Includes 98,000 shares of restricted stock units that are not included in the calculation of the weighted average exercise price. (2) Includes 1,030,000 shares of restricted stock units that are not included in the calculation of the weighted average exercise price. (3) Consists of 11,901,000 securities available for issuance under the 2006 Equity Plan and 1,268,000 of securities available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. (4) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), we assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of our common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of our common stock for each share of GenRads common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2006, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 184 shares of our common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $70.66 per share. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to motivate employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan is 12,000,000 shares of our common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock based awards in the form of (1) non qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock based awards. Awards may be tied to time based vesting schedules and or performance based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the 2006 Equity Plan. Awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of Teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. The maximum number of shares of stock based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan will expire on May 24, 2016. As mentioned above, our 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) was terminated on May 25, 2006, when we adopted our 2006 Equity Plan. Our 1997 Plan was not approved by our shareholders. The 1997 35 Plan allowed us to issue options and stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock units) to our employees, consultants and directors and also to issue deferred stock units to directors. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors administered the 1997 Plan and specified at the time of grant of an award, the pertinent terms of such award, including, if such award is an option, whether it was an incentive stock option or non qualified stock option, the exercise price and vesting provisions. Under the 1997 Plan, as of December 31, 2006, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 14,911,000 shares, outstanding restricted stock units which can convert into an aggregate of 1,030,000 shares, and 20,774 shares reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding director deferred stock units. Most of the outstanding options issued under the 1997 Plan vest in equal installments over two or four years and have a maximum term of either five or seven years. The restricted stock units issued under the 1997 Plan vest in equal installments over two years. As of December 31, 2006 total unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested awards and options totaled $15.7 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years.

Related Party Transactions In January of 2006, Paul Tufano, a member of our Board of Directors, became Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Solectron Corporation. In the ordinary course of business, we have for the last ten years purchased printed circuit board assemblies from Solectron and has also sold in circuit testers to Solectron. In the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we purchased $229.9 million, $153.1 million and $141.5 million of printed circuit board assemblies from Solectron, respectively. Sales of in circuit testers to Solectron for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $5.7 million, $5.7 million and $2.2. million, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $7.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively, was included in accounts payable and $1.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, was included in accounts receivable, representing amounts due to/from Solectron. We believe that these purchases and sales were made on terms and conditions that were fair and not less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. We expect to continue our relationship with Solectron in 2007 in similar terms. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R. In annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, SFAS 123R would eliminate the ability to account for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value based method under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to record in their Statements of Operations equity based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. We adopted SFAS 123R beginning in the first quarter of 2006, as required, using the Modified Prospective method, and did not restate prior periods. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 modifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs, and the manner in which companies allocate fixed overhead expenses to inventory. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We implemented SFAS 151 beginning in the first quarter of 2006 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of FIN No. 48 will not have a material impact on our financial positions or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Benefit Plans, an amendment of FASB statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158), which requires companies to recognize the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. The funded status is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the plans asset and the benefit obligation of the plan, which results in the recognition of a net liability or net asset. For a pension plans, the benefit obligation is a projected benefit obligation ( the PBO); for other postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (the APBO). The projected benefit obligation ( the PBO) represents actuarial present value of vested and non vested benefits attributed to the plan through the pension benefit formula for service rendered to that date based on employees future salary levels. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (the APBO) represents 37 an actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service that has been rendered to date. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires that any pension or post retirement benefit related unrecognized gains/losses, prior service costs/credits, and net transition assets/obligations expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost in future periods, be recorded within other comprehensive income/(loss). Upon adoption of SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, the impact of recording our unrecognized losses, prior service costs and net transition obligations was a decrease to shareholders equity of $64.6 million. In September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our financial positions or results of operations. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and marketable securities investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher, which have minimal credit risk. We place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management We regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the European Euro, Great Britain Pound, Japanese Yen and the Taiwan Dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. We do not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On these bases, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $2.6 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 38
