Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, 18 contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. Our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract. We also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Our post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. We defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Technical Bulletin 90 1. Our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. We classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. We generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions (SOP 97 2). We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. 19 For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value. We record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2007 was $80.3 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $105.6 million. Equity Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provision of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). Stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after January 1, 2006 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of SFAS 123R. As required by SFAS 123R, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest. The cumulative effect of the initial adoption of SFAS 123R was not material. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 (APB 25). In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share based payments for public companies. We have applied provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note B: Accounting Policies and Note O: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation. On May 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding, unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time. The stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of $13.26, the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005 and ranged in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. As a result of the vesting acceleration, options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under SFAS 123R by approximately $48.6 million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of its review undertaken at December 31, 2002, we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized 20 and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions, most notably the United States. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, we maintained our valuation allowance at December 31, 2007 and 2006. This valuation allowance may reverse at some time in the future if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. We continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Any reversal of the valuation allowance will result in an increase in our net income, but not to the full extent of the reversal in the quarter in which reversal of the tax asset valuation allowance is made. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.

Broadband Test Division had revenues for the seven month period ended July 31, 2007 of $11.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $20.6 million, and for the year ending December 31, 2005 of $30.1 million. Loss from discontinued operations of our Broadband Test Division for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $6.3 million, loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $5.5 million, and income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $3.2 million. In 2007, we recorded a gain on the sale of Broadband Test Division of $5.9 million, net of a tax provision of $0.4 million. On November 30, 2005, we completed the sale of our Connection Systems to Amphenol Corporation for an adjusted purchase price of $384.7 million. Connection Systems had revenues for the eleven month period ended November 30, 2005 of $331.0 million. Loss from discontinued operations of Connection Systems for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $3.9 million, relating to a change in estimate to tax expenses from the sale. Under applicable accounting guidance, there is an offsetting tax benefit recorded in continuing operations for the same amount. This tax provision results from the finalization of the 2005 U.S. tax return. Income from Connection Systems through the date of sale in 2005 was $151.1 million, including a gain on sale of Connection Systems of $137.0 million, net of a tax provision of $31.0 million. In accordance with SFAS 144, we are reporting Broadband Test Division and Connection Systems as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless indicated otherwise, the discussion and amounts provided in this Results of Operations section and elsewhere in this Form 10 K relate to continuing operations only. Bookings Our net orders for our two reportable segments for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007DollarChange 2005 2006DollarChange (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 899.7 $ 1,012.6 $ 880.4 $ (112.9 ) $ 132.2 Systems Test Group 208.2 270.5 260.7 (62.3 ) 9.8 $ 1,107.9 $ 1,283.1 $ 1,141.1 $ (175.2 ) $ 142.0 The Semiconductor Test business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for test equipment, which historically has been highly cyclical. The Semiconductor Test bookings decrease of $112.9 million or 11% from 2006 to 2007 was driven by less demand across a wide range of end markets, applications and geographies, as SOC device units grew at a lower rate in 2007 than in 2006. This decrease was lessened by our Semiconductor Test increase in SOC market share during 2007 by approximately 2 to 3 points. The increase of $132.2 million or 15% in Semiconductor Test bookings from 2005 to 2006 was attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets, as customers invested in SOC test equipment, principally in the first half of 2006. During 2006, the Flex family of testers moved into mainstream production and, along with the J750 platform, contributed to almost all of the growth experienced. We also saw a customer shift in orders from 2005 to 2006 with subcontractors making up a larger percentage of orders. The Systems Test Groups decrease of $62.3 million or 23% in orders from 2006 to 2007 was due to decreases in each business unit. Diagnostic Solutions orders are program related and have significant fluctuations. Bookings were down due to a large program rollout in 2006 for the Vehicle Measurement Module product line. Mil/Aero Test bookings are also often program related and bookings decreased in 2007 compared to 2006, as a significant military program concluded during 2007. Commercial Board Test bookings decreased in 22 2007 due to a contraction in the size of the ICT market. The Systems Test Groups increase of $9.8 million or 4% in orders from 2005 to 2006 was primarily driven by demand in the Mil/Aero Test business due to the cyclical nature of the Mil/Aero Test program buys, offset slightly by a decrease in Diagnostic Solutions. Our order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our two reportable segments for the last three years are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 13.6 $ 3.3 $ 15.2 Systems Test Group 0.3 0.5 $ 13.9 $ 3.8 $ 15.2 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2007 and 2006, there were no significant cancellation penalties received. Due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 United States 22 % 28 % 25 % South East Asia 24 20 24 Europe 12 14 16 Singapore 14 12 13 Japan 11 13 10 Taiwan 16 12 10 Rest of the World 1 1 2 100 % 100 % 100 % For the past three years, our backlog of unfilled orders for our two reportable segments is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 236.2 $ 212.4 $ 289.7 Systems Test Group 102.5 120.2 117.1 $ 338.7 $ 332.6 $ 406.8 Revenue Our net revenue for our two reportable segments for 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007DollarChange 2005 2006DollarChange (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 876.5 $ 1,088.9 $ 814.2 $ (212.4 ) $ 274.7 Systems Test Group 225.8 267.3 230.9 (41.5 ) 36.4 $ 1,102.3 $ 1,356.2 $ 1,045.1 $ (253.9 ) $ 311.1 23 Semiconductor Test decrease in revenue of $212.4 million or 20% from 2006 to 2007 is due to SOC device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was lessened by our Semiconductor Test increase in SOC market share during 2007 by approximately 2 to 3 points. This resulted in decreased demand across a wide range of end markets, applications and geographies. Semiconductor Test revenue increase of $274.7 million or 34% from 2005 to 2006 can be attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets, as customers invested in SOC test equipment. Almost the entire increase in 2006 is related to our FLEX family and J750 products and is distributed across all regions. The increase is partially offset by a decrease of certain non FLEX test systems. Systems Test Group revenue decrease of $41.5 million or 16% from 2006 to 2007 can be attributed to a decrease in Diagnostic Solutions sales, due to a large program rollout in 2006 for the Vehicle Measurement Module product line. The Systems Test Group increase of $36.4 million or 16% in revenue from 2005 to 2006 was driven by a strong increase in Diagnostic Solutions sales due primarily to the Vehicle Measurement Module product line. Our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2007 2006 2005 Semiconductor Test 80 % 80 % 78 % Systems Test Group 20 20 22 100 % 100 % 100 % Our net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 United States 23 % 23 % 22 % South East Asia 22 24 24 Europe 12 14 15 Taiwan 13 14 13 Japan 12 12 9 Singapore 15 11 14 Rest of the World 3 2 3 100 % 100 % 100 % Our product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007DollarChange 2005 2006DollarChange (in millions) Product Revenue $ 861.6 $ 1,118.8 $ 847.2 $ (257.2 ) $ 271.6 Service Revenue 240.7 237.4 197.9 3.3 39.5 $ 1,102.3 $ 1,356.2 $ 1,045.1 $ (253.9 ) $ 311.1 Although product revenue decreased $257.2 million or 23% in 2007 from 2006 due to SOC device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006, service revenue, which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products, remained relatively flat from 2006. Service revenue includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 16%, 18% and 18% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. 24 Gross Margin 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007Dollar / PointChange 2005 2006Dollar / PointChange (dollars in millions) Gross Margin $ 513.4 $ 651.9 $ 395.1 $ (138.5 ) $ 256.8 Percent of Total Revenue 46.6 % 48.1 % 37.8 % (1.5 ) 10.3 The decrease in gross margin of 1.5 points from 2006 to 2007 was the result of several factors. A reduction in Semiconductor Test sales volume contributed to a decrease of 1.5 points. A shift in product mix, primarily related to higher service revenue as a percentage of total revenue, contributed to a decrease of 2 points. These decreases were offset by an increase of 1 point due to lower Semiconductor Test inventory provisions in 2007, and an increase of 1 point resulting from lower fixed costs and employee compensation across both segments. The increase in gross margin of approximately 10 points from 2005 to 2006 was the result of several factors. An increase in Semiconductor Test sales volume contributed 4 points; a shift in product mix within Semiconductor Test contributed 2 points; an improvement in service margins, primarily within Semiconductor Test, contributed 2 points; the remaining 2 point increase was due to lower inventory provisions in 2006, as we recorded a $38.5 million charge for non FLEX products in the Semiconductor Test segment in 2005, compared to an $8.0 million charge for non FLEX products in 2006. The breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007Dollar / PointChange 2005 2006Dollar / PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Margin $ 431.1 $ 568.5 $ 345.0 $ (137.4 ) $ 223.5 Percent of Product Revenue 50.0 % 50.8 % 40.7 % (0.8 ) 10.1 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007Dollar / PointChange 2005 2006Dollar / PointChange (dollars in millions) Service Gross Margin $ 82.3 $ 83.4 $ 50.0 $ (1.1 ) $ 33.4 Percent of Service Revenue 34.2 % 35.1 % 25.3 % (0.9 ) 9.8 We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. These write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components. Sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision, which is recorded in cost of revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we sold inventory previously reserved of $1.2 million, $2.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded inventory provisions of $1.8 million in cost of revenues of which $0.3 million was for excess inventory and $1.5 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $1.8 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $0.5 million related to Semiconductor Test and $1.3 million related to Systems Test Group. 25 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded inventory provisions of $12.8 million in cost of revenues of which $11.7 million was for excess inventory and $1.1 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $12.8 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $11.5 million related to Semiconductor Test (including an $8.0 million provision for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory) and $1.3 million related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded inventory provisions of $49.0 million in cost of revenues of which $36.9 million was for excess inventory and $12.1 million was for obsolete inventory. Of the $49.0 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $45.5 million related to Semiconductor Test (including a $38.5 million provision for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory) and $3.5 million related to Systems Test Group. We scrapped $33.5 million, $29.5 million, and $34.1 million of inventory, which had been previously written down or written off, during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We have no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory that has been previously written down to net realizable value. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down to net realizable value of $105.6 million and $138.4 million, respectively. Of the reserves at December 31, 2007, $1.8 million, $11.3 million, $46.9 million, and $45.6 million relate to inventory provisions recorded in 2007, 2006, 2005, and prior to 2005, respectively. Engineering and Development 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007Change 2005 2006Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 204.3 $ 202.4 $ 216.4 $ 1.9 $ (14.0 ) Percent of Total Revenue 18.6 % 14.9 % 20.7 % The increase of $1.9 million in engineering and development expenses from 2006 to 2007 was due in part to a $10.3 million increase in spending related to new products and entry into adjacent markets, primarily in the Semiconductor Test segment. This was partially offset by lower variable employee compensation of $8.4 million. During 2006 and 2005, we reduced our levels of investment in engineering and development spending. More than 80% of our total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the Semiconductor Test segment, where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between $150 and $250 million. During 2005, Semiconductor Test completed its UltraFLEX platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its FLEX Test Platform (UltraFLEX and FLEX) which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures. The decrease of $14.0 million in engineering and development spending from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following amounts: $25.4 million decrease due to a reduction in headcount primarily in the U.S., offset partially by an increase in engineering and development activities in low cost regions; and $6.5 million decrease due to the completion of certain portions of the FLEX Test Platform engineering work. These decreases were partially offset by the following: $10.9 million increase due to higher variable employee compensation; and $7.0 million increase due to stock based compensation. 26 Selling and Administrative 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007Change 2005 2006Change (dollars in millions) Selling and Administrative $ 250.8 $ 283.0 $ 246.0 $ (32.2 ) $ 37.0 Percent of Total Revenue 22.8 % 20.9 % 23.5 % The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $32.2 million from 2006 to 2007 consists of the following: $13.5 million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation; and $18.7 million in lower transition expenses, including the consolidation of facilities in Massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions, both of which occurred in 2006. The increase in selling and administrative spending of $37.0 million from 2005 to 2006 consists of the following: $19.5 million increase due to higher variable employee compensation; $14.1 million increase due to transition expenses, including the consolidation of facilities in Massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions; and $11.4 million increase due to stock based compensation. These increases from 2005 to 2006 were partially offset by the following: $6.7 million decrease due to a reduction in headcount; and $1.3 million decrease in foreign exchange expense. In process Research and Development On March 7, 2007, we purchased in process enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from MOSAID Technologies Inc. for $17.6 million, which includes $0.6 million in fees directly related to the acquisition. Of the purchase price, $16.7 million has been allocated to in process research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations. The balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets. This technology was purchased to be used in the development of a new semiconductor test product. As of the acquisition date, the technology had not reached technical feasibility, had no alternative future use and its fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability, and therefore has been classified as in process research and development. The technology is unique to the semiconductor test market and requires significant development. The estimated fair value of the in process technology was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model using an income approach. Estimated cash flows were probability adjusted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the in process technology. Such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process project as well as the estimated cash flows to be generated as a result of completing the project development. Restructuring and Other, Net In response to a downturn in the industry, we initiated restructuring activities in 2002 across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations. Further 27 actions were initiated in 2003, to a lesser extent in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Additionally, in 2005, 2006 and 2007 as part of our facility consolidation, we sold certain real estate. The tables below represent activity related to these actions. The remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet. The remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the long term other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2012. We expect to pay out approximately $2.2 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Our future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $7.8 million as of December 31, 2007. We have subleased approximately 55% of our unoccupied space as of December 31, 2007 and are actively attempting to sublease the remaining space. 2007 Activities Gain on Saleof Landand Buildings SeveranceandBenefits InsuranceRecovery Total (in thousands) 2007 (credit) provision $ (3,597 ) $ 6,963 $ (4,326 ) $ (960 ) Cash receipts (payments) 3,597 (5,855 ) 4,326 2,068 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ $ 1,108 $ $ 1,108 We recorded the following activity related to the 2007 restructuring activities: $3.6 million gain on the sale of land and building in Deerfield, Illinois; $7.0 million of severance charges related to headcount of 202 people across all functions and segments; and $4.3 million of cash proceeds recovered from insurance related to a facility fire in Taiwan.

During February 2008, we implemented reduction in force activities across all reportable segments, functions and geographies. This will include a reduction of approximately 175 employees and a severance charge during the first quarter of 2008 of approximately $9.5 million. These actions are expected to result in annual savings of approximately $25 million.

The increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributable to higher cash balances primarily from the proceeds received from the divestiture of Connection Systems. The decrease in interest expense from 2006 to 2007 was due primarily to the repayment of our 3.75% Senior Convertible Notes (the Notes) in 2006. The decrease in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to the repayment of Notes in the fourth quarter of 2006 and repurchases made earlier in the year.

The increase in Corporate from 2006 to 2007 is primarily related to the elimination of our interest expense due to the repayment of our Notes in 2006 and gains from sales of real estate which totaled $3.6 million. The change to an income position from 2005 to 2006 was mainly attributable to increased sales in Semiconductor Test and to a lesser extent gains on the sale of real estate, primarily in Semiconductor Test, and additional interest income, net included in Corporate of $32.0 million. Income Taxes During 2007, the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $7.4 million. The expense relates primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes offset by benefits related to the utilization of foreign tax credits in the U.S. During 2006, the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $27.9 million. The expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes offset by benefits from a $6.0 million credit related to U.S. pension funding and the settlement of a California income tax audit for 1998 through 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2005, there was a tax benefit from continuing operations that totaled $19.7 million. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), a benefit for $29.2 million was recognized for losses 30 relating to 2005 continuing operations, as a result of the sale of Connection Systems. There was an equal and offsetting tax provision in the gain on sale of Connection System in discontinued operations. The remaining portion of the net tax benefit includes a tax provision that related primarily to foreign taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $201.7 million in 2007 from 2006, to $742.9 million. Cash activity for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 2006 2007Change 2005 2006Change Cash provided by operating activities: Income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for non cash items $ 176.0 $ 283.8 $ 32.6 $ (107.8 ) $ 251.2 Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired (44.2 ) 169.1 (49.2 ) (213.3 ) 218.3 Cash (used for) provided by discontinued operations (3.6 ) (2.8 ) 30.1 (0.8 ) (32.9 ) Total cash provided by operating activities $ 128.2 $ 450.1 $ 13.5 $ (321.9 ) $ 436.6 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities for continuing operations 105.8 196.6 (184.4 ) (90.8 ) 381.0 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations 10.8 (0.4 ) 366.4 11.2 (366.8 ) Total cash provided by investing activities $ 116.6 $ 196.2 $ 182.0 $ (79.6 ) $ 14.2 Total cash used for financing activities $ (250.5 ) $ (419.0 ) $ (63.9 ) $ 168.5 $ (355.1 ) Total $ (5.7 ) $ 227.3 $ 131.6 $ (233.0 ) $ 95.7 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, used cash of $44.2 million in 2007. This was due to a number of factors including, an increase in accounts receivable of $33.7 million due to an increase in days sales outstanding from 55 days in 2006 to 66 days in 2007, a reduction of accrued income taxes of $30.9 million due to the payments of 2006 foreign income taxes around the world, and an increase in other assets of $25.0 million primarily related to balances due for inventory provided to our outsourced subcontract manufacturer of $15.7 million. These uses of cash were offset by a decrease in our inventory balances due to shorter cycle times with our FLEX products. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, provided cash of $169.1 million in 2006 31 primarily due to a decrease of accounts receivable balances of $67.9 million resulting mostly from the decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Additionally, there was a decrease in inventory of $79.3 million due to shorter cycle times with our FLEX products, and an increase of $32.8 million in accrued income taxes due to higher foreign income taxes in 2006 compared to 2005. These providers of cash were partially offset by retirement plan contributions of $30.2 million of which $20.0 million was a contribution to our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, used cash of $49.2 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $58.7 million and retirement plan contributions of $40.1 million, partially offset by a $69.9 million decrease in inventory. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of businesses, proceeds from asset disposals, proceeds from the sale of product lines, cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets. Capital expenditures were $86.1 million in 2007, $110.0 million in 2006, and $112.7 million in 2005. Capital expenditures decreased by $23.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease of internally manufactured systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in Semiconductor Test of approximately $18.1 million. The remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across Teradyne. Proceeds from asset disposals were $8.8 million and $85.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively and primarily consist of sales of real estate. In March 2007, we bought an enabling technology from MOSAID Technologies Inc. for a purchase price and related costs totaling $17.6 million. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $10.8 million of cash in 2007. Included in this balance is the net proceeds we received related to the sale of our Broadband Test Division to Tollgrade in August 2007. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $366.4 million of cash in 2005 and includes the net proceeds related to our sale of Connection Systems to Amphenol Corporation in November 2005. Financing activities include issuance of our common stock, repurchases of Teradynes common stock as well as repayments of debt. During 2006 and 2005, repayments of long term debt used cash of $304.6 million and $98.7 million, respectively. Upon maturity in the fourth quarter of 2006, we paid off the outstanding balance of our outstanding Notes, which approximated $261 million aggregate principal. We also repurchased portions of our outstanding Notes in the first and third quarters of 2006, in the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and the third quarter of 2004. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated $23.2 million, $23.3 million, and $34.7 million, respectively. In July 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which was completed in October 2007. In total, $400 million of common stock was repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2006, we repurchased 10.6 million shares of common stock for $137.8 million for an average price per share of $12.98. During 2007, we repurchased 17.3 million shares of common stock for $262.2 million for an average price per share of $15.13. In November 2007, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program, allowing us to spend an aggregate of $400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007, we repurchased 1.0 million shares of our common stock under this program for an average price per share of $11.66. In October 2001, we issued $400 million principal amount of the Notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. We made annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. In August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $100 million of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 101.50% of the principal amount. The Board subsequently amended its authorization on October 21, 2005 to authorize repurchases through open market purchases, privately negotiated transaction, auctions, by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by our CEO or CFO, at prices below 100.75% of the principal amount. The $100 million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of 2004 and the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to repurchase $8.5 million, $20.0 million and $71.5 million of the Notes, respectively. The decision to repurchase a portion of the Notes was based on the fair market value of the Notes being below 32 the return we would earn on high grade investment securities. On January 26, 2006, management was given further authorization by our Board to repurchase up to the full $300 million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the Notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon. During 2006, we repurchased Notes of $15.0 million in the first quarter, $24.0 million in the third quarter, and we repaid the remaining $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Unrealized losses related to our marketable securities totaled $1.2 million at December 31, 2007. Approximately $33.7 million of our total investment portfolio of marketable securities were invested in debt securities that have an unrealized loss that has existed for greater than one year as of December 31, 2007. Of the securities, $15 million mature within the first quarter of 2008. We review our investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in market value. Based on our review, we have determined that the unrealized losses are temporary. On January 24, 2008, we completed the acquisition of Nextest for an estimated purchase price of $325 million. This estimated purchase price is net of the cash acquired and includes the fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments and transaction costs. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at December 31, 2007 of $742.9 million will be sufficient to fund the acquisition of Nextest as well as meet the working capital and expenditure needs for at least the foreseeable future. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans We adopted the funded status recognition provision of SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006. This standard amends SFAS 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by SFAS 158. The pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31. Our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The largest portion of our 2007 pension expense was $3.1 million for our Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations. Two assumptions: discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Based on this review, we believe that 7.75% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal 2007. We will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust the rate as necessary. The current asset allocation for our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 46.3% invested in equity securities and 53.7% invested in fixed income securities, which is in accordance with the plans asset allocation requirements. Our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2007 was virtually identical to the plans asset allocation model. Our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations. 33 We base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2007, under the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, we had cumulative gains of approximately $3.2 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, which was 6.5% at December 31, 2007, up from 5.9% at December 31, 2006. As a result, we selected 6.5% for our December 31, 2007 discount rate, up from 6.0% as of December 31, 2006. The duration of the Citigroup Pension Liability Index at December 31, 2007 was 15.1 years, which approximates the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities. We estimate that in 2008 we will recognize approximately $2.2 million of pension benefit for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. The pension benefit estimate for 2008 is based on a 6.5% discount rate, and 7.75% return on Plan assets. Future pension expense or benefit will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans. As of December 31, 2007, we had unrecognized pension losses of $47.1 million, of which $34.2 million is for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. We performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense (benefit) that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2007, if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 6.0% 6.5% 7.0% (in millions) 7.25% $ 0.2 $ (1.0 ) $ (1.9 ) 7.75% (1.0 ) (2.2 ) (3.1 ) 8.25% (2.2 ) (3.4 ) (4.3 ) The assets of the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $249.0 million at December 31, 2006 to $254.0 million at December 31, 2007. Our funding policy is to make contributions to the Pension Plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2007, there were no additional contributions made to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, and we made $2.6 million of additional contributions to certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries. Based upon the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan funded status as of December 31, 2007, we do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in 2008. Contributions that will be made in 2008 to certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately $2.4 million. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note O: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006. The 2006 Equity Plan replaces our 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan, our 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and our 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 Equity Plan. We may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans, but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise, vesting or expiration. 34 The following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2007 (share numbers in thousands): Plan category Number of securitiesto be issued uponexercise ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Weighted averageexercise price ofoutstanding options,warrants and rights Number of securities remainingavailable for future issuanceunder equity compensationplans (excluding securitiesreflected in column (1)) Equity plans approved by shareholders 5,472 (1) $ 18.75 15,688 (3) Equity plans not approved by shareholders(4) 13,292 (2) $ 20.64 Total 18,764 $ 20.25 15,688 (1) Includes 2,022,000 shares of restricted stock units that are not included in the calculation of the weighted average exercise price.

(3) Consists of 9,980,000 securities available for issuance under the 2006 Equity Plan and 5,708,000 of securities available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. (4) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), we assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of our common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of our common stock for each share of GenRads common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2007, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 139,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $68.56 per share. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to motivate employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan as of December 31, 2007 was 9,980,000 shares of our common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock based awards in the form of (1) non qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock based awards. Awards may be tied to time based vesting schedules and or performance based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the 2006 Equity Plan. Awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of Teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. The maximum number of shares of stock based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan will expire on May 24, 2016. In 2007 and 2006, we only issued restricted stock unit awards to our employees and directors. As of December 31, 2007 total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested awards and options totaled $24.9 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.91 years.

Related Party Transaction During 2007, Paul Tufano, a member of our Board of Directors, was Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Solectron Corporation until it was acquired by Flextronics in October 2007. Mr. Tufano is no longer an employee of Solectron or Flextronics. In the ordinary course of business, we have for the last ten years purchased printed circuit board assemblies from Solectron, and have also sold in circuit testers to Solectron which we refer to as Flextronics. In August 2007, prior to the Flextronics acquisition, we expanded our contract with Solectron to have it provide additional manufacturing and test services, including areas of final configuration and test for most of our FLEX family of products. In the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we purchased $207.8 million, $229.9 million and $153.1 million of printed circuit board assemblies and services from Flextronics, respectively. Sales of in circuit testers to Flextronics for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $4.0 million, $5.7 million and $5.7 million respectively. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $19.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, was included in accounts payable and $17.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, was included in accounts receivable, representing amounts due to/from Flextronics. We believe that these purchases and sales were made on terms and conditions that were fair and not less favorable than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. 36 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes new principles and requirements for how an acquiring company 1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree, 2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, and 3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and marketable securities investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities, rated A or higher, which have minimal credit risk. The overall weighted average portfolio quality will be maintained at a minimum of AA or better at all times. We place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management We regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the European Euro, Great Britain Pound, Japanese Yen and the Taiwan Dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. We do not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. The principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates. Investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On these bases, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $0.3 million and $2.6 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 37
