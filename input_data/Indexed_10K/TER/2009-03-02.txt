Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements, made pursuant to Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. 20 Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. Our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract. We also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Our post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. We defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Technical Bulletin 90 1, Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts. Our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. We classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. We generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is 21 the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. We record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. Equity Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provision of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). Stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after January 1, 2006 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of SFAS 123R. As required by SFAS 123R, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest. The cumulative effect of the initial adoption of SFAS 123R was not material. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 (APB 25). In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share based payments for public companies. We have applied provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123R. On May 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding, unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time. The stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of $13.26, the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005 and ranged in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. As a result of the vesting acceleration, options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under SFAS 123R by approximately $48.6 million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of this review, undertaken at December 31, 2002, we concluded under 22 applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions, most notably the United States. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, we have maintained our valuation allowance at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Investments We account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS No. 115) and FASB Staff Position Nos. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. On a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include: The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; and The intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We have determined that we do not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an other than temporary impairment loss in the amount of $11.0 million, in the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) for financial assets and liabilities. As defined in SFAS No. 157, fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. We use the market and income approach techniques to value our financial instruments. SFAS No. 157 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly as of the reporting date. For example, a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices, and therefore is considered a Level 2 input. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available, which might include Teradynes own data. As a result of our November 14, 2008 acquisition of Eagle Test, we acquired $26.5 million of auction rate securities (ARS) at fair value ($30.0 million par value). In addition, we acquired (1) the right (UBS Put) to sell our ARS back to UBS at par plus interest, at our sole discretion, during a two year period beginning on June 30, 2010, and (2) received an option to borrow up to 75% of the fair value of the ARS at no cost. Beginning in February 2008 and continuing through December 31, 2008, the securities in our acquired ARS portfolio have experienced failed auctions, resulting in inability to sell these securities. Consequently, as set forth in the trust indentures, the coupon rate resets to a contractual rate which may not equal the current market rate. A failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not necessarily represent a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer. All of our ARS, are AAA, AA or A rated by one or more of the major credit rating 23 agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a U.S. Department of Education agency or a third party insurer. At December 31, 2008, the underlying securities for the ARS have remaining maturities ranging from five to thirty one years. Substantially, all of these securities are collateralized by student loans. The estimated fair value of our ARS portfolio was $26.0 million as of December 31, 2008. Because the UBS Put is expected to allow us to sell our ARS securities at par within a relatively short time horizon and provides UBS with the ability to require us to sell the securities to them at any time between acceptance of the UBS Put through July 2012, we do not anticipate holding these investments to the earlier of maturity or redemption by the issuer. We intend to exercise the UBS Put and require UBS to repurchase our ARS at par at the earliest possible time, June 2010. As a result, as of the Eagle Test acquisition date (November 14, 2008), we classified the ARS as trading securities under SFAS No. 115. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a loss of $0.5 million in interest expense and other, net in our consolidated statement of operations for the decrease in the ARS fair value from November 14, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Future changes in fair value of the ARS will be recorded in operating results. In determining the fair value of our ARS and other investments we utilize the provisions of SFAS No. 157. In determining the value of our ARS as of December 31, 2008 we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model with the major inputs to such model based on our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing these instruments. Specifically, we used the following key inputs to our valuation model: Term we estimated a five year expected life of the instruments, based on our expectations of the most likely time in which it would take for the instruments to be called by the issuer or liquidity to be restored to the market place. Probability of Default we determined the probability of default using market credit spreads. Discount Rate we determined the discount rate based on estimated yields of similar publicly traded instruments (e.g., similar collateral, terms, credit quality, etc.). Liquidity Risk Premium given the recent instability in the financial markets and the low demand for auction rate securities, it is unclear as to when these securities will become liquid again. Without the auction process functioning again, it would be extremely difficult to estimate the expected holding period for these instruments. As a result, we included a 500 to 600 basis point premium to the discount rate to reflect the illiquidity of these bonds. Based on these key inputs, we estimated the fair value of our ARS portfolio was $26.0 million as of December 31, 2008 representing a $0.5 million decrease in fair value since November 14, 2008. Our ARS securities and the related put option were the only investments as of December 31, 2008 in which we utilized Level 3 valuation techniques under SFAS No. 157. On November 14, 2008, we recognized the UBS Put as an asset measured at a fair value of $2.7 million. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the UBS Put was $3.3 million. We recorded a $0.6 million gain in interest income during the fourth quarter of 2008 for the increase in the fair value of the UBS Put since November 14, 2008. In determining the fair value of the UBS Put as of December 31, 2008, we assumed we would redeem the auction rate securities at par at the earliest possible time, June 30, 2010. We utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the UBS Put using the following assumptions (1) a time period of 1.5 years, representing the period from December 31, 2008 to the earliest date we can expect to be able to redeem the UBS Put (June 30, 2010) and (2) a discount rate of 3.79%, which included a spread based on the credit default swap of UBS in order to account for the credit risk of UBS. We have elected fair value treatment for the UBS Put under SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). The UBS Put is the only instrument of its nature/type that we hold and for which we have elected the fair value option under SFAS No. 159. 24 Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. We determined that the worsening in our demand outlook experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 was a significant event that indicated that the carrying amount of certain long lived and intangible asset groups might not be recoverable. We conducted recoverability tests in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). As the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset groups exceeded their carrying amount, we determined that no impairment of our long lived assets had occurred at December 31, 2008.

Broadband Test Division had revenues for the seven month period ended July 31, 2007 of $11.2 million 25 and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $20.6 million. Loss from discontinued operations of our Broadband Test Division for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $6.3 million and loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $5.6 million. In 2007, we recorded a gain on the sale of Broadband Test Division of $5.9 million, net of a tax provision of $0.4 million. In accordance with SFAS 144, we are reporting Broadband Test Division as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless indicated otherwise, the discussion and amounts provided in this Results of Operations section and elsewhere in this Form 10 K relate to continuing operations only. Bookings Net bookings for our two reportable segments were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008DollarChange 2006 2007DollarChange (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 768.1 $ 899.7 $ 1,012.6 $ (131.6 ) $ (112.9 ) Systems Test Group 211.5 208.2 270.5 3.3 (62.3 ) $ 979.6 $ 1,107.9 $ 1,283.1 $ (128.3 ) $ (175.2 ) The Semiconductor Test business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for test equipment, which historically has been highly cyclical. Semiconductor Test bookings decreased $131.6 million or 15% from 2007 to 2008 due primarily to lower demand across all customer groups. In 2008, Nextest contributed $67.6 million of bookings and Eagle Test contributed $1.0 million of bookings. The Semiconductor Test bookings decreased $112.9 million or 11% from 2006 to 2007 due to lower demand across a wide range of end markets, applications and geographies, as SOC device units grew at a lower rate in 2007 than in 2006. The lower demand in SOC market was lessened by our increase in SOC market share during 2007, by approximately 2 to 3 points. Systems Test Group bookings increased $3.3 million or 2% from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to an increase in Mil/Aero board test program related bookings partially offset by decreases in Commercial Board Test and Diagnostic Solutions. Systems Test Group bookings decreased $62.3 million or 23% from 2006 to 2007, primarily due to decreases across all business units. Diagnostic Solutions orders are program related and have significant fluctuations. There was a large program rollout in 2006 for the Vehicle Measurement Module product line. Mil/Aero bookings are also often program related, and there was also a significant military program that took place in 2006. Commercial Board Test bookings decreased in 2007 due to a contraction in the size of the ICT market. Order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our two reportable segments for the last three years were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 10.3 $ 13.6 $ 3.3 Systems Test Group 0.3 0.5 $ 10.3 $ 13.9 $ 3.8 Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no significant cancellation penalties received. 26 Due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Net bookings by region as a percentage of our total net bookings were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 United States 27 % 22 % 28 % South East Asia 24 24 20 Taiwan 16 16 12 Europe 11 12 14 Japan 11 11 13 Singapore 10 14 12 Rest of the World 1 1 1 100 % 100 % 100 % For the past three years, our backlog of unfilled orders for our two reportable segments was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 129.4 $ 236.2 $ 212.4 Systems Test Group 106.9 102.5 120.2 $ 236.3 $ 338.7 $ 332.6 Revenue Net revenues for our two reportable segments were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008DollarChange 2006 2007DollarChange (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 900.3 $ 876.5 $ 1,088.9 $ 23.8 $ (212.4 ) Systems Test Group 206.7 225.8 267.3 (19.1 ) (41.5 ) $ 1,107.0 $ 1,102.3 $ 1,356.2 $ 4.7 $ (253.9 ) Semiconductor Test revenue increased $23.8 million or 3% from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to $79.4 million of sales from our Nextest acquisition partially offset by lower sales due to decreased demand due to SOC device units growing at a lower rate in 2008 compared to 2007. Semiconductor Test revenue decreased $212.4 million or 20% from 2006 to 2007 due to SOC device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006. This resulted in decreased demand across a wide range of end markets, applications and geographies. The lower demand rate was lessened by an increase in SOC market share during 2007 by approximately 2 to 3 points. Systems Test Group revenue decreased $19.1 million or 8% from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to a lower Mil/Aero board test program related sales. Systems Test Group revenue decreased $41.5 million or 16% from 2006 to 2007 due to decreased sales in Diagnostic Solutions. The decrease was related to a large program rollout for the Vehicle Measurement Module product line that took place in 2006 and was concluded in 2007. 27 Our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2008 2007 2006 Semiconductor Test 81 % 80 % 80 % Systems Test Group 19 20 20 100 % 100 % 100 % Net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 South East Asia 26 % 22 % 24 % United States 22 23 23 Taiwan 18 13 14 Japan 11 12 12 Singapore 10 15 11 Europe 10 12 14 Rest of the World 3 3 2 100 % 100 % 100 % The breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008DollarChange 2006 2007DollarChange (in millions) Product Revenue $ 836.0 $ 861.6 $ 1,118.8 $ (25.6 ) $ (257.2 ) Service Revenue 271.0 240.7 237.4 30.3 3.3 $ 1,107.0 $ 1,102.3 $ 1,356.2 $ 4.7 $ (253.9 ) Our product revenue decreased $25.6 million or 3% in 2008 from 2007 due to decreased demand. Service revenue, which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales and applications support, increased $30.3 million or 13% due to a larger installed base. Our product revenue decreased $257.2 million or 23% in 2007 from 2006 due to SOC device units growing at a lower rate in 2007 compared to 2006. Service revenue increased $3.3 million or 1% in 2007 from 2006. In the past three years, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 14%, 16%, and 18% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Gross Profit 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008Dollar / PointChange 2006 2007Dollar / PointChange (dollars in millions) Gross Profit $ 498.2 $ 513.4 $ 651.9 $ (15.2 ) $ (138.5 ) Percent of Total Revenue 45.0 % 46.6 % 48.1 % (1.6 ) (1.5 ) 28 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2007 to 2008 by 1.6 percentage points. A decrease of 2.5 points was due to a $27.6 million increase in provision for excess and obsolete inventory recorded as a result of the significant decrease in forecasted semiconductor demand coupled with a product transition; this decrease was partially offset by improved service margins in our Semiconductor Test group. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2006 to 2007 by 1.5 percentage points. A reduction in Semiconductor Test sales volume contributed to a decrease of 1.5 points, a shift in product mix, primarily related to higher service revenue as a percentage of total revenue, contributed to a decrease of 2 points; these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 1 point related to lower Semiconductor Test inventory provision in 2007, and an increase of 1 point resulting from lower fixed costs and employee compensation across both segments. The breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008Dollar / PointChange 2006 2007Dollar / PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Margin $ 384.8 $ 431.1 $ 568.5 $ (46.3 ) $ (137.4 ) Percent of Product Revenue 46.0 % 50.0 % 50.8 % (4.0 ) (0.8 ) Service Gross Margin $ 113.4 $ 82.3 $ 83.4 $ 31.1 $ (1.1 ) Percent of Service Revenue 41.8 % 34.2 % 35.1 % 7.6 (0.9 ) We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. The provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $29.4 million. Of the $29.4 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $24.9 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $4.5 million was related to Systems Test Group. The provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.8 million. Of the $1.8 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $0.5 million related to Semiconductor Test and $1.3 million related to Systems Test Group. The provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $12.8 million. Of the $12.8 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $11.5 million related to Semiconductor Test (including an $8.0 million provision for the write down of excess non FLEX inventory) and $1.3 million related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we scrapped $1.3 million, $33.5 million and $29.5 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $2.4 million, $1.1 million and $2.8 million of previously written down or written off inventory, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we have inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written down or written off totaling $124.9 million. We have no pre determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory. 29 Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008Change 2006 2007Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 216.5 $ 204.3 $ 202.4 $ 12.2 $ 1.9 Percent of Total Revenue 19.6 % 18.6 % 14.9 % The increase of $12.2 million or 6% in engineering and development expenses from 2007 to 2008 was mainly due to an increase of $10.3 million in spending related to investments in adjacent markets, an increase of $12.9 million due to the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test, partially offset by a decrease in other Semiconductor Test spending primarily related to headcount reduction of $8.3 million and lower variable employee compensation of $2.8 million. The increase of $1.9 million or 1% in engineering and development expenses from 2006 to 2007 was due in part to a $10.3 million increase in spending related to new products and entry into adjacent markets, primarily in the Semiconductor Test segment. This was partially offset by lower variable employee compensation of $8.4 million. Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008Change 2006 2007Change (dollars in millions) Selling and Administrative $ 247.8 $ 248.1 $ 278.8 $ (0.3 ) $ (30.7 ) Percent of Total Revenue 22.4 % 22.5 % 20.6 % The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $0.3 million from 2007 to 2008 consists of the following: $14.7 million decrease due to lower labor costs from reductions in headcount, $7.0 million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation, partially offset by $18.5 million increase due to the acquisition of Nextest and $3.0 million increase related to the acquisition of Eagle Test. The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $30.7 million or 11% from 2006 to 2007 consists of the following: $13.5 million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation, $17.2 million decrease due to lower transition expenses, including the consolidation of facilities in Massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions, both of which occurred in 2006. Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization Acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008Change 2006 2007Change (dollars in millions) Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization $ 20.6 $ 3.7 $ 3.6 $ 16.9 $ 0.1 Percent of Total Revenue 1.9 % 0.3 % 0.3 % Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2007 to 2008 due to the acquisitions of Nextest and Eagle Test. Goodwill Impairment In 2008, we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $333.3 million. We experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of 2008. This sharp decline is not expected to recover in the near term. Consequently, this has led to an impairment of our goodwill of $333.3 million as of December 31, 2008. 30 In process Research and Development In 2008, we recorded an expense of $1.6 million related to in process research and development related to the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test. On March 7, 2007, we purchased in process enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from MOSAID Technologies Inc. for $17.6 million, which includes $0.6 million in fees directly related to the acquisition. Of the purchase price, $16.7 million has been allocated to in process research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations. The balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets. In the year ended December 31, 2008, as a result of a workforce reduction, Teradyne recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million to write off the acquired workforce asset. Restructuring and Other, Net In response to a downturn in the industry, we initiated restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations. The tables below represent activities related to these actions. The remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid in 2009. The remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the long term other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2013. We expect to pay out approximately $2.4 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Our future lease commitments are net of expected sublease income of $7.7 million as of December 31, 2008. We have subleased approximately 64% of our unoccupied space as of December 31, 2008. 2008 Activities FacilityRelated AcquisitionCosts Loss onSale ofLand andBuildings SeveranceandBenefits Long LivedAssetImpairment Total (in thousands) 2008 provision $ 13,748 $ 823 $ 20,883 $ 24,421 $ 550 $ 60,425 Cash payments (951 ) (823 ) (19,079 ) (20,853 ) Accelerated depreciation and other (11,966 ) (20,883 ) (550 ) (33,399 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 831 $ $ $ 5,342 $ $ 6,173 We recorded the following activities related to the 2008 restructuring activities: $24.4 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 470 people; $20.9 million loss on sale of land and buildings, including $22.6 million loss on the sale of real estate across both segments for a manufacturing facility in North Reading, MA as a result of the transfer of manufacturing to an outsourced partner and $1.7 million gain on the sale of real estate in the Semiconductor Test segment for a facility in Agoura Hills, CA; $13.7 million of facility related charges, including $12.0 million of facility charges across both segments related to the accelerated depreciation of a manufacturing facility in North Reading, Massachusetts as a result of the transfer of manufacturing to an outsourced partner; $0.7 million of facility charges across both segments related to the early exit of a facility in Bracknell, UK, $0.7 million of facility charges in the Semiconductor Test segment related to the early exit of a facility in Ontario, Canada and $0.3 million of other miscellaneous charges across both segments mainly related to housing in Japan and Belgium office; 31 $0.8 related to the acquisition financing costs; and $0.6 million charge in the Semiconductor Test segment for a long lived asset impairment related to acquired intangible assets. The restructuring actions taken during the year ended December 31, 2008 are expected to generate quarterly cost savings of approximately $11.2 million across all segments. 2007 Activities Gain on Saleof Landand Buildings SeveranceandBenefits InsuranceRecovery Total (in thousands) 2007 (credit) provision $ (3,597 ) $ 6,963 $ (4,326 ) $ (960 ) Cash receipts (payments) 3,597 (5,855 ) 4,326 2,068 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ $ 1,108 $ $ 1,108 2008 credit (194 ) (194 ) Cash payments (833 ) (833 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ $ 81 $ $ 81 We recorded the following activity related to the 2007 restructuring activities: $3.6 million gain on the sale of land and building in Deerfield, IL; $7.0 million of severance charges related to 202 people across all functions and segments; and $4.3 million of cash proceeds recovered from insurance related to a facility fire in Taiwan. 2006 Activities Gain on Saleof Landand Buildings SeveranceandBenefits FacilityRelated Long LivedAssetImpairment Total (in thousands) 2006 (credit) provision $ (39,098 ) $ 4,292 $ 1,153 $ 50 $ (33,603 ) Cash receipts (payments) 39,098 (2,659 ) (528 ) 35,911 Asset write downs (50 ) (50 ) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 1,633 625 $ 2,258 2007 credit (152 ) (152 ) Cash payments (1,473 ) (590 ) (2,063 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ $ 8 $ 35 $ $ 43 2008 credit (8 ) (8 ) Cash payments (35 ) (35 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ $ $ $ $ We recorded the following activity related to the 2006 restructuring activities: $39.1 million gain on the sale of real estate, including $35.8 million for two Semiconductor Test facilities in Boston, MA, $1.5 million for a Semiconductor Test parking facility in Boston, MA, $1.3 million for a Semiconductor Test facility in San Jose, CA and $0.5 million for buildings in Nashua, NH; $4.3 million of severance charges related to 179 people across all segments; and $1.2 million of facility related charges for the exit of Semiconductor Test facilities in Newbury Park, CA and Waltham, MA. 32 Pre 2006 Activities SeveranceandBenefits Loss on Saleof ProductLines OtherCharges FacilityRelated Total Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 10,116 $ $ 529 $ 17,061 $ 27,706 2006 credit (50 ) (406 ) (1,974 ) (2,430 ) Cash (payments) receipts (8,883 ) 406 (529 ) (5,483 ) (14,489 ) Balance at December 31, 2006 1,183 9,604 10,787 2007 (credit) provision (292 ) (906 ) 1,651 453 Cash (payments) receipts (649 ) 906 (3,488 ) (3,231 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 242 7,767 8,009 2008 (credit) provision (124 ) 2,676 2,552 Cash payments (118 ) (1,971 ) (2,089 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ $ $ $ 8,472 $ 8,472 For pre 2006 restructuring activity, we recorded the following activity in 2008: $2.7 million facility related charge in Systems Test Group segment for changes in the estimated amount and timing of sublease income on a facility in Westford, MA.

The interest income decrease of $5.5 million, from $44.6 million in 2006 to $39.1 million in 2007, was primarily attributable to lower cash balances due to the stock repurchase activity in 2007. The increase in interest expense and other, net of $13.1 million, from $1.1 million in 2007 to $14.2 million in 2008, was due primarily to recognizing other than temporary losses related to marketable securities and realized losses from sales of marketable securities. The decrease in interest expense and other, net of $10.5 million, from $11.6 million in 2006 to $1.1 million in 2007, was due primarily to the repayment of our 3.75% Senior Convertible Notes in the fourth quarter of 2006.

The increase in Corporate from 2006 to 2007 is primarily related to the elimination of our interest expense due to the repayment of our Notes in 2006 and gains from sales of real estate which totaled $3.6 million. Income Taxes The income tax expense from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007 totaled $12.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively. The expense relates primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes. During 2006, the income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $27.9 million. The expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes offset by benefits from a $6.0 million credit related to U.S. pension funding and the settlement of a California income tax audit for 1998 through 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $368.6 million in 2008 from 2007, to $374.3 million. Cash activity for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 2007 2008Change 2006 2007Change Cash provided by operating activities: Income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for non cash items $ 123.7 $ 176.0 $ 283.8 $ (52.3 ) $ (107.8 ) Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired 38.6 (44.2 ) 169.1 82.8 (213.3 ) Cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations 0.8 (3.6 ) (2.8 ) 4.4 (0.8 ) Total cash provided by operating activities $ 163.1 $ 128.2 $ 450.1 $ 34.9 $ (321.9 ) Cash (used for) provided by investing activities for continuing operations (449.1 ) 105.8 196.6 (554.9 ) (90.8 ) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities of discontinued operations 0.0 10.8 (0.4 ) (10.8 ) 11.2 Total cash (used for) provided by investing activities $ (449.1 ) $ 116.6 $ 196.2 $ (565.7 ) $ (79.6 ) Total cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 46.3 $ (250.5 ) $ (419.0 ) $ 296.8 $ 168.5 Total $ (239.7 ) $ (5.7 ) $ 227.3 $ (234.0 ) $ (233.0 ) 34 In 2008, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, provided cash of $38.6 million. This was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.2 million due to a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a decrease in days sales outstanding from 66 days in 2007 to 51 days in 2008, as a result of improved collections. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accruals of $34.4 million and an increase in other assets of $29.9 million. In 2007, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, used cash of $44.2 million. This was due to a number of factors including, an increase in accounts receivable of $33.7 million due to an increase in days sales outstanding from 55 days in 2006 to 66 days in 2007, a reduction of accrued income taxes of $30.9 million due to the payments of 2006 foreign income taxes around the world, and an increase in other assets of $25.0 million primarily related to balances due for inventory provided to our outsourced subcontract manufacturer of $15.7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in our inventory balances due to shorter cycle times with our FLEX products. In 2006, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired, provided cash of $169.1 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable balances of $67.9 million resulting mostly from the decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Additionally, there was a decrease in inventory of $79.3 million due to shorter cycle times with our FLEX products, and an increase of $32.8 million in accrued income taxes due to higher foreign income taxes in 2006 compared to 2005. These providers of cash were partially offset by retirement plan contributions of $30.2 million of which $20.0 million was a contribution to our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Investing activities consist of purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, cash paid for acquisitions of businesses or technology, proceeds from the sale of land and buildings, proceeds from asset and product line disposals, cash paid for purchases of capital assets. In 2008, we completed the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test, for a total cash purchase price and related fees, net of cash acquired, of $574.3 million. In March 2007, we bought an enabling technology from MOSAID Technologies Inc. for a purchase price and related costs totaling $17.6 million. Capital expenditures were $87.2 million in 2008, $86.1 million in 2007 and $110.0 million in 2006. Capital expenditures decreased by $23.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease of internally manufactured systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in Semiconductor Test of approximately $18.1 million. The remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across Teradyne. Proceeds from asset disposals were $61.7 million, $8.8 million and $85.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively and primarily consist of sales of real estate. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $10.8 million of cash in 2007. Included in this balance is the net proceeds we received related to the sale of our Broadband Test Division to Tollgrade in August 2007. Financing activities include proceeds from revolving credit facility, issuance of our common stock, repurchases of our common stock as well as repayments of debt. In November of 2008, we obtained a revolving credit facility that provided net cash of $119.7 million. The credit facility will be available on a revolving basis until November 14, 2011. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance under the credit facility was $122.5 million. We may optionally prepay loans or reduce the credit facility commitments at any time, without penalty. Borrowings under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of Teradyne, currently Nextest and Eagle Test. The obligations of Teradyne and the guarantors are collateralized by (i) all personal property of Teradyne and each guarantor, (ii) all present and future shares of capital stock of (or other ownership or profit interest in) each of Teradynes present and future subsidiaries (limited to 65% of the capital stock of each first tier foreign subsidiary), and (iii) all real property of Teradyne and each guarantor, if the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated indebtedness, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, exceeds 2.5 to 1.0. The credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including the financial measures of a leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and an available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility. 35 During 2008, 2007 and 2006, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans provided cash of $17.8 million, $23.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively. In July 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which was completed in October 2007. In total, $400 million of common stock was repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2006, we repurchased 10.6 million shares of common stock for $137.8 million for an average price per share of $12.98. During 2007, we repurchased 18.3 million shares of common stock for $273.7 million for an average price per share of $14.94. In November 2007, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program, allowing us to spend an aggregate of $400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. During 2008, we repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $91.2 million at an average price of $12.20 per share. In October 2001, we issued $400 million principal amount of the Notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of $389 million. The Notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.00 per share, which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately 38.4615 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. We made annual interest payments of $15 million, paid semi annually, on the Notes commencing on April 15, 2002. During 2004 and 2005, we repurchased $100 million of the outstanding Notes pursuant to authorization from our Board of Directors. The decision to repurchase a portion of the Notes was based on the fair market value of the Notes being below the return we would earn on high grade investment securities. On January 26, 2006, management was given further authorization by our Board to repurchase up to the full $300 million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the Notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon. During 2006, repayments of long term debt and notes payable used cash of $304.6 million. In the first and third quarter of 2006, we repurchased Notes of $15.0 million and $24.0 million, respectively, and we repaid the remaining $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 We operate in a highly cyclical industry and we may experience, with relatively short notice, significant fluctuations in demand for our products. This could result in a material effect on our liquidity position. We expect, based upon our current estimate of our revenue and operating results for fiscal year 2009, that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $374.3 million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months. If our estimates of revenue and operating results for fiscal year 2009 significantly decrease, we could be required to obtain additional financing. However, if financing is necessary, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available or that the terms will be acceptable to us. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings Retirement Plans We adopted the funded status recognition provision of SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006. This standard amends SFAS 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by SFAS 158. The pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31. Our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The largest portion of our 2008 pension expense was $2.8 million for our Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations. Two assumptions: discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of pension plan expense and 36 asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Based on this review, we believe that 7.75% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal year 2008. We will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust the rate as necessary. The current asset allocation for our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 37% invested in equity securities and 63% invested in fixed income securities. Our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations. We base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2008, under the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, we had cumulative losses of approximately $62.5 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on Citigroup Pension Index adjusted for the plans expected cash flows and was 6.2% at December 31, 2008, down from 6.5% at December 31, 2007. We estimate that in 2009 we will recognize approximately $1.1 million of pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. The pension expense estimate for 2009 is based on a 6.2% discount rate, and 7.75% return on Plan assets. Future pension expense or benefit will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans. As of December 31, 2008, we had unrecognized pension losses of $144.6 million, of which $127.3 million is for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. We performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the estimated U.S. Qualified Pension Plan pension expense (benefit) that would have resulted for the year ended December 31, 2008, if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 5.7% 6.2% 6.7% (in millions) 7.25% $ 3.8 $ 2.3 $ 1.2 7.75% 2.5 1.1 0.0 8.25% 1.3 (0.1 ) (1.2 ) The assets of the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has decreased from $254.0 million at December 31, 2007 to $184.5 million at December 31, 2008. Our funding policy is to make contributions to the Pension Plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2008, there were no additional contributions made to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, and we made $4.3 million of additional contributions to certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries. Based upon the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan funded status as of December 31, 2008, we do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in 2009. Contributions that will be made in 2009 to certain Qualified Plans for non U.S. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately $3.1 million. 37 Equity Compensation Plans In addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note O: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006. The 2006 Equity Plan replaces our 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan, our 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and our 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 Equity Plan.

Mr. Tufano ceased being an employee of Solectron or Flextronics in October 2007. In the ordinary course of business, Teradyne has for the last ten years purchased printed circuit board assemblies from Solectron, and has also sold in circuit testers to Solectron which Teradyne refers to as Flextronics. In August 2007, prior to the Flextronics acquisition, we expanded our contract with Solectron to have it provide additional manufacturing and test services, including areas of final configuration and test for most of Teradynes FLEX family of products. In the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we purchased $207.8 million and $229.9 million, respectively, of printed circuit board assemblies and services from Flextronics. Sales of in circuit testers to Flextronics for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $4.0 million and $5.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, $19.8 million was included in accounts payable and $17.5 million was included in accounts receivable, representing amounts due to/from Flextronics. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations. (SFAS No. 141(R)) This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes new principles and requirements for how an acquiring company 1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree, 2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, and 3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations occurring in the fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), the resolution of existing balances related to uncertain tax positions from prior acquisitions that differ from previously recorded amounts will be adjusted through earnings. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. The FSP defers the provisions of SFAS No. 157 with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to initial recognition until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Items in this classification include goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, guarantees and certain other items. The adoption of FSP FAS 157 2 effective January 1, 2009 will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 161), an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 161 expands the current disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, such that entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives; how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the entitys financial position, performance and cash flow. SFAS No. 161 is effective prospectively for periods beginning on or after November 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS No. 161 in fiscal year 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2008 the FASB issued Staff Position No. 142 3 (FSP No. 142 3), Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. This FSP amends the guidance in FASB Statement No. 142 ,Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, about estimating useful lives of recognized intangible assets and requires additional disclosures related to renewing or extending the terms of recognized intangible assets. In estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset, the FSP requires companies to consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements together with the assets intended use, regardless of whether the 40 arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions. The FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The disclosure requirements are to be applied prospectively to all intangible assets. The adoption of FSP No. 142 3 will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in U.S. Treasuries and government agencies. All of our auction rate marketable securities are AAA, AA or A rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a U.S. Department of Education agency or a third party insurer. We place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management We regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the European Euro, Great Britain Pound, Japanese Yen and the Taiwan Dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. We do not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. Our interest rate exposure is primarily in the United States in short term and long term marketable securities. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On these bases, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is $0.6 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 41
