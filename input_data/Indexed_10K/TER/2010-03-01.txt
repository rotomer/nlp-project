Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K which are not historical facts, so called forward looking statements, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in Teradynes filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements which reflect managements analysis only as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward looking statements, except as may be required by law. 21 Overview We design, develop, manufacture, and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics, automotive, computing, telecommunications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our automatic test equipment products and services include: semiconductor test (Semiconductor Test) systems; and military/aerospace (Mil/Aero) test instrumentation and systems, circuit board test and inspection (Commercial Board Test) systems, automotive diagnostic and test (Diagnostic Solutions) systems and hard disk drive test (HDD) systems, collectively these products represent Systems Test Group. We have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), outsourced sub assembly and test providers (OSATs), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs), manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive companies, HDD manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors as well as the United States Department of Defense. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. These cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry. Historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. This was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our Semiconductor Test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy, which has negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry. The sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector. In response to the business downturn, we implemented significant permanent and temporary cost reduction measures. We reduced headcount worldwide, cut capital spending, and imposed temporary salary reductions and furloughs on our workforce. Due to the continued improvement in our business, we removed the temporary salary reductions and furloughs we imposed over the last year. We believe the permanent cost cutting measures we took in the last several quarters will be of long term value. In addition, we believe our acquisitions of Nextest and Eagle Test and our entry into the high speed memory and HDD markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth. We will continue to invest in our business in anticipation of a broader recovery in our markets and to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs. As the fourth quarter of 2009 demonstrated, with our current cost structure, we can achieve significantly higher profitability than we achieved at comparable revenue levels in the past. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, 22 investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. Our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. For multiple element arrangements, we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract. We also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control. Fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Our post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. We defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 20, Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts. Our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. We classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. We generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products. For transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product, revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 985 605, Software Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. 23 For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under ASC 605 35, Revenue Recognition Construction Type and Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification, or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. We record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix, and possible alternative uses. Equity Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provision of ASC 718 10, Stock Compensation, using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of ASC 718 10. Stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after January 1, 2006 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 10. As required by ASC 718 10, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest. The cumulative effect of the initial adoption of ASC 718 10 was not material. Prior to the adoption of ASC 718 10, we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 (APB 25). On May 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding, unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers, and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time. The stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of $13.26, the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005, and ranged in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. As a result of the vesting acceleration, options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately, and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under ASC 718 10 by approximately $48.6 million in the aggregate, on a pre tax basis, over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of this review, undertaken at December 31, 2002, we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions, most notably the United States. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, we have maintained our valuation allowance at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 24 Investments We account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320 10, Investments Debt and Equity Securities. On a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include: The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; and The intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We determined that we did not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an other than temporary impairment loss in the amount of $0.7 million and $11.0 million, in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted ASC 820 10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for financial assets and liabilities. As defined in ASC 820 10, fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. We use the market and income approach techniques to value our financial instruments. ASC 820 10 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly as of the reporting date. For example, a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices, and therefore is considered a Level 2 input. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available, which might include Teradynes own data. As a result of our November 14, 2008 acquisition of Eagle Test, we acquired $26.5 million of auction rate securities (ARS) at fair value ($30.0 million par value). In addition, we acquired (1) the right (UBS Put) to sell our ARS back to UBS at par plus interest, at our sole discretion, during a two year period beginning on June 30, 2010, and (2) received an option to borrow up to 75% of the fair value of the ARS at no cost. Beginning in February 2008 and continuing through December 31, 2009, the majority of the securities in our acquired ARS portfolio have experienced failed auctions, resulting in inability to sell these securities. Consequently, as set forth in the trust indentures, the coupon rate resets to a contractual rate which may not equal the current market rate. A failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not necessarily represent a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer. All of our ARS are AAA, AA or A rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a U.S. Department of Education agency or a third party insurer. At December 31, 2009, the underlying securities for the ARS have remaining maturities ranging from five to thirty years. Substantially all of these securities are collateralized by student loans. Because the UBS Put is expected to allow us to sell our ARS securities at par within a relatively short time period and provides UBS with the ability to require us to sell the securities to them at any time between acceptance of the UBS Put through July 2012, we do not anticipate holding these investments to the earlier of maturity or redemption by the issuer. We intend to exercise the UBS Put and require UBS to repurchase our ARS at par at the earliest possible time, June 2010. As a result, as of the Eagle Test acquisition date (November 14, 25 2008), we classified the ARS as trading securities under ASC 320 10. During 2009, we recorded a net gain of $0.7 million in interest income and during 2008 we recorded a loss of $0.5 million, in interest expense and other, in our consolidated statement of operations for the changes in the ARS fair value. In determining the fair value of our ARS and other investments, we utilize the provisions of ASC 820 10. In determining the value of our ARS as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model with the major inputs to such model based on our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing these instruments. Specifically, we used the following key inputs to our valuation model as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: Term we estimated a four to five year expected life of the instruments, based on our expectations of the most likely time in which it would take for the instruments to be called by the issuer or liquidity to be restored to the market place. Probability of Default we determined the probability of default using market credit spreads. Discount Rate we determined the discount rate based on estimated yields of similar publicly traded instruments (e.g., similar collateral, terms, credit quality, etc.). Liquidity Risk Premium given the recent instability in the financial markets and the low demand for auction rate securities, it is unclear as to when these securities will become liquid again. Without the auction process functioning again, it would be extremely difficult to estimate the expected holding period for these instruments. As a result, we included a 400 to 600 basis point premium to the discount rate to reflect the illiquidity of these bonds. Based on these key inputs, we estimated the fair value of our ARS portfolio at $23.6 million and $26.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On November 14, 2008, we recognized the UBS Put as an asset measured at a fair value of $2.7 million. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of the UBS Put was $2.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively. We recorded a $0.5 million loss in interest expense during 2009 for the decrease in the fair value of the UBS Put and a $0.6 million gain in interest income during 2008 for an increase in the fair value. In determining the fair value of the UBS Put as of December 31, 2009, we assumed we would redeem the auction rate securities at par at the earliest possible time, June 30, 2010. We utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the UBS Put using the following assumptions: (1) a time period of 0.5 years, representing the period from December 31, 2009 to the earliest date we can expect to be able to redeem the UBS Put (June 30, 2010) and (2) a discount rate of 0.85%, which included a spread based on the credit default swap of UBS in order to account for the credit risk of UBS. As of December 31, 2008, the following assumptions were used: (1) a time period of 1.5 years and (2) a discount rate of 3.79%. We have elected fair value treatment for the UBS Put under ASC 825 10, Financial Instruments. The UBS Put is the only instrument of this nature or type that we hold and for which we have elected the fair value option under ASC 825 10. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets, and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit 26 basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. We considered the significant adverse change in the business climate for our products at the end of 2008 a triggering event for testing the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets. Based upon a review of the operations and activities associated with our long lived assets, we determined that our long lived assets should be grouped with other assets and liabilities and identified four asset groups (System on a Chip/High Speed Memory, Nextest, Eagle Test and Assembly Test) that resulted in the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We identified developed technology as the primary asset for the Nextest and Eagle Test asset groups, test system fixed assets as the primary asset for the System on a Chip/High Speed Memory asset group, and fixed assets as the primary asset for the Assembly Test asset group. We tested the recoverability of our asset groups by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to the asset groups carrying amount. The projections utilized in the undiscounted cash flows to test the recoverability of the asset groups were consistent with the underlying projections utilized in our 2008 goodwill impairment evaluation, except that the undiscounted cash flows included only the future cash flows directly associated with the direct use and eventual disposition of the asset group. The sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the asset groups and, as a result, the carrying amount of asset groups was deemed recoverable. As a result, no impairment loss was recognized. 27 SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Percentage of net revenue: Net revenue: Products 72.7 % 75.5 % 78.2 % Services 27.3 24.5 21.8 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of products 47.2 40.8 39.0 Cost of services 14.8 14.2 14.4 Total cost of revenue 62.0 55.0 53.4 Gross profit 38.0 45.0 46.6 Operating expenses: Engineering and development 20.1 19.6 18.6 Selling and administrative 24.5 22.4 22.5 Acquired intangible assets amortization 3.9 1.9 0.3 In process research and development 0.1 1.5 Restructuring and other, net 4.5 5.6 (0.1 ) Goodwill impairment 29.8 Total operating expenses 53.0 79.4 42.8 Interest and other, net (2.4 ) (0.2 ) 3.4 (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes (17.4 ) (34.6 ) 7.2 (Benefit) Provision for income taxes (1.1 ) 1.1 0.7 (Loss) income from continuing operations (16.3 )% (35.7 )% 6.5 % Results of Operations Discontinued Operations On August 1, 2007, we completed the sale of the Broadband Test Division to Tollgrade Communications, Inc. for $11.3 million in cash. Broadband Test Division had revenues for the seven month period ended July 31, 2007 of $11.2 million. Loss from discontinued operations of our Broadband Test Division for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $6.3 million. In 2007, we recorded a gain on the sale of Broadband Test Division of $5.9 million, net of a tax provision of $0.4 million. In accordance with ASC 360 10, we are reporting Broadband Test Division as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless indicated otherwise, the discussion and amounts provided in this Results of Operations section and elsewhere in this Form 10 K relate to continuing operations only. Book to Bill Ratio Book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales. Book to bill ratio by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Semiconductor Test 1.3 0.7 1.1 Systems Test Group 0.6 1.5 1.2 Total Company 1.1 0.9 1.1 28 Revenues Net revenues for our two reportable segments were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009DollarChange 2007 2008DollarChange (in millions) Semiconductor Test $ 552.4 $ 900.3 $ 876.5 $ (347.9 ) $ 23.8 Systems Test Group 267.0 206.7 225.8 60.3 (19.1 ) $ 819.4 $ 1,107.0 $ 1,102.3 $ (287.6 ) $ 4.7 Semiconductor Test revenue decreased $347.9 million or approximately 39% from 2008 to 2009, due to excess test capacity at our customers as a result of the global economic downturn. The Eagle Test acquisition which was completed in November of 2008 added $61.0 million of revenue in 2009 compared to $2.5 million in 2008. Semiconductor Test revenue increased $23.8 million or approximately 3% from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to $79.4 million of sales from our Nextest acquisition partially offset by lower sales due to decreased demand related to SOC device units growing at a lower rate in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in Systems Test Group revenue of $60.3 million or approximately 29% from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to sales of Hard Disk Drive test systems, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Board Test and Diagnostic Solutions sales, while Mil/Aero product and service sales remained flat. Systems Test Group revenue decreased $19.1 million or approximately 8% from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to a lower Mil/Aero board test program related sales. Our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2009 2008 2007 Semiconductor Test 67 % 81 % 80 % Systems Test Group 33 19 20 100 % 100 % 100 % Net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 United States 26 % 22 % 23 % Taiwan 14 18 13 Malaysia 11 6 7 South East Asia 10 10 8 Europe 10 10 12 Thailand 9 3 1 Singapore 8 10 15 Japan 6 11 12 Korea 5 7 6 Rest of the World 1 3 3 100 % 100 % 100 % The breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009DollarChange 2007 2008DollarChange (in millions) Product Revenue $ 595.3 $ 836.0 $ 861.6 $ (240.7 ) $ (25.6 ) Service Revenue 224.1 271.0 240.7 (46.9 ) 30.3 $ 819.4 $ 1,107.0 $ 1,102.3 $ (287.6 ) $ 4.7 29 Our product revenue decreased $240.7 million or 29% in 2009 from 2008 due to lower sales across all Semiconductor Test, Commercial Board Test and Diagnostic Solutions products as a result of excess test capacity at our customers due to the global economic downturn. The decrease was partially offset by sales of Hard Disk Drive test systems. The Eagle Test acquisition which was completed in November of 2008 added $52.6 million of product revenue in 2009. Service revenue, which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales, and applications support, decreased $46.9 million or 17% due to the global economic downturn. Our product revenue decreased $25.6 million or 3% in 2008 from 2007 due to decreased demand. Service revenue increased $30.3 million or 13% due to a larger installed base. In 2009, revenues from one customer accounted for approximately 12% of total revenue. In 2008 and 2007, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 26%, 14%, and 16% of consolidated net revenue, respectively.

This decrease in gross profit was the result of a decrease of 5.2 points due to lower product sales volume, a decrease of 4.1 points related to higher product revenue as a percentage of total revenue, which included the growth of Hard Disk Drive test system revenues, and a decrease of 1.5 points for a charge to adjust Eagle Test acquired inventory to fair value. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 3.8 points primarily from lower operations spending due to workforce reductions and lower freight and warranty charges, which were the result of lower product sales. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2007 to 2008 by 1.6 percentage points. A decrease of 2.5 points was due to a $27.6 million increase in provision for excess inventory recorded as a result of the significant decrease in forecasted semiconductor demand coupled with a product transition; this decrease was partially offset by improved service margins in our Semiconductor Test group. The breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009Dollar /PointChange 2007 2008Dollar /PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Profit $ 208.5 $ 384.8 $ 431.1 $ (176.3 ) $ (46.3 ) Percent of Product Revenue 35.0 % 46.0 % 50.0 % (11.0 ) (4.0 ) Service Gross Profit $ 103.1 $ 113.4 $ 82.3 $ (10.3 ) $ 31.1 Percent of Service Revenue 46.0 % 41.8 % 34.2 % 4.2 7.6 We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. 30 During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an inventory provision of $28.0 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors: Downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels as a result of worsening economic conditions experienced in the semiconductor and automotive industries primarily in the first half of 2009 resulted in an inventory provision of $16.7 million for inventory not expected to be consumed; A decline in demand versus forecast for our Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) test product due to the global economic downturn, lower product pricing by competitors, the introduction of a new product by a competitor and consolidation among a number of the expected buyers of the product, resulted in an inventory provision of $8.6 million; and During late 2008, we introduced the next versions of our Nextest Magnum memory test product. At that time, it was anticipated that demand would continue for the existing version of the product within its installed base of customers. An overall decline in the memory market combined with a portion of our customers accelerating their purchasing of the newer version of the product resulted in an inventory provision of $2.7 million. Of the $28.0 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2009, $20.3 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $7.7 million was related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an inventory provision of $29.4 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors: In the third quarter of 2008, we recorded an inventory provision of $20.2 million related to wireless instrumentation associated with our Semiconductor Test segments FLEX Test Platform. In the first half of 2008, there had been a significant increase in demand for our wireless instrumentation. In the third quarter of 2008, this wireless instrumentation demand decreased abruptly causing a reduction in forecasted demand. This significant decrease in demand combined with an upcoming wireless instrumentation product transition resulted in an inventory write down of $20.2 million; and The remainder of the charge of $9.2 million primarily reflects downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels as a result of worsening economic conditions experienced in the semiconductor test industry at the end of 2008. Of the $29.4 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2008, $24.9 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $4.5 million was related to Systems Test Group. The provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.8 million. Of the $1.8 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded, $0.5 million related to Semiconductor Test and $1.3 million related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we scrapped $31.6 million, $9.8 million and $33.5 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $4.3 million, $2.4 million and $1.1 million of previously written down or written off inventory, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written down or written off totaling $129.7 million. We have no pre determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory. 31 Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009Change 2007 2008Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 164.8 $ 216.5 $ 204.3 $ (51.7 ) $ 12.2 Percent of Total Revenue 20.1 % 19.6 % 18.6 % The decrease of $51.7 million in engineering and development expenses from 2008 to 2009 was mainly due to a $54.9 million decrease in spending as a result of workforce reductions and lower project spending and a $6.2 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions. This decrease was partially offset by additional costs of $9.4 million related to the acquisition of Eagle Test. The increase of $12.2 million in engineering and development expenses from 2007 to 2008 was mainly due to an increase of $10.3 million in spending related to investments in adjacent markets, an increase of $12.9 million due to the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test, partially offset by a decrease in other Semiconductor Test spending primarily related to headcount reduction of $8.3 million and lower variable employee compensation of $2.8 million. Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009Change 2007 2008Change (dollars in millions) Selling and Administrative $ 200.4 $ 247.8 $ 248.1 $ (47.4 ) $ (0.3 ) Percent of Total Revenue 24.5 % 22.4 % 22.5 % The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $47.4 million from 2008 to 2009 is due primarily to a $57.3 million decrease from workforce reductions and on going cost reduction initiatives and a $9.9 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions, partially offset by additional costs of $19.8 million related to the acquisition of Eagle Test. The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $0.3 million from 2007 to 2008 consists primarily of the following: $14.7 million decrease due to lower labor costs from reductions in headcount, $7.0 million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation, partially offset by $18.5 million increase due to the acquisition of Nextest and $3.0 million increase related to the acquisition of Eagle Test. Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization Acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009Change 2007 2008Change (dollars in millions) Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization $ 32.3 $ 20.6 $ 3.7 $ 11.7 $ 16.9 Percent of Total Revenue 3.9 % 1.9 % 0.3 % Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2008 to 2009 due to the Eagle Test acquisition which was completed in November of 2008. Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2007 to 2008 due to the acquisitions of Nextest and Eagle Test. 32 Goodwill Impairment In 2008, we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $329.7 million. We experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of 2008. This sharp decline led to a non cash impairment of our goodwill of $329.7 million as of December 31, 2008. In process Research and Development In 2008, we recorded an expense of $1.6 million related to in process research and development related to the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test. On March 7, 2007, we purchased in process enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from MOSAID Technologies Inc. for $17.6 million, which includes $0.6 million in fees directly related to the acquisition. Of the purchase price, $16.7 million has been allocated to in process research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations. The balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets. In the year ended December 31, 2008, as a result of a workforce reduction, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.6 million to write off the acquired workforce asset. Restructuring and Other Restructuring In response to a downturn in the industry, we implemented restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs, principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations. The remaining accrual for severance and benefits of $2.9 million is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The remaining accrual for lease payments of $10.5 million on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the long term other accrued liabilities account, and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2013. We expect to pay approximately $3.5 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Our future lease commitments, as of December 31, 2009, are net of expected sublease income of $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have subleased approximately 54% of our unoccupied space. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $37.9 million related to 2009 activities, as part of ongoing efforts to lower expenses and our cost structure in light of the industry wide decline in orders for semiconductor equipment, and a credit of $(0.4) million due to a change in sublease income estimate related to Q208 activity. The restructuring charges (credit) recorded in 2009 consisted of the following activities: Q1 2009 Activity: $17.6 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 518 people, of which $14.9 million and 460 people were in Semiconductor Test, $1.9 million and 42 people were in Systems Test Group, and $0.8 million and 16 people were in Corporate. Q2 2009 Activity: $15.9 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 316 people, of which $11.4 million and 267 people were in Semiconductor Test, $3.0 million and 25 people were in Corporate, and $1.5 million and 24 people were in Systems Test Group. Q3 2009 Activity: $4.1 million of charges in Corporate related to the early exit of a leased facility in North Reading; and $0.3 million of charges in Systems Test Group related to the early exit of a leased facility in Novi, Michigan. 33 Q2 2008 Activity: $(0.4) million credit in Semiconductor Test segment for a revision in estimated sublease income at an exited leased facility in Ontario, Canada. The restructuring actions taken during the year ended December 31, 2009 are expected to generate quarterly cost savings of approximately $14.8 million in Semiconductor Test, $1.4 million in Systems Test Group, and $0.7 million in Corporate. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $25.8 million related to 2008 activities, mainly due to the continuation of the cost down and improved productivity efforts, the consolidation of field operations, and lowering our service infrastructure. We also recorded an additional charge of $2.7 million due to a change in sublease income estimate related to Pre 2007 activity. The restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consisted of the following activities: Q1 2008 Activity: $7.4 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 148 people, of which $6.3 million and 126 people were in Semiconductor Test, and $1.1 million and 22 people were in Systems Test Group; and $0.7 million of facility charges in Semiconductor Test related to the early exit of a leased facility in Bracknell, United Kingdom. Q2 2008 Activity: $8.1 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 132 people, of which $7.3 million and 112 people were in Semiconductor Test, and $0.8 million and 20 people were in Corporate; and $0.7 million of facility charges in the Semiconductor Test related to the early exit of a leased facility in Ontario, Canada. Q4 2008 Activity: $8.9 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 190 people, of which $7.4 million and 149 people were in Semiconductor Test, $0.8 million and 21 people were in Systems Test Group, and $0.7 million and 20 people were in Corporate. Pre 2007 Activity: $2.7 million charge in Systems Test Group for a revision in estimated sublease income at a facility in Westford, Massachusetts. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $7.0 million related to 2007 activities, primarily due to the transition of our manufacturing processes, including board assembly, electro mechanical integration and final configuration and test for the FLEX product to the outsourced provider in China, in an effort to achieve lower material costs, more efficient manufacturing and lower shipping costs. We also recorded an additional net charge of $1.2 million for a change in estimates related to Pre 2007 activities. The restructuring charges recorded in 2007 consisted of the following activities: Q1 2007 Activity: $2.5 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 38 people, of which $1.0 million and 10 people were in Semiconductor Test, $1.0 million and 21 people were in Systems Test Group, and $0.5 million and 7 people were in Corporate. 34 Q2 2007 Activity: $1.7 million of severance charges across all functions in Semiconductor Test related to headcount reductions of approximately 101 people. Q3 2007 Activity: $2.8 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 63 people, of which $1.5 million and 25 people were in Semiconductor Test, and $1.3 million and 38 people were in Systems Test Group. Pre 2007 Activity: $1.7 million charge in Systems Test Group for a revision in estimated sublease income at a facility in Westford, Massachusetts; and $(0.5) million related to change in the estimated amount of benefits payments related to pre 2007 headcount reduction activities across both segments. Other During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $(1.0) million of other net credits related to the following: $1.1 million of long lived asset impairment charges across both segments primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets as a result of the consolidation of our facilities in North Reading, Massachusetts; $(2.0) million of credits related to finalization of certain Eagle Test purchase accounting items; and $(0.1) million related to other miscellaneous. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $34.3 million of other charges related to the following: $20.9 million loss on sale of land and buildings, including $22.6 million loss on the sale of real estate across both segments for a manufacturing facility in North Reading, Massachusetts as a result of the transfer of manufacturing to an outsourced partner and $1.7 million gain on the sale of real estate in the Semiconductor Test segment for a facility in Agoura Hills, California; $12.0 million of facility charges across both segments related to the accelerated depreciation of a manufacturing facility in North Reading, Massachusetts as a result of the transfer of manufacturing to an outsourced partner; $0.8 related to acquisition financing costs; and $0.6 million charge in the Semiconductor Test segment for a long lived asset impairment related to acquired intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $(8.8) million of other credits related to the following: $(3.6) million related to the gain on sale of land and building in Deerfield, Illinois; $(4.3) million related to cash proceeds recovered from insurance related to a facility fire in Taiwan; and $(0.9) million related to gain on sale of product lines. 35 Interest and Other 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009Change 2007 2008Change (in millions) Interest income $ 3.4 $ 12.6 $ 39.1 $ (9.2 ) $ (26.5 ) Interest expense and other $ (23.6 ) $ (14.2 ) $ (1.1 ) $ (9.4 ) $ (13.1 ) Interest income decreased by $9.2 million, from $12.6 million in 2008 to $3.4 million in 2009, due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions of Nextest and Eagle Test and lower interest rates. Interest income decreased by $26.5 million, from $39.1 million in 2007 to $12.6 million in 2008, due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions of Nextest and Eagle Test and stock repurchase activity. Interest expense and other increased by $9.4 million, from $14.2 million in 2008 to $23.6 million in 2009, due primarily to the following: $13.9 million of interest expense related to our convertible senior notes, $2.5 million related to the write off of the remaining revolving credit facility debt issue costs due to the termination of our revolving credit facility agreement, an increase of $1.2 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility, partially offset by a decrease of $12.6 million in losses on marketable securities. In 2008, interest expense and other included $2.8 million for the gain on sale of an equity investment and a $1.3 million life insurance gain.

The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 and increased restructuring and other costs in 2008 compared to 2007. Income Taxes The income tax benefit from continuing operations of $8.8 million for 2009 was primarily due to federal net operating loss carryback claims. The income tax expense from continuing operations for 2008 and 2007 of $12.6 and $7.4 million, respectively, related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes. 36 Contractual Obligations The following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period PurchaseObligations Non cancelableLeaseCommitments (1) Debt Intereston Debt PensionContributions Total 2010 $ 131,650 $ 19,155 $ 2,156 $ 8,677 $ 9,834 $ 171,472 2011 16,317 2,156 8,647 27,120 2012 12,629 2,156 8,618 23,403 2013 7,395 2,156 8,587 18,138 2014 5,171 191,078 4,306 200,555 Beyond 2014 5,672 5,672 Total $ 131,650 $ 66,339 $ 199,702 $ 38,835 $ 9,834 $ 446,360 (1) Non cancelable lease payments have not been reduced by sublease income of $5.8 million due in the future under non cancelable sublease agreements. (2) As of December 31, 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest, net of the federal benefit, was $12.8 million and $13.9 million, respectively, and was included in current and long term other accrued liabilities. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement will occur with tax authorities as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $144.5 million in 2009 from 2008 to $518.8 million. Cash activity for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 2008 2009Change 2007 2008Change Cash provided by operating activities: Income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for non cash items $ 42.8 $ 124.5 $ 175.8 $ (81.7 ) $ (51.3 ) Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired 78.5 38.6 (44.2 ) 39.9 82.8 Cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations 0.8 (3.6 ) (0.8 ) 4.4 Total cash provided by operating activities $ 121.3 $ 163.9 $ 128.0 $ (42.6 ) $ 35.9 Cash (used for) provided by investing activities for continuing operations (93.9 ) (449.1 ) 105.8 355.2 (554.9 ) Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations 10.8 (10.8 ) Total cash (used for) provided by investing activities $ (93.9 ) $ (449.1 ) $ 116.6 $ 355.2 $ (565.7 ) Total cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 66.1 $ 46.3 $ (250.5 ) $ 19.8 $ 296.8 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 0.5 (0.8 ) 0.2 1.3 (1.0 ) Total $ 94.0 $ (239.7 ) $ (5.7 ) $ 333.7 $ (234.0 ) 37 In 2009, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired, provided cash of $78.5 million. This was due to a decrease in operating assets of $47.1 million and an increase in operating liabilities of $31.4 million. The decrease in operating assets consisted mainly of a decrease in inventory of $63.4 million partially offset by an increase of $15.6 million in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume. The increase in operating liabilities consisted of an increase in advanced customer payments, accounts payable, deferred revenue and other accrued expenses of $46.7 million partially offset by retirement plan contributions of $15.3 million. The $46.4 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances in 2009 is due to an advanced payment of approximately $68.2 million received from one of our Semiconductor Test customers. The customer received an incremental discount and also wanted to secure its position in our manufacturing slot plan. This increase in customer advances was partially offset by a $21.8 million decrease in deferred revenue. Investing activities in 2009 used cash of $93.9 million due to investments in property, plant and equipment of $41.9 million, payment of transaction fees related to the Eagle Test acquisition of $3.7 million, and purchases of marketable securities of $90.4 million, partially offset by sales of marketable securities that provided cash of $41.0 million, and proceeds from life insurance policies that provided cash of $1.1 million. During 2009, financing activities provided cash of $66.1 million due to approximately $163.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes, $10.0 million of long term debt proceeds from a loan in Japan, and $15.7 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans. These increases were partially offset by $122.5 million of cash used for the repayment of our revolving credit facility and $1.1 million of cash used for principal payment on long term debt. On April 6, 2009, we completed a registered public offering of $190.0 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes (Notes) and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately $163.0 million as a result of these financing transactions. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, payable semi annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The first interest payment was on September 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted. The Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, at an initial conversion rate of approximately 182.65 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.48. The convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately $7.67 per share of our common stock, representing a 75% conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on March 31, 2009. We may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity. Holders of the Notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the Company. In 2008, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired, provided cash of $38.6 million. This was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.2 million as a result of a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2008, and a decrease in days sales outstanding from 66 days in 2007 to 51 days in 2008, as a result of improved collections. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accruals of $31.6 million and an increase in other assets of $32.7 million. 38 In 2007, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired, used cash of $44.2 million. This was due to a number of factors including, an increase in accounts receivable of $33.7 million due to an increase in days sales outstanding from 55 days in 2006 to 66 days in 2007, a reduction of accrued income taxes of $30.9 million due to the payments of 2006 foreign income taxes around the world, and an increase in other assets of $25.0 million primarily related to balances due for inventory provided to our outsourced subcontract manufacturer of $15.7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in our inventory balances due to shorter cycle times for our FLEX products. In 2008, investing activities used cash of $449.1 million, and in 2007, investing activities provided cash of $116.6 million. In 2008, we completed the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test, for a total cash purchase price and related fees, net of cash acquired of $574.3 million. In March 2007, we bought an enabling technology from MOSAID Technologies Inc. for a purchase price and related costs totaling $17.6 million. Capital expenditures were $87.2 million in 2008 and $86.1 million in 2007. Proceeds from asset disposals were $61.7 million and $8.8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and primarily consisted of sales of real estate. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $10.8 million of cash in 2007. Included in this balance are the net proceeds we received related to the sale of our Broadband Test Division to Tollgrade Communications, Inc. in August 2007. In 2008, financing activities provided cash of $46.3 million, and in 2007, financing activities used cash of $250.5 million. In November of 2008, we obtained a revolving credit facility that provided net cash of $119.7 million. The credit facility had a three year term that was to end on November 14, 2011. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance under the credit facility was $122.5 million. The credit facility contained customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including the financial measures of a leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, and an available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility. On April 7, 2009, we repaid and terminated our revolving credit facility agreement. We used approximately $123.3 million of the net proceeds of the convertible senior notes transaction to repay $122.5 million of principal and $0.8 million of accrued interest outstanding under the revolving credit facility agreement. During 2008 and 2007, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans provided cash of $17.8 million and $23.2 million, respectively. In July 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which was completed in October 2007. In total, $400.0 million of common stock was repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2007, we repurchased 18.3 million shares of common stock for $273.7 million for an average price per share of $14.94. In November 2007, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program, allowing us to spend an aggregate of $400.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. During 2008, we repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $91.2 million at an average price of $12.20 per share. As of November 4, 2008, the Board of Directors suspended the stock repurchase program. We operate in a highly cyclical industry and we may experience, with relatively short notice, significant fluctuations in demand for our products. This could result in a material effect on our liquidity position. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $518.8 million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans We adopted the funded status recognition provision of ASC 715 20, Compensation Retirement Benefits Defined Benefit Plans effective December 31, 2006. ASC 715 20 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by ASC 715 20. The pension asset or liability 39 represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31. Our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries, and a Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $9.0 million, including a settlement charge of $1.6 million and a curtailment gain of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The largest portion of our 2009 pension expense was $2.8 million for our Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations. Discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. In developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Based on this review, we believe that 7.75% was an appropriate rate to use for 2009. We will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust the rate as necessary. The current asset allocation for our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is 46.0% invested in equity securities, 42.6% invested in fixed income securities, and 11.4% invested in other securities. Our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations. We base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2009, under the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, we had cumulative losses of approximately $34.7 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Index adjusted for the Plans expected cash flows and was 5.85% at December 31, 2009, down from 6.2% at December 31, 2008. We estimate that in 2010 we will recognize approximately $3.3 million of pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. The pension expense estimate for 2010 is based on a 5.85% discount rate, and 7.5% return on Plan assets. Future pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans. As of December 31, 2009, we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of $136.6 million, of which $120.7 million is for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. We performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the potential change in our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan expense for the year ending December 31, 2010, that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 5.35% 5.85% 6.35% (in millions) 7.0% $ 5.5 $ 4.5 $ 3.3 7.5% 4.3 3.3 2.1 8.0% 3.0 2.0 0.9 The assets of the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. The value of our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan assets has increased from $184.5 million at December 31, 2008 to 40 $217.1 million at December 31, 2009. Our funding policy is to make contributions to the Pension Plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2009, we made a discretionary contribution of $7.5 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan, $1.5 million contribution to the U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Pension Plan and $3.4 million contribution to certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries. On February 18, 2010, we made a discretionary contribution of $5.0 million to the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan and we expect to contribute approximately $1.5 million to the U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Pension Plan in 2010. Contributions that will be made in 2010 to certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately $3.3 million. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note N: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006. The 2006 Equity Plan replaced our 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan, our 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and our 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 Equity Plan. We may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans, but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise, vesting or expiration, as applicable. At our annual meeting of stockholders held May 28, 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 22.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 25.4 million shares issuable thereunder.

The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to motivate employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan as of December 31, 2009 was 12,652,940 shares of our common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock based awards in the form of (1) non qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock based awards. Awards may be tied to time based vesting schedules and or performance based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the 2006 Equity Plan. Awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of Teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. The maximum number of shares of stock based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan will expire on May 24, 2016. In 2009, we granted restricted stock units to employees and directors and restricted stock units and stock options to executive officers. In 2008, we only issued restricted stock unit awards to our employees, executive officers and directors. As of December 31, 2009, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested awards and options totaled $38.8 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. 42 Performance Graph The following graph compares the change in our cumulative total shareholder return in our common stock with the Standard & Poors 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology 500 Index.

Related Party Transaction During 2007, Paul Tufano, a member of our Board of Directors, was Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Solectron Corporation until it was acquired by Flextronics in October 2007. Mr. Tufano ceased being an employee of Solectron or Flextronics in October 2007. In the ordinary course of business, we have for the last ten years purchased printed circuit board assemblies from Solectron, and have also sold in circuit testers to Solectron which we refer to as Flextronics. In August 2007, prior to the Flextronics acquisition, we expanded our contract with Solectron to have it provide additional manufacturing and test services, including areas of final configuration and test for most of our FLEX family of products. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we purchased $207.8 million of printed circuit board assemblies and services from Flextronics. Sales of in circuit testers to Flextronics for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $4.0 million. 43 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC 605 25, Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements. This ASC establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities. This ASC provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The amendments in this ASC also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendors multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The amendments in this ASC are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early application is permitted. We have chosen to early adopt this ASC as of January 1, 2010. Adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC 985 605, Software Revenue Recognition. This ASC changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality, and scopes these products out of current software revenue guidance. The new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality. The amendments will now subject software enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The amendments in this ASC are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early application is permitted. We have chosen to early adopt this ASC as of January 1, 2010. Adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in U.S. Treasuries and government agencies. All of our auction rate marketable securities are AAA, AA or A rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a U.S. Department of Education agency or a third party insurer. Our fixed income available for sale marketable securities purchased during 2009 and held as of December 31, 2009 have a minimum rating of AA by one or more of the major credit rating agencies. We place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management We regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and the Taiwan Dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year. These contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. We do not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 44 Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. Our interest rate exposure is primarily in the United States in short term and long term marketable securities. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. On these bases, the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of December 31, 2009 and $0.6 million as of December 31, 2008. 45
