Overview We are a leading global supplier of automatic test equipment. We design, develop, manufacture, and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics, automotive, computing, telecommunications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our automatic test equipment products and services include: semiconductor test (Semiconductor Test) systems; and military/aerospace (Mil/Aero) test instrumentation and systems, hard disk drive test (HDD) systems, circuit board test and inspection (Commercial Board Test) systems and automotive diagnostic and test (Diagnostic Solutions) systems, collectively these products represent Systems Test Group. 20 Table of Contents We have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), outsourced sub assembly and test providers (OSATs), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs), manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive companies, HDD manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors as well as the United States Department of Defense. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. These cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry. Historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. This was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our Semiconductor Test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy, which negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry. The sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, we experienced improvement in our Semiconductor Test business. We believe our acquisitions of Nextest and Eagle Test and our entry into the high speed memory and HDD markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth. We will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs. As 2010 demonstrated, with our current cost structure, we can achieve significantly higher profitability than we achieved at comparable revenue levels in the past. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, deferred tax assets, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing non software and software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance. In October 2009, the FASB also amended the accounting standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of 2010 on a prospective basis. Adoption had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations in 2010. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and 21 Table of Contents collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. Our equipment has non software and software components that function together to deliver the equipments essential functionality. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. We also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), (ii) third party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (BESP). For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control. Our post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. We defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 20, Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts. Our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. We classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. We generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products. For transactions involving the sale of software, revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 985 605, Software Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under ASC 605 35, Revenue Recognition Construction Type and Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification, or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. 22 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. We record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix, and possible alternative uses. Equity Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans Stock based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 10. As required by ASC 718 10, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest. On May 26, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding, unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees, officers, and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time. The stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of $13.26, the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005, and ranged in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. As a result of the vesting acceleration, options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately, and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under ASC 718 10 by approximately $48.6 million in the aggregate, on a pre tax basis, over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of this review, undertaken at December 31, 2002, we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions, most notably the United States. Due to the continued uncertainty of realization, we have maintained our valuation allowance at December 31, 2010 and 2009. We will assess the level of the valuation allowance required in future periods. Should more positive than negative evidence regarding the realizability of tax attributes exist in a future period, the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated altogether. Reduction of the valuation allowance, in whole or in part, would result in a non cash income tax benefit during the period of reduction. Investments We account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320 10, Investments Debt and Equity Securities. On a quarterly basis, we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include: The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; and The intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We determined that we did not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an other than temporary impairment loss in the amount of $0.7 million and $11.0 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities. 23 Table of Contents As a result of our November 14, 2008 acquisition of Eagle Test, we acquired $26.5 million of auction rate securities (ARS) at fair value ($30.0 million par value). In addition, we acquired (1) the right (UBS Put) to sell our ARS back to UBS at par plus interest, at our sole discretion, during a two year period beginning on June 30, 2010, and (2) received an option to borrow up to 75% of the fair value of the ARS at no cost. We classified the ARS as trading securities under ASC 320 10. The ARS portfolio was repurchased by UBS in 2010 and we no longer own any ARS securities. On November 14, 2008, we also recognized the UBS Put as an asset measured at a fair value of $2.7 million. The UBS Put was exercised in June 2010. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the UBS Put was $2.8 million. During 2009, we recorded a $0.5 million loss in interest expense for the decrease in the fair value of the UBS Put. During 2008, we recorded $0.6 million gain in interest income for an increase in the fair value. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets, and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. We considered the significant adverse change in the business climate for our products at the end of 2008 a triggering event for testing the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets. Based upon a review of the operations and activities associated with our long lived assets, we determined that our long lived assets should be grouped with other assets and liabilities and identified four asset groups (System on a Chip/High Speed Memory, Nextest, Eagle Test and Assembly Test) that resulted in the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We identified developed technology as the primary asset for the Nextest and Eagle Test asset groups, test system fixed assets as the primary asset for the System on a Chip/High Speed Memory asset group, and fixed assets as the primary asset for the Assembly Test asset group. We tested the recoverability of our asset groups by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to the asset groups carrying amount. The projections utilized in the undiscounted cash flows to test the recoverability of the asset groups were consistent with the underlying projections utilized in our 2008 goodwill impairment evaluation, except that the undiscounted cash flows included only the future cash flows directly associated with the direct use and eventual disposition of the asset group. The sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the asset groups and, as a result, the carrying amount of asset groups was deemed recoverable. As a result, no impairment loss was recognized. No impairment indicators were present in 2010 or 2009. 24 Table of Contents SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Percentage of net revenue: Net revenue: Products 83.9 % 72.7 % 75.5 % Services 16.1 27.3 24.5 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of products 37.4 47.2 40.8 Cost of services 8.3 14.8 14.2 Total cost of revenue 45.7 62.0 55.0 Gross profit 54.3 38.0 45.0 Operating expenses: Engineering and development 12.2 20.1 19.6 Selling and administrative 14.3 24.5 22.4 Acquired intangible assets amortization 1.8 3.9 1.9 In process research and development 0.1 Restructuring and other, net 0.2 4.5 5.6 Goodwill impairment 29.8 Total operating expenses 28.6 53.0 79.4 Income (loss) from operations 25.7 (14.9 ) (34.4 ) Interest and other, net (1.2 ) (2.4 ) (0.2 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 24.5 (17.4 ) (34.6 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 0.9 (1.1 ) 1.1 Income (loss) from continuing operations 23.6 % (16.3 )% (35.7 )% Results of Operations Book to Bill Ratio Book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales.

Semiconductor Test revenue decreased $347.9 million or approximately 39% from 2008 to 2009, due to excess test capacity at our customers as a result of the global economic downturn. The Eagle Test acquisition which was completed in November of 2008 added $61.0 million of revenue in 2009 compared to $2.5 million in 2008. The decrease in Systems Test Group revenue of $71.6 million or approximately 27% from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in sales of Hard Disk Drive test systems and Mil/Aero systems and instruments, partially offset by an increase in Commercial Board Test sales, while Diagnostic Solutions product and service sales remained flat. The increase in Systems Test Group revenue of $60.3 million or approximately 29% from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to sales of Hard Disk Drive test systems, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Board Test and Diagnostic Solutions sales, while Mil/Aero product and service sales remained flat. Our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2010 2009 2008 Semiconductor Test 88 % 67 % 81 % Systems Test Group 12 33 19 100 % 100 % 100 % Net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Taiwan 18 % 14 % 18 % United States 15 26 22 Malaysia 13 11 6 Philippines 11 5 5 Singapore 9 8 10 China 8 5 5 Europe 8 10 10 Korea 8 5 7 Japan 5 6 11 Thailand 4 9 3 Rest of the World 1 1 3 100 % 100 % 100 % The breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2009 2010DollarChange 2008 2009DollarChange (in millions) Product Revenue $ 1,349.3 $ 595.3 $ 836.0 $ 754.0 $ (240.7 ) Service Revenue 259.4 224.1 271.0 35.3 (46.9 ) $ 1,608.7 $ 819.4 $ 1,107.0 $ 789.3 $ (287.6 ) Our product revenue increased $754.0 million or 127% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher sales across all Semiconductor Test products. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of Hard Disk 26 Table of Contents Drive test systems and Mil/Aero systems and instruments. Service revenue, which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales, and applications support, increased $35.3 million or 16%. Our product revenue decreased $240.7 million or 29% in 2009 from 2008 due to lower sales across all Semiconductor Test, Commercial Board Test and Diagnostic Solutions products as a result of excess test capacity at our customers due to the global economic downturn. The decrease was partially offset by sales of Hard Disk Drive test systems. The Eagle Test acquisition which was completed in November of 2008 added $52.6 million of product revenue in 2009. Service revenue decreased $46.9 million or 17% due to the global economic downturn. In 2010 and 2008, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2009, revenues from one customer accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 21%, 26%, and 14% of consolidated net revenue, respectively.

This increase in gross profit was the result of an increase of 8.9 points due to higher product sales volume, an increase of 6.6 points related to product mix and an increase of 1.8 points due to lower inventory provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 1.2 points primarily due to higher variable compensation. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 2008 to 2009 by 7.0 percentage points. This decrease in gross profit was the result of a decrease of 5.2 points due to lower product sales volume, a decrease of 4.1 points related to higher product revenue as a percentage of total revenue, which included the growth of Hard Disk Drive test system revenues, and a decrease of 1.5 points for a charge to adjust Eagle Test acquired inventory to fair value. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 3.8 points primarily from lower operations spending due to workforce reductions and lower freight and warranty charges, which were the result of lower product sales. The breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2009 2010Dollar /PointChange 2008 2009Dollar /PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Profit $ 746.9 $ 208.5 $ 384.8 $ 538.4 $ (176.3 ) Percent of Product Revenue 55.4 % 35.0 % 46.0 % 20.4 (11.0 ) Service Gross Profit $ 125.8 $ 103.1 $ 113.4 $ 22.7 $ (10.3 ) Percent of Service Revenue 48.5 % 46.0 % 41.8 % 2.5 4.2 We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. 27 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an inventory provision of $6.2 million included in cost of revenues, due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. Of the $6.2 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2010, $4.5 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $1.7 million was related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an inventory provision of $28.0 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors: Downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels as a result of worsening economic conditions experienced in the semiconductor and automotive industries primarily in the first half of 2009 resulted in an inventory provision of $16.7 million for inventory not expected to be consumed; A decline in demand versus forecast for our Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) test product due to the global economic downturn, lower product pricing by competitors, the introduction of a new product by a competitor and consolidation among a number of the expected buyers of the product, resulted in an inventory provision of $8.6 million; and During late 2008, we introduced the next versions of our Nextest Magnum memory test product. At that time, it was anticipated that demand would continue for the existing version of the product within its installed base of customers. An overall decline in the memory market combined with a portion of our customers accelerating their purchasing of the newer version of the product resulted in an inventory provision of $2.7 million. Of the $28.0 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2009, $20.3 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $7.7 million was related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an inventory provision of $29.4 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors: In the third quarter of 2008, we recorded an inventory provision of $20.2 million related to wireless instrumentation associated with our Semiconductor Test segments FLEX Test Platform. In the first half of 2008, there had been a significant increase in demand for our wireless instrumentation. In the third quarter of 2008, this wireless instrumentation demand decreased abruptly causing a reduction in forecasted demand. This significant decrease in demand combined with an upcoming wireless instrumentation product transition resulted in an inventory write down of $20.2 million; and The remainder of the charge of $9.2 million primarily reflects downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels as a result of worsening economic conditions experienced in the semiconductor test industry at the end of 2008. Of the $29.4 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2008, $24.9 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $4.5 million was related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we scrapped $5.3 million, $31.6 million and $9.8 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $8.6 million, $4.3 million and $2.4 million of previously written down or written off inventory, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written down or written off totaling $126.1 million. We have no pre determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory. Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2009 2010Change 2008 2009Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 197.0 $ 164.8 $ 216.5 $ 32.2 $ (51.7 ) Percent of Total Revenue 12.2 % 20.1 % 19.6 % 28 Table of Contents The increase of $32.2 million in engineering and development expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an $18.6 million increase in variable compensation and $6.2 million increase from the restoration of temporary salary reductions. The decrease of $51.7 million in engineering and development expenses from 2008 to 2009 was mainly due to a $54.9 million decrease in spending as a result of workforce reductions and lower project spending and a $6.2 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions. This decrease was partially offset by additional costs of $9.4 million related to the acquisition of Eagle Test in November 2008. Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2009 2010Change 2008 2009Change (dollars in millions) Selling and Administrative $ 230.1 $ 200.4 $ 247.8 $ 29.7 $ (47.4 ) Percent of Total Revenue 14.3 % 24.5 % 22.4 % The increase of $29.7 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to a $25.1 million increase in variable compensation and $9.9 million from the restoration of temporary salary reductions, partially offset by a $5.3 million decrease in other spending related to workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives taken in 2009. The decrease in selling and administrative spending of $47.4 million from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to a $57.3 million decrease from workforce reductions and on going cost reduction initiatives and a $9.9 million decrease due to temporary salary reductions, partially offset by additional costs of $19.8 million related to the acquisition of Eagle Test in November 2008. Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization Acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2009 2010Change 2008 2009Change (dollars in millions) Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization $ 29.3 $ 32.3 $ 20.6 $ (3.0 ) $ 11.7 Percent of Total Revenue 1.8 % 3.9 % 1.9 % Acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2009 to 2010 because intangible assets related to the 2001 GenRad acquisition were fully amortized in 2009. Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2008 to 2009 due to the Eagle Test acquisition which was completed in November of 2008. Goodwill Impairment We experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of 2008. This sharp decline led to a $329.7 million non cash impairment of all our goodwill balance. In process Research and Development In 2008, we recorded an expense of $1.6 million related to in process research and development related to the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test. 29 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Restructuring In response to a downturn in the industry in 2008 and 2009, we implemented restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs, principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations. The remaining accrual for severance and benefits of $1.8 million is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by the end of first quarter of 2011. The remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities of $3.9 million is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the long term other accrued liabilities account, and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2013. We expect to pay approximately $1.9 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Our future lease commitments, as of December 31, 2010, are net of expected sublease income of $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, we have subleased approximately 53% of our unoccupied space. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.3 million related to ongoing efforts to lower expenses and our cost structure, $(2.7) million credit related to the early exit of previously impaired facilities and $0.3 million related to a change in estimated severance benefits for the Q2 2009 action. The restructuring charges consisted of the following activities: Q1 2010 Actions: $0.8 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 14 people, of which $0.4 million and 10 people were in Systems Test Group and $0.4 million and 4 people were in Semiconductor Test. Q2 2010 Actions: $1.3 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 10 people in Systems Test Group; and $0.8 million of facility charges in Systems Test Group related to the early exit of leased facilities in Kontich, Belgium and Stockport, United Kingdom. Q3 2010 Actions: $1.4 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 22 people in Systems Test Group. Q4 2010 Actions: $1.0 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 9 people in Systems Test Group. Q2 2009 Actions: $0.3 million related to a change in the estimated severance benefits related to headcount reduction activities across both segments. Pre 2008 Actions: $(2.7) million credit related to the early exit of previously impaired leased facilities in Westford, Massachusetts. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $37.9 million related to 2009 activities, as part of ongoing efforts to lower expenses and our cost structure in light of the industry wide decline in orders for semiconductor equipment, and a credit of $(0.4) million due to a change in sublease income estimate related to Q2 2008 activity. The restructuring charges (credit) recorded in 2009 consisted of the following activities: 30 Table of Contents Q1 2009 Activity: $17.6 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 518 people, of which $14.9 million and 460 people were in Semiconductor Test, $1.9 million and 42 people were in Systems Test Group, and $0.8 million and 16 people were in Corporate. Q2 2009 Activity: $15.9 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 316 people, of which $11.4 million and 267 people were in Semiconductor Test, $3.0 million and 25 people were in Corporate, and $1.5 million and 24 people were in Systems Test Group. Q3 2009 Activity: $4.1 million of charges in Corporate related to the early exit of a leased facility in North Reading; and $0.3 million of charges in Systems Test Group related to the early exit of a leased facility in Novi, Michigan. Q2 2008 Activity: $(0.4) million credit in Semiconductor Test for a revision in estimated sublease income at an exited leased facility in Ontario, Canada. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $25.8 million related to 2008 activities, mainly due to the continuation of the cost down and improved productivity efforts, the consolidation of field operations, and lowering our service infrastructure. We also recorded an additional charge of $2.7 million due to a change in sublease income estimate related to Pre 2008 activity. The restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consisted of the following activities: Q1 2008 Activity: $7.4 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 148 people, of which $6.3 million and 126 people were in Semiconductor Test, and $1.1 million and 22 people were in Systems Test Group; and $0.7 million of facility charges in Semiconductor Test related to the early exit of a leased facility in Bracknell, United Kingdom. Q2 2008 Activity: $8.1 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 132 people, of which $7.3 million and 112 people were in Semiconductor Test, and $0.8 million and 20 people were in Corporate; and $0.7 million of facility charges in Semiconductor Test related to the early exit of a leased facility in Ontario, Canada. Q4 2008 Activity: $8.9 million of severance charges across all functions and segments related to headcount reductions of approximately 190 people, of which $7.4 million and 149 people were in Semiconductor Test, $0.8 million and 21 people were in Systems Test Group, and $0.7 million and 20 people were in Corporate. Pre 2008 Activity: $2.7 million charge in Systems Test Group for a revision in estimated sublease income at a facility in Westford, Massachusetts. Other During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $(1.0) million of other net credits related to the following: $1.1 million of long lived asset impairment charges across both segments primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets as a result of the consolidation of our facilities in North Reading, Massachusetts; 31 Table of Contents $(2.0) million of credits related to finalization of certain Eagle Test purchase accounting items; and $(0.1) million related to other miscellaneous. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $34.3 million of other charges related to the following: $20.9 million loss on sale of land and buildings, including $22.6 million loss on the sale of real estate across both segments for a manufacturing facility in North Reading, Massachusetts as a result of the transfer of manufacturing to an outsourced partner and $1.7 million gain on the sale of real estate in the Semiconductor Test segment for a facility in Agoura Hills, California; $12.0 million of facility charges across both segments related to the accelerated depreciation of a manufacturing facility in North Reading, Massachusetts as a result of the transfer of manufacturing to an outsourced partner; $0.8 related to acquisition financing costs; and $0.6 million charge in the Semiconductor Test segment for a long lived asset impairment related to acquired intangible assets.

Interest income decreased by $9.2 million, from $12.6 million in 2008 to $3.4 million in 2009, due primarily to lower cash balances as a result of the acquisitions of Nextest and Eagle Test and lower interest rates. Interest expense and other increased by $3.5 million, from $23.6 million in 2009 to $27.1 million in 2010, due primarily to a $6.0 million increase in interest expense related to our convertible senior notes, a loss of $2.7 million on the exercise of the auction rate security related UBS Put, and a $2.6 million increase primarily in marketable securities amortization due to the higher marketable securities balance. In 2009, interest expense and other included $2.5 million for the write off of the remaining revolving credit facility issue costs due to the termination of our revolving credit facility agreement, $2.1 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility, and $2.8 million realized loss on sale and impairment of marketable securities. Interest expense and other increased by $9.4 million, from $14.2 million in 2008 to $23.6 million in 2009, due primarily to the following: $13.9 million of interest expense related to our convertible senior notes, $2.5 million related to the write off of the remaining revolving credit facility debt issue costs due to the termination of our revolving credit facility agreement, an increase of $1.2 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility, partially offset by a decrease of $12.6 million in losses on marketable securities. In 2008, interest expense and other included $2.8 million for the gain on sale of an equity investment and a $1.3 million life insurance gain.

The decrease in loss from continuing operations before income taxes from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2008, lower spending and lower restructuring and other costs in 2009 compared to 2008, partially offset by lower revenue in 2009 compared to 2008. Income Taxes The income tax expense from continuing operations for 2010, of $14.8 million, was related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes. The income tax benefit from continuing operations of $8.8 million for 2009 was primarily due to federal net operating loss carryback claims. The income tax expense from continuing operations for 2008, of $12.6 million, was related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes.

We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement will occur with tax authorities as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased $536.7 million in 2010 from 2009 to $1,055.5 million. Cash activity for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 2009 2010Change 2008 2009Change Cash provided by operating activities: Income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for non cash items $ 515.2 $ 42.8 $ 124.5 $ 472.4 $ (81.7 ) Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired 51.6 78.5 38.6 (26.9 ) 39.9 Cash provided by discontinued operations 0.8 (0.8 ) Total cash provided by operating activities $ 566.8 $ 121.3 $ 163.9 $ 445.5 $ (42.6 ) Total cash used for investing activities $ (627.7 ) $ (93.9 ) $ (449.1 ) $ (533.8 ) $ 355.2 Total cash provided by financing activities $ 42.4 $ 66.1 $ 46.3 $ (23.7 ) $ 19.8 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (0.5 ) 0.5 (0.8 ) (1.0 ) 1.3 Total $ (19.0 ) $ 94.0 $ (239.7 ) $ (113.0 ) $ 333.7 In 2010, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses acquired, provided cash of $51.6 million. This was due to a $38.2 million increase in operating assets and an $89.8 million increase in operating liabilities. The increase in operating assets was due to an increase in accounts receivable of $51.2 million due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in inventories, and a decrease in other current assets of $8.4 million. The increase in operating liabilities was due to a $57.7 million increase in customer advance payments due primarily to an advanced payment received from one of our Semiconductor Test customers, a $44.5 million increase in accrued employee compensation due to higher variable compensation, a $15.2 million increase in accounts payable, a $13.7 million increase in deferred revenue, an $8.5 million increase in accrued income taxes, and a $2.7 million increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by $52.5 million of retirement plan contributions. Investing activities during 2010 used cash of $627.7 million, due to $870.8 million used for purchases of marketable securities and $76.0 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of $318.1 million, and proceeds from life insurance that provided cash of $1.1 million. Financing activities during 2010 provided cash of $42.4 million due to $44.7 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans which was partially offset by $2.3 million of cash used for payments on long term debt related to the Japan loan. In 2009, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired, provided cash of $78.5 million. This was due to a decrease in operating assets of $47.1 million and an increase in operating liabilities of $31.4 million. The decrease in operating assets consisted mainly of a decrease in inventory of $63.4 million partially offset by an increase of $15.6 million in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume. The increase in operating liabilities consisted of an increase in advanced customer payments, accounts payable, deferred revenue and other accrued expenses of $46.7 million partially offset by retirement plan contributions of $15.3 million. The $46.4 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances in 2009 is due to an advanced payment of approximately $68.2 million received from one of our Semiconductor Test customers. The customer received an incremental discount and also wanted to secure its position in our manufacturing slot plan. This increase in customer advances was partially offset by a $21.8 million decrease in deferred revenue. 34 Table of Contents Investing activities in 2009 used cash of $93.9 million due to investments in property, plant and equipment of $41.9 million, payment of transaction fees related to the Eagle Test acquisition of $3.7 million, and purchases of marketable securities of $90.4 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of $41.0 million, and proceeds from life insurance policies that provided cash of $1.1 million. During 2009, financing activities provided cash of $66.1 million due to approximately $163.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes, $10.0 million of long term debt proceeds from a loan in Japan, and $15.7 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans. These increases were partially offset by $122.5 million of cash used for the repayment of our revolving credit facility and $1.1 million of cash used for principal payment on long term debt. On April 6, 2009, we completed a registered public offering of $190.0 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes (Notes) and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately $163.0 million as a result of these financing transactions. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, payable semi annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The first interest payment was on September 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted. The Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, at an initial conversion rate of approximately 182.65 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.48. The convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately $7.67 per share of our common stock, representing a 75% conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on March 31, 2009. We may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity. Holders of the Notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the Company. In 2008, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses and product lines sold and acquired, provided cash of $38.6 million. This was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.2 million as a result of a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2008, and a decrease in days sales outstanding from 66 days in 2007 to 51 days in 2008, as a result of improved collections. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accruals of $31.6 million and an increase in other assets of $32.7 million. In 2008, investing activities used cash of $449.1 million. We completed the acquisition of Nextest and Eagle Test, for a total cash purchase price and related fees, net of cash acquired of $574.3 million. Capital expenditures were $87.2 million in 2008. Proceeds from asset disposals were $61.7 million and primarily consisted of sales of real estate. In 2008, financing activities provided cash of $46.3 million. In November of 2008, we obtained a revolving credit facility that provided net cash of $119.7 million. The credit facility had a three year term that was to end on November 14, 2011. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance under the credit facility was $122.5 million. The credit facility contained customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including the financial measures of a leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, and available domestic cash to total revolving borrowings ratio. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility. On April 7, 2009, we repaid and terminated our revolving credit facility agreement. We used approximately $123.3 million of the net proceeds of the convertible senior notes transaction to repay $122.5 million of principal and $0.8 million of accrued interest outstanding under the revolving credit facility agreement. In 2008, issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans provided cash of $17.8 million. In November 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, allowing us to spend an aggregate of $400.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. During 2008, we repurchased 7.5 million 35 Table of Contents shares of common stock for $91.2 million at an average price of $12.20 per share. As of November 4, 2008, the Board of Directors suspended the stock repurchase program. In November 2010, our Board cancelled the November 2007 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $200 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1,055.5 million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans We adopted the funded status recognition provision of ASC 715 20, Compensation Retirement Benefits Defined Benefit Plans effective December 31, 2006. ASC 715 20 requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by ASC 715 20. The pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31. Our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan (U.S. Plan), certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries, and a U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest portion of our 2010 pension expense was $2.8 million for our Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations. Discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. In developing the expected return on U.S. Plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Based on this review, we believe that 7.5% was an appropriate rate to use for 2010. We will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust the rate as necessary. The December 31, 2010 asset allocation for our U.S. Plan is 57% invested in fixed income securities, 37% invested in equity securities, and 6% invested in other securities. The February 18, 2011 asset allocation for our U.S. Plan is 69% invested in fixed income securities, 30% invested in equity securities and 1% invested in other securities. Our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations. We base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2010, under the U.S. Plan, we had cumulative losses of approximately $20.1 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Index adjusted for the U.S. Plans expected cash flows and was 5.3% at December 31, 2010, down from 5.85% at December 31, 2009. We estimate that in 2011 we will recognize approximately $6.9 million of pension expense for the U.S. Plan. The U.S. Plan related pension expense estimate for 2011 is based on a 5.3% discount rate, and 5.5% return on U.S. Plan assets. Future pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans. As of December 31, 2010, we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of $129.5 million, of which $120.1 million is for the U.S. Plan. 36 Table of Contents We performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the potential change in our U.S. Plan expense for the year ending December 31, 2011, that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 4.8% 5.3% 5.8% (in millions) 5.0% $ 9.8 $ 8.4 $ 7.0 5.5% 8.3 6.9 5.5 6.0% 6.9 5.5 4.1 The assets of the U.S. Plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities. The value of our U.S. Plan assets has increased from $217.1 million at December 31, 2009 to $275.7 million at December 31, 2010. Our funding policy is to make contributions to the Pension Plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2010, we made a discretionary contribution of $45.0 million to the U.S. Plan, $1.7 million contribution to the U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Pension Plan and $3.8 million contribution to certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries. We expect to contribute approximately $1.7 million to the U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Pension Plan in 2011. Contributions that will be made in 2011 to certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately $2.2 million. We do not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. Plan in 2011. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note M: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006. The 2006 Equity Plan replaced our 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan, our 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and our 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 Equity Plan. We may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans, but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise, vesting or expiration, as applicable. At our annual meeting of stockholders held May 28, 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 22.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 25.4 million shares issuable thereunder.

(4) In connection with the acquisition of GenRad, Inc. in October 2001 (the Acquisition), we assumed the outstanding options granted under the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, the GenRad, Inc. 1991 Directors Stock Option Plan and the GenRad, Inc. 1997 Non Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the GenRad Plans). Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, these options became exercisable for shares of our common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.1733 shares of our common stock for each share of GenRads common stock. No additional options will be granted pursuant to the GenRad Plans. As of December 31, 2010, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 3,034 shares of our common stock pursuant to the GenRad Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $48.80 per share. (5) In connection with the acquisition of Nextest (the Nextest Acquisition), we assumed the options and restricted stock units granted under the Nextest Systems Corporation 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the Nextest Systems Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the Nextest Plans). Upon the consummation of the Nextest Acquisition, these options and restricted stock units were converted automatically into, respectively, options to purchase and restricted stock units representing, an aggregate of 4,417,594 shares of our common stock. No additional awards will be granted under the Nextest Plans.

(6) In connection with the acquisition of Eagle Test (the Eagle Acquisition), we assumed the options granted under the Eagle Test Systems, Inc. 2003 Stock Option and Grant Plan and the Eagle Test Systems, Inc. 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (collectively, the Eagle Plans). Upon the consummation of the Eagle Acquisition, these options were converted automatically into options to purchase an aggregate of 3,594,916 shares of our common stock. No additional awards will be granted under the Eagle Plans. As of December 31, 2010, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 651,652 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Eagle Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $3.61 per share. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to motivate employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan as of December 31, 2010 was 15,183,151 shares of our common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock based awards in the form of (1) non qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock based awards. Awards may be tied to time based vesting schedules and or performance based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the 2006 Equity Plan. Awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of Teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. The maximum number of shares of stock based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan will expire on May 24, 2016. In 2010 and 2009, we granted restricted stock units to employees and directors and restricted stock units and stock options to executive officers. In 2008, we granted restricted stock unit awards to our employees, executive officers and directors. As of December 31, 2010, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested awards and options totaled $38.2 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. Performance Graph The following graph compares the change in our cumulative total shareholder return in our common stock with each of (i) the Standard & Poors 500 Index, (ii) the S&P 500 Information Technology Index, and (iii) the 38 Table of Contents Morningstar Semiconductor Equipment & Materials Industry Group. The comparison assumes $100.00 was invested on December 31, 2005 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends, if any. This is the last year that we will compare ourselves to the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. Going forward, we will compare ourselves instead against the Morningstar Semiconductor Equipment & Materials Industry Group as this better aligns us with companies in the semiconductor equipment industry.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2010, FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010 17, Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition, to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition. The guidance in this consensus allows the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition methodology when an arrangement includes substantive milestones. The guidance provides a definition of substantive milestone and should be applied regardless of whether the arrangement includes single or multiple deliverables or units of accounting. The scope of this consensus is limited to the transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables. The guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement, individual milestones and related contingent consideration, information about substantive milestones and factors considered in the determination. The consensus is effective prospectively to milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, after June 15, 2010. We adopted this final consensus prospectively in January 2011 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in U.S. Treasuries and government agencies. Our fixed income available for sale marketable securities have a minimum rating of AA by one or more of the major credit rating agencies. We place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management We regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and the Taiwan Dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month. These contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. We do not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. Our interest rate exposure is primarily in the United States in short term and long term marketable securities. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. The potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. 40 Table of Contents
