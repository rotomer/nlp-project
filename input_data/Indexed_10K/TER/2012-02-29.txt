We design, develop, manufacture, and sell automatic test systems and solutions used to test complex electronics in the consumer electronics, automotive, computing, telecommunications, wireless, and aerospace and defense industries. Our automatic test equipment products and services include: semiconductor test (Semiconductor Test) systems; and military/aerospace (Mil/Aero) test instrumentation and systems, storage test systems (Storage Test), circuit board test and inspection (Commercial Board Test) systems, collectively these products represent Systems Test Group; and wireless test (Wireless Test) systems. We have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (OSATs), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive companies, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors as well as the United States Department of Defense. In 2011, we acquired LitePoint Corporation (LitePoint) to expand our product portfolio of test equipment in the wireless test sector. LitePoint designs, develops, and supports advanced wireless test solutions for the development and manufacturing of wireless devices, including smart phones, tablets, notebooks/laptops, personal computer peripherals, and other Wi Fi enabled devices. LitePoint is our Wireless Test segment. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. These cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry. Historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. This was particularly relevant beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 where we saw a significant decrease in revenue in our Semiconductor Test business which was impacted by the deteriorating global economy, which negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry. The sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector. We believe our acquisitions of Nextest, Eagle Test and LitePoint, and our entry into the high speed memory and storage test markets have enhanced our opportunities for growth. We will continue to invest in our business to expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs. We regularly face price competition in each of our businesses. More recently, we have been subject to greater price competition in the Semiconductor Test segment. We intend to respond to competitive pricing moves as necessary, which may adversely impact our gross margins. Longer term, we will continue to invest in engineering to lower the cost of test which should help mitigate the impacts from aggressive pricing actions. On March 21, 2011, we completed the sale of our Diagnostic Solutions business unit, which was included in the Systems Test Group segment, to SPX Corporation for $40.2 million in cash. We sold this business as its growth potential as a stand alone business was significantly less than if it was part of a larger automotive supplier. The financial information for Diagnostic Solutions has been reclassified to discontinued operations. 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, bad debts, income taxes, deferred tax assets, pensions, warranties, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Revenue Recognition In October 2009, FASB amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing non software and software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance. In October 2009, the FASB also amended the accounting standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of 2010 on a prospective basis. Adoption had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations in 2010 and 2011. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. In circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. Our equipment has non software and software components that function together to deliver the equipments essential functionality. Revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. Certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. Where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. We also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), (ii) third party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (BESP). For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control. Our post shipment obligations include installation, training services, one year standard warranties, and extended warranties. Installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. Installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. Training services are optional and do not 21 Table of Contents affect the customers ability to use the product. We defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training. Extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 20, Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts. Our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized. We classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. We generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products. For transactions involving the sale of software, revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 985 605, Software Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements, revenue related to the undelivered elements is deferred to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for such elements. In instances where VSOE does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement, all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered. VSOE is the price charged when the element is sold separately. Revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element. For certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under ASC 605 35, Revenue Recognition Construction Type and Production Type Contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs. These arrangements require significant production, modification, or customization. In all cases, changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. With respect to contract change orders, claims or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. Such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured, generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order. Inventories Inventories, which include materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. We record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix, and possible alternative uses. Equity Incentive and Stock Purchase Plans Stock based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 10 Compensation Stock Compensation. As required by ASC 718 10, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest. Income Taxes On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance. We consider the probability of future taxable income and our historical profitability, among other factors, in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. As a result of this review, undertaken at December 31, 2002, we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions, most notably the United States. At December 31, 2011, we reassessed this judgment and concluded 22 Table of Contents that it is more likely than not that a substantial majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized through consideration of both the positive and negative evidence. The evidence consisted primarily of our three year U.S. historical cumulative profitability, projected future taxable income, forecasted utilization of the deferred tax assets and the fourth quarter of 2011 acquisition of LitePoint offset by the volatility of the industries we operate in, primarily the semiconductor industry. As such, we reduced the valuation allowance by $190.2 million, which was recorded as a tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2011. We maintain a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of $51.1 million, primarily related to excess stock compensation deductions associated with pre 2006 activity, state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards, due to uncertainty regarding their realization. Adjustments could be required in the future if we estimate that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount we have recorded. Investments We account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320 10, Investments Debt and Equity Securities. On a quarterly basis, we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include: The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; and The intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Goodwill, Intangible and Long Lived Assets In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This new guidance is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the current two step goodwill impairment test. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011 and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets, and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. 23 Table of Contents SELECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Percentage of net revenues: Net revenues: Products 81.2 % 85.0 % 74.2 % Services 18.8 15.0 25.8 Total net revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of products 40.4 37.8 47.7 Cost of services 9.7 7.6 13.8 Total cost of revenues 50.1 45.3 61.5 Gross profit 49.9 54.7 38.5 Operating expenses: Engineering and development 13.7 12.3 20.8 Selling and administrative 16.4 14.5 25.1 Acquired intangible assets amortization 2.8 1.9 4.2 Restructuring and other 0.6 (0.1 ) 4.5 Total operating expenses 33.4 28.6 54.6 Income (loss) from operations 16.5 26.0 (16.1 ) Interest and other, net (1.2 ) (1.2 ) (2.4 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 15.3 24.8 (18.5 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes (9.0 ) 0.9 (1.1 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 24.3 23.9 (17.4 ) Income from discontinued operations before income taxes 0.1 0.3 0.2 (Benefit) provision for income taxes 0.0 0.0 0.0 Income from discontinued operations 0.1 0.3 0.2 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations (net of taxes) 1.7 0.0 0.0 Net income (loss) 26.2 % 24.2 % (17.2 )% Results of Operations Book to Bill Ratio Book to bill ratio is calculated as net bookings divided by net sales.

Semiconductor Test product demand can fluctuate significantly from year to year based upon semiconductor device unit growth and installed base utilization. The 2011 decrease was due to lower volume from reduced demand. Semiconductor Test revenue increased $860.9 million or approximately 156% from 2009 to 2010, due to a strong recovery in the semiconductor market, particularly in SOC test, and due to our strong market share in the higher growth Semiconductor Test segments such as power management, wireless and microcontroller. The increase in Systems Test Group revenue of $141.6 million or approximately 93% from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in sales of Storage Test systems, which was driven by new customers and new product applications. The decrease in Systems Test Group revenue of $72.1 million or approximately 32% from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in sales of Storage Test systems and Mil/Aero systems and instruments, partially offset by an increase in Commercial Board Test sales. The acquisition of LitePoint which was completed in October of 2011 added $28.4 million of revenue in 2011. Litepoint is our Wireless Test segment. Our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years: 2011 2010 2009 Semiconductor Test 77 % 90 % 71 % Systems Test Group 21 10 29 Wireless Test 2 100 % 100 % 100 % Net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 United States 16 % 15 % 25 % China 13 9 5 Taiwan 12 18 14 Malaysia 10 13 12 Korea 10 8 5 Japan 10 5 6 Philippines 9 12 6 Europe 7 6 7 Singapore 6 9 9 Thailand 6 4 9 Rest of the World 1 1 2 100 % 100 % 100 % 25 Table of Contents The breakout of product and service revenue for the past three years was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2010 2011DollarChange 2009 2010DollarChange (in millions) Product Revenue $ 1,160.2 $ 1,331.0 $ 576.5 $ (170.8 ) $ 754.5 Service Revenue 268.9 235.2 200.9 33.7 34.3 $ 1,429.1 $ 1,566.2 $ 777.4 $ (137.1 ) $ 788.8 Our product revenue decreased $170.8 million or 13% in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to lower sales of SOC Semiconductor Test products. Semiconductor Test product sales demand can fluctuate significantly from year to year based upon semiconductor device unit growth and installed base utilization. The 2011 decrease was due to lower volume from reduced demand. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of Storage Test systems, which was driven by new customers and new product applications. The LitePoint acquisition which was completed in October of 2011 added $27.8 million of product revenue in 2011. Service revenue, which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales, and applications support, increased $33.7 million or 14% due to higher volume. Our product revenue increased $754.5 million or 131% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher sales across all Semiconductor Test products. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of Storage Test systems and Mil/Aero systems and instruments. Service revenue increased $34.3 million or 17%, due to higher volume. In fiscal year 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2009, revenues from one customer accounted for 13% of our consolidated net revenue. In each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 19%, 21% and 27% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.

This decrease was the result of a decrease of 2.9 points related to product mix primarily from higher Storage Test system sales, a decrease of 0.9 points for a charge to adjust LitePoint acquired inventory to fair value, a decrease of 0.5 points due to lower volume, and a decrease of 0.3 points due to higher inventory provisions. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 2009 to 2010 by 16.2 percentage points. This increase in gross profit was the result of an increase of 8.9 points due to higher product sales volume, an increase of 6.6 points related to product mix and an increase of 1.8 points due to lower inventory provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 1.2 points primarily due to higher variable compensation. 26 Table of Contents The breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2010 2011Dollar /PointChange 2009 2010Dollar /PointChange (dollars in millions) Product Gross Profit $ 583.1 $ 739.5 $ 205.6 $ (156.4 ) $ 533.9 Percent of Product Revenue 50.3 % 55.6 % 35.7 % (5.3 ) 19.9 Service Gross Profit $ 130.6 $ 116.5 $ 93.8 $ 14.1 $ 22.7 Percent of Service Revenue 48.6 % 49.5 % 46.7 % (0.9 ) 2.8 We assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters, is written down to estimated net realizable value. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an inventory provision of $11.6 million included in cost of revenues, due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. Of the $11.6 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2011, $10.4 million was related to Semiconductor Test primarily due to product transition, $1.1 million was related to Systems Test Group, and $0.1 million was related to Wireless Test. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an inventory provision of $6.0 million included in cost of revenues, due to the downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. Of the $6.0 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2010, $4.5 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $1.5 million was related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an inventory provision of $24.8 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors: Downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels as a result of worsening economic conditions experienced in the semiconductor and automotive industries primarily in the first half of 2009 resulted in an inventory provision of $13.5 million for inventory not expected to be consumed; A decline in demand versus forecast for our Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) test product due to the global economic downturn, lower product pricing by competitors, the introduction of a new product by a competitor and consolidation among a number of the expected buyers of the product, resulted in an inventory provision of $8.6 million; and During late 2008, we introduced the next versions of our Nextest Magnum memory test product. At that time, it was anticipated that demand would continue for the existing version of the product within its installed base of customers. An overall decline in the memory market combined with a portion of our customers accelerating their purchasing of the newer version of the product resulted in an inventory provision of $2.7 million. Of the $24.8 million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded in 2009, $20.3 million was related to Semiconductor Test and $4.5 million was related to Systems Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we scrapped $9.2 million, $4.7 million and $29.6 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $8.1 million, $8.3 million and $4.3 million of previously written down or written off inventory, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written down or written off totaling $123.5 million. We have no pre determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory. 27 Table of Contents Engineering and Development Engineering and development expenses were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2010 2011Change 2009 2010Change (dollars in millions) Engineering and Development $ 195.6 $ 193.0 $ 161.3 $ 2.6 $ 31.7 Percent of Total Revenue 13.7 % 12.3 % 20.8 % The increase of $2.6 million in engineering and development expenses from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to additional costs of $6.0 million related to the acquisition of LitePoint in October 2011, partially offset by lower variable compensation. The increase of $31.7 million in engineering and development expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an $18.6 million increase in variable compensation and $6.2 million increase from the restoration of temporary salary reductions. Selling and Administrative Selling and administrative expenses were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2010 2011Change 2009 2010Change (dollars in millions) Selling and Administrative $ 233.7 $ 226.8 $ 195.4 $ 6.9 $ 31.4 Percent of Total Revenue 16.4 % 14.5 % 25.1 % The increase of $6.9 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to additional costs of $9.7 million related to the acquisition of LitePoint in October 2011, partially offset by lower variable compensation. The increase of $31.4 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to a $25.1 million increase in variable compensation and $9.9 million from the restoration of temporary salary reductions, partially offset by a $5.3 million decrease in other spending related to workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives taken in 2009. Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization Acquired intangible assets amortization expense was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2010 2011Change 2009 2010Change (dollars in millions) Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization $ 40.5 $ 29.3 $ 32.3 $ 11.2 $ (3.0 ) Percent of Total Revenue 2.8 % 1.9 % 4.2 % Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased from 2010 to 2011 due to the LitePoint acquisition which was completed in October of 2011. Acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2009 to 2010 because intangible assets related to the 2001 GenRad acquisition were fully amortized in 2009. 28 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Restructuring In response to a downturn in the industry in 2008 and 2009, we implemented restructuring activities across all segments to reduce costs, principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations. The remaining accrual for severance and benefits of $0.3 million is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by July 2012. The remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities of $1.9 million is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the long term other accrued liabilities account, and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms, the latest of which expires in 2013. We expect to pay approximately $0.9 million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months. Our future lease commitments, as of December 31, 2011, are net of expected sublease income of $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2011, we have subleased approximately 37% of our unoccupied space. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded the following restructuring activities: Q1 2011 Actions: $0.6 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 5 people in Semiconductor Test. Q2 2011 Actions: $0.3 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 2 people in Semiconductor Test. Q2 2010 Actions: $0.2 million related to a change in the estimated severance benefits related to headcount reductions in Semiconductor Test. Q4 2010 Actions: $0.1 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions in Semiconductor Test. Pre 2009 Actions: $(0.5) million credit related to changes in the estimated exit costs related to the Westford, MA and Poway, CA facilities in System Test Group, and the North Reading, MA facility in Semiconductor Test and System Test Group. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded the following restructuring activities: Q1 2010 Actions: $0.4 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 4 people in Semiconductor Test. Q2 2010 Actions: $0.9 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 6 people in Systems Test Group. Q3 2010 Actions: $0.4 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 10 people in Systems Test Group. Q4 2010 Actions: $0.1 million of severance charges related to the headcount reduction of 1 person in Systems Test Group. 29 Table of Contents Q2 2009 Actions: $0.3 million related to a change in the estimated severance benefits related to headcount reduction activities in Semiconductor Test and System Test Group. Pre 2009 Actions: $(2.7) million credit related to the early exit of previously impaired leased facilities in Westford, Massachusetts. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded the following restructuring activities: Q1 2009 Activity: $17.2 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 515 people, of which $14.9 million and 460 people were in Semiconductor Test, $1.5 million and 39 people were in Systems Test Group, and $0.8 million and 16 people were in Corporate. Q2 2009 Activity: $15.4 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 304 people, of which $11.4 million and 267 people were in Semiconductor Test, $3.0 million and 25 people were in Corporate, and $1.0 million and 12 people were in Systems Test Group. Q3 2009 Activity: $4.1 million of charges in Corporate related to the early exit of a leased facility in North Reading. Pre 2009 Activity: $(0.4) million credit in Semiconductor Test for a revision in estimated sublease income at an exited leased facility in Ontario, Canada. Other During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $7.3 million of other charges related to the following: $4.6 million related to LitePoint acquisition costs; and $2.7 million related to non U.S pension settlements. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $(1.0) million of other net credits related to the following: $1.1 million of long lived asset impairment charges across both segments primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets as a result of the consolidation of facilities in North Reading, Massachusetts; $(2.0) million of credits related to finalization of certain Eagle Test purchase accounting items; and $(0.1) million related to other miscellaneous.

Interest income increased by $2.5 million, from $3.4 million in 2009 to $5.9 million in 2010, due primarily to a gain on sale of auction rate securities. Interest expense and other decreased by $0.8 million, from $24.5 million in 2010 to $23.7 million in 2011, due primarily to a loss on the exercise of the auction rate securities related UBS Put recorded in 2010, partially offset by higher convertible debt discount amortization in 2011. Interest expense and other increased by $2.1 million, from $22.4 million in 2009 to $24.5 million in 2010, due primarily to a $6.0 million increase in interest expense related to our convertible senior notes and a loss of $2.7 million on the exercise of the auction rate security related UBS Put. In 2009, interest expense and other included $2.5 million for the write off of the remaining revolving credit facility issue costs due to the termination of our revolving credit facility agreement, $2.1 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility, and $2.8 million realized loss on sale and impairment of marketable securities.

The increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to higher revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 and lower restructuring and other costs in 2010. Income Taxes The income tax benefit from continuing operations for 2011 totaled $129.3 million, primarily attributable to the reduction of our deferred income tax valuation allowance. We considered the weight of both the positive and negative evidence as of December 31, 2011 and concluded that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The income tax expense from continuing operations of $14.5 million for 2010 was related primarily to tax provisions for foreign taxes. The income tax benefit from continuing operations of $8.5 million for 2009 was primarily due to federal net operating loss carryback claims. 31 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1 3years 3 5years More than5 years Other (in thousands) Long Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 196,430 $ 2,573 $ 193,857 $ $ $ Interest on Debt 21,533 8,631 12,902 Contingent Consideration 68,892 68,892 Operating Lease Obligations 48,949 13,822 15,973 9,675 9,479 Purchase Obligations 199,300 196,600 2,700 Retirement Plan Contributions 55,422 4,993 10,491 11,074 28,864 Other Long Term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet under GAAP (2) 73,301 34,481 38,820 Total $ 663,827 $ 295,511 $ 270,404 $ 20,749 $ 38,343 $ 38,820 (1) Long Term Debt Obligations include current maturities.

For certain long term obligations, we are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations and therefore we included these amounts in the column marked Other. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased $300.8 million in 2011 from 2010 to $754.6 million. Cash activity for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2010 2011Change 2009 2010Change (in millions) Cash provided by operating activities: Income from continuing operations, adjusted for non cash items $ 372.6 $ 508.6 $ 35.5 $ (136.0 ) $ 473.1 Change in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses sold and acquired (94.0 ) 52.7 78.9 (146.7 ) (26.2 ) Cash (used for) provided by discontinued operations (4.8 ) 5.0 7.4 (9.8 ) (2.4 ) Total cash provided by operating activities $ 273.8 $ 566.3 $ 121.8 $ (292.5 ) $ 444.5 Cash used for investing activities from continuing operations (120.5 ) (627.7 ) (93.3 ) 507.2 (534.4 ) Cash provided by (used for) investing activities from discontinued operations 39.0 (0.6 ) 39.0 0.6 Total cash used for investing activities $ (81.5 ) $ (627.7 ) $ (93.9 ) $ 546.2 $ (533.8 ) Total cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (16.3 ) $ 42.4 $ 66.1 $ (58.7 ) $ (23.7 ) Total increase (decrease) of cash and cash equivalents $ 176.0 $ (19.0 ) $ 94.0 $ 195.0 $ (113.0 ) In 2011, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses sold and acquired, used cash of $94.0 million. This was due to a $43.2 million decrease in operating assets and a $137.2 million decrease in operating liabilities. 32 Table of Contents The decrease in operating assets was due to a $66.4 million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from increased collections, partially offset by a $22.6 million increase in prepayments due primarily to supplier prepayments and a $0.6 million increase in inventories. The decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $62.6 million decrease in customer advance payments due to shipments of systems prepaid by customers, a $28.3 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to variable compensation payments, a $19.9 million decrease in accounts payable due to decreased sales volume, $11.9 million of retirement plan contributions, a $8.7 million decrease in accrued income taxes, and a $5.8 million decrease in deferred revenue. Investing activities during 2011 used cash of $120.5 million. In October 2011, we completed the acquisition of LitePoint for an initial cash purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $537.5 million. Capital expenditures were $86.1 million. Proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities were $1,194.9 million, partially offset by $691.8 million used for purchase of marketable securities. The net proceeds were used to acquire LitePoint. Financing activities during 2011 used cash of $16.3 million, due to the repurchase of 2.6 million shares of common stock for $31.2 million at an average price of $11.84 per share and $2.5 million for payments on long term debt, partially offset by $17.4 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2010, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses sold and acquired, provided cash of $52.7 million. This was due to a $38.2 million increase in operating assets and a $90.9 million increase in operating liabilities. The increase in operating assets was due to an increase in accounts receivable of $50.4 million due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in inventories, and a decrease in other current assets of $8.5 million. The increase in operating liabilities was due to a $57.7 million increase in customer advance payments due primarily to an advanced payment received from one of our Semiconductor Test customers, a $44.5 million increase in accrued employee compensation due to higher variable compensation, a $15.0 million increase in accounts payable, a $15.0 million increase in deferred revenue, an $8.5 million increase in accrued income taxes, and a $2.7 million increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by $52.5 million of retirement plan contributions. Investing activities during 2010 used cash of $627.7 million, due to $870.8 million used for purchases of marketable securities and $76.0 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of $318.1 million, and proceeds from life insurance that provided cash of $1.1 million. Financing activities during 2010 provided cash of $42.4 million due to $44.7 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans which was partially offset by $2.3 million of cash used for payments on long term debt related to the Japan loan. In 2009, changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of businesses sold and acquired, provided cash of $78.9 million. This was due to a decrease in operating assets of $42.7 million and an increase in operating liabilities of $36.2 million. The decrease in operating assets consisted mainly of a decrease in inventory of $63.2 million partially offset by an increase of $19.3 million in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume. The increase in operating liabilities consisted of an increase in advanced customer payments, accounts payable, deferred revenue and other accrued expenses of $51.5 million partially offset by retirement plan contributions of $15.3 million. The $43.3 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances in 2009 is due to an advanced payment of approximately $68.2 million received from one of our Semiconductor Test customers. The customer received an incremental discount and also wanted to secure its position in our manufacturing slot plan. This increase in customer advances was partially offset by a $24.9 million decrease in deferred revenue. Investing activities in 2009 used cash of $93.3 million due to investments in property, plant and equipment of $41.3 million, payment of transaction fees related to the Eagle Test acquisition of $3.7 million, and purchases of marketable securities of $90.4 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities that provided cash of $41.0 million, and proceeds from life insurance policies that provided cash of $1.1 million. 33 Table of Contents During 2009, financing activities provided cash of $66.1 million due to approximately $163.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes, $10.0 million of long term debt proceeds from a loan in Japan, and $15.7 million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans. These increases were partially offset by $122.5 million of cash used for the repayment of our revolving credit facility and $1.1 million of cash used for principal payment on long term debt. On April 6, 2009, we completed a registered public offering of $190.0 million aggregate principal amount convertible senior notes (Notes) and settled the related convertible bond hedge and warrant transaction and received approximately $163.0 million as a result of these financing transactions. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, payable semi annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The first interest payment was on September 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted. The Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, at an initial conversion rate of approximately 182.65 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.48. The convertible note hedge and warrant transaction will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to approximately $7.67 per share of our common stock, representing a 75% conversion premium based upon the closing price of our common stock on March 31, 2009. We may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity. Holders of the Notes may require us to purchase in cash all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the Company. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. We do not have significant cash outside the U.S. that if repatriated would incur additional taxes. In addition, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the U.S. and our operations in the U.S. provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the U.S. Inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings. Retirement Plans ASC 715 20, Compensation Retirement Benefits Defined Benefit Plans requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by ASC 715 20. The pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31. Our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan (U.S. Plan), certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries, and a U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The largest portion of our 2011 pension expense was $7.0 million for our U.S. Plan. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations. Discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. In developing the expected return on U.S. Plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment managers and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. Based on this review, we believe that 5.5% was an appropriate rate to use for 2011. We will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually, and will adjust the rate as necessary. The December 31, 2011 asset allocation for our U.S. Plan is 87% invested in fixed income securities, 12% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other 34 Table of Contents securities. Our investment managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations. We base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. As of December 31, 2011, under the U.S. Plan, we had cumulative gains of approximately $23.3 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Plan is based on the Citigroup Pension Index adjusted for the U.S. Plans expected cash flows and was 4.2% at December 31, 2011, down from 5.3% at December 31, 2010. We estimate that in 2012 we will recognize approximately $12.4 million of pension expense for the U.S. Plan. The U.S. Plan related pension expense estimate for 2012 is based on a 4.2% discount rate, and 5.0% return on U.S. Plan assets. Future pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans. As of December 31, 2011, we had unrecognized pension losses and prior service costs of $134.1 million, of which $117.7 million is for the U.S. Plan. We performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the potential U.S. Plan expense for the year ending December 31, 2012, that would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. Discount Rate Return on Plan Assets 3.7% 4.2% 4.7% (in millions) 4.5% $ 15.2 $ 13.8 $ 12.4 5.0% 13.8 12.4 11.0 5.5% 12.3 10.9 9.5 The assets of the U.S. Plan consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities. The value of our U.S. Plan assets has increased from $275.7 million at December 31, 2010 to $319.1 million at December 31, 2011. Our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2011, we made a contribution of $1.7 million to the U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Pension Plan and $8.5 million contribution to certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries. We expect to contribute approximately $1.8 million to the U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Pension Plan in 2012. Contributions that will be made in 2012 to certain qualified plans for non U.S. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately $1.7 million. We do not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. Plan in 2012. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note N: Stock Based Compensation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006. The 2006 Equity Plan replaced our 1996 Non Employee Director Stock Option Plan, our 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and our 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan, each of which were terminated upon the shareholders approval of the 2006 Equity Plan. We may not issue any additional option grants or awards under the terminated plans, but the options and awards previously granted and currently outstanding under these plans will remain in effect until the earlier of the date of their exercise, vesting or expiration, as applicable. At our annual meeting of stockholders held May 28, 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 35 Table of Contents 22.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 25.4 million shares issuable thereunder.

(4) In connection with the acquisition of Nextest (the Nextest Acquisition), we assumed the options and restricted stock units granted under the Nextest Systems Corporation 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the Nextest Systems Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the Nextest Plans). Upon the consummation of the Nextest Acquisition, these options and restricted stock units were converted automatically into, respectively, options to purchase and restricted stock units representing, an aggregate of 4,417,594 shares of our common stock. No additional awards will be granted under the Nextest Plans. As of December 31, 2011, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 1,036,584 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Nextest Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $3.05 per share. As of December 31, 2011, there were outstanding restricted stock units covering an aggregate of 29,230 shares of our common stock, none of which are included in the calculation of the weighted average exercise price. (5) In connection with the acquisition of Eagle Test (the Eagle Acquisition), we assumed the options granted under the Eagle Test Systems, Inc. 2003 Stock Option and Grant Plan and the Eagle Test Systems, Inc. 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (collectively, the Eagle Plans). Upon the consummation of the Eagle Acquisition, these options were converted automatically into options to purchase an aggregate of 3,594,916 shares of our common stock. No additional awards will be granted under the Eagle Plans. As of December 31, 2011, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 257,879 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Eagle Plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $3.65 per share. (6) In connection with the acquisition of LitePoint Corporation (the LitePoint Acquisition), we assumed the options granted under the LitePoint Corporation 2002 Stock Plan (the LitePoint Plan). Upon the consummation of the LitePoint Acquisition, these options were converted automatically into options to purchase an aggregate of 2,828,344 shares of our common stock. No additional awards will be granted under the LitePoint Plan. As of December 31, 2011, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 2,771,821 shares of our common stock pursuant to the LitePoint Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.71 per share. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to motivate employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan as of December 31, 2011 was 12,160,945 shares of our common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock based awards in the form of (1) non qualified and incentive stock 36 Table of Contents options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock based awards. Awards may be tied to time based vesting schedules and or performance based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the 2006 Equity Plan. Awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of Teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. The maximum number of shares of stock based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan will expire on May 24, 2016. As of December 31, 2011, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested awards and options totaled $60.3 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.

This ASU clarifies the concepts related to highest and best use and valuation premise, blockage factors and other premiums and discounts, the fair value measurement of financial instruments held in a portfolio and of those instruments classified as a component of shareowners equity. The guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, the use of nonfinancial assets, and the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value. The provisions of this ASU are effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. Early application is prohibited. This ASU requires changes in presentation only and we do not expect it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income. This ASU intends to enhance comparability and transparency of other comprehensive income components. The guidance provides an option to present total comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. This ASU eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income components as part of the statement of changes in shareowners equity. The provisions of this ASU will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application is permitted. This ASU requires changes in presentation only and we do not expect it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This new guidance is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the current two step goodwill impairment test. This new guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted and we adopted the standard in the fourth quarter of 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in U.S. Treasuries and government agencies. Our fixed income available for sale marketable securities have a minimum rating of AA by one or more of the major credit rating agencies. We place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable. Exchange Rate Risk Management We regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and the Taiwan Dollar. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month. These contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements, as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures. We do not engage in currency speculation. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 38 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates. Our interest rate exposure is primarily in the United States in short term and long term marketable securities. In order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a 10% fluctuation in interest rates was assumed. Market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. The potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. 39 Table of Contents
