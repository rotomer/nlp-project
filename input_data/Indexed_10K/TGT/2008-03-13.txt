Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Fiscal 2007, a 52 week period, was a year of slower sales and earnings growth for Target than in our recent past. Net earnings increased 2.2 percent to $2,849 million, and on this same basis, diluted earnings per share rose 3.9 percent to $3.33. Sales increased 6.2 percent, including comparable store sales (as defined below) growth of 3.0 percent. The shorter fiscal year in 2007 adversely impacted sales growth by 1.9 percentage points but had no impact on comparable store sales growth. The combination of retail and credit card operations produced earnings before interest expense and income taxes of $5,272 million, an increase of 4.0 percent from 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,125 million for 2007. During 2007 we repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $2,642 million. Additionally, we paid dividends of $442 million and invested $331 million in call options on our own common stock. We also opened 118 new stores in 2007, or 103 stores net of 14 relocations and one closing. Managements Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Analysis of Results of Operations Revenues and Comparable Store Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 for a definition of gift card breakage. Total revenues include sales and credit card revenues. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Comparable store sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including: sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable store sales do not include: sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable store sales increases or decreases are calculated by comparing sales in current year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. Revenue Growth 2007 2006 2005 Comparable store sales 3.0% 4.8% 5.6% Sales(a) 6.2% 12.9% 12.2% Credit card revenues(a) 17.6% 19.5% 16.5% Total revenues(a) 6.5% 13.1% 12.3% (a) 2006 consisted of 53 weeks. In 2007, a 52 week year following a 53 week year, total revenues were $63,367 million compared with $59,490 in 2006, an increase of 6.5 percent. Total revenue growth was attributable to the opening of new stores, a comparable store sales increase of 3.0 percent and a 17.6 percent increase in credit card revenues. These factors were partially offset by the impact of an extra week in 2006. Comparable store sales growth in 2007 was primarily attributable to growth in average transaction amount. Comparable store sales growth in 2006 was attributable to growth in average transaction amount and the number of transactions in comparable stores. In each of the past several years, our comparable store sales growth has experienced a modest negative impact due to the transfer of sales to new stores. In 2007, there was a deflationary impact of approximately 2 percent on sales growth compared with a deflationary impact of 1 percent in 2006. In 2008, we expect sales growth to increase in the 8 to 9 percent range, reflecting the continued contribution from new stores and an expected comparable store sales increase in the range of 2 to 3 percent. We do not expect inflation/deflation to have a significant effect on sales growth in 2008. Beginning in 2007, we changed our definition of comparable store sales to include sales from our online business because we believe this combined measure represents a more useful disclosure in light of our fully integrated, multi channel approach to our business. Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in cost of sales. In 2007, our consolidated gross margin rate was 31.8 percent compared with 31.9 percent in 2006. Within our gross margin rate for the year, we experienced a deterioration in markup due to sales mix. Markup is the difference between an items cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like the cost of raw materials and freight, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management and competitive influences. The definition and method of calculating markup, markdowns and gross margin varies across the retail industry. In 2006, our consolidated gross margin rate was 31.9 percent compared with 31.9 percent in 2005. Within our gross margin rate for 2006, we experienced an increase in markup, which was offset by an increase in markdowns. In 2008 we expect our gross margin rate to decrease modestly from 2007. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2007 our SG&A expense rate was 22.3 percent compared with 22.2 percent in 2006. Within SG&A expenses in 2007 there were no expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation in expenses as a percentage of sales, when compared with 2006. In 2006, our SG&A expense rate was 22.2 percent compared with 21.8 percent in 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher store payroll costs, the year over year impact of reduced transition services income related to our 2004 divestiture of Mervyns and the $27 million Visa/MasterCard settlement that reduced SG&A expense in 2005. In 2008, we expect our SG&A expense rate to be approximately equal to our 2007 rate. Credit Card Contribution We offer credit to qualified guests through our REDcard products, the Target Visa and the Target Card. Our credit card program strategically supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability. Our credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenues. In addition, we receive fees from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card. Effective February 2007, we redefined Credit Card Contribution to Earnings Before Taxes (EBT) to exclude intra company merchant fees and include the effect of new account and loyalty rewards discounts as expenses of our credit card programs. We have reclassified prior period amounts to conform to the current year disclosure. These changes were made to better facilitate comparison of our credit card results to the performance of other bank card portfolios and to better facilitate comparison of our core retail operations to other retailers who have sold their credit card portfolios to third parties. These reclassifications had no effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2007, our net credit card revenues increased primarily due to an 18.1 percent increase in average receivables, combined with a moderate increase in the yield on those receivables. Late fees and other revenue of $422 million benefited from a change in terms for the Target Card portfolio. Our credit card operations are allocated a portion of consolidated interest expense based on estimated funding costs for average net accounts receivable and other financial services assets. Our allocation methodology assumes that 90 percent of the sum of average net receivables and other financial services assets are debt financed with a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt in proportion to the mix of fixed and variable rate financial services assets. The majority of our credit card portfolio earns interest at variable rates; thus, the majority of the interest allocation to the credit card business is at rates that are determined based upon our approximate variable rate cost of borrowed funds. Credit card expenses include a bad debt provision, as well as operations and marketing expenses supporting our credit card portfolio. In 2007 versus 2006, our bad debt provision increased relative to our average receivables balance due to higher net write offs experienced during the year as write offs returned to a more normalized level. In 2006 versus 2005, our bad debt provision decreased relative to our average receivables balance due to the favorable write off experience and continued strength of the overall credit quality of the portfolio. Our 2006 year end reserve balance as a percentage of average receivables increased as we reserved for the expected increase in future write offs. Our delinquency rates increased in the last quarter of 2006 as compared with 2005 as we cycled the effects of the October 2005 federal bankruptcy legislation and experienced the effects of the mandated increases in minimum payments for certain guests. Operations and marketing expenses increased primarily due to the growth of the Target Visa portfolio. In 2007, our credit card operations contribution to earnings before income taxes (EBT) was $600 million, a 20.8 percent increase from 2006. The favorability in credit card contribution was attributable to strong growth in both net interest income and non interest income partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. In 2006, our credit card operations contribution to earnings before income taxes (EBT) was $497 million, a 83.5 percent increase from 2005. The favorability in credit card contribution was attributable to strong growth in net interest income and the year over year reduction in bad debt expense. Our receivables balance grew at a very strong pace in the second half of 2007, and while we expect that this sequential growth is behind us, we will continue to enjoy the benefit of this growth on a year over year basis in the first half of 2008. Our EBT yields will likely remain at industry leading levels, although not likely fully achieving the record levels set in 2007, especially in the first half of the year. We expect 60+ day delinquency rates to remain stable throughout 2008 at recent levels, in the range of 4 percent, and our annualized net write offs as a percentage of average receivables, as we report them quarterly, are not likely to rise much above 7 percent. Credit Card Contribution to EBT (millions) 2007 2006 2005 Revenues Finance charges $ 1,308 $ 1,117 $ 915 Interest expense (330 ) (286 ) (193 ) Net interest income 978 831 722 Late fees and other revenues 422 356 310 Third party merchant fees 166 139 124 New account and loyalty rewards discounts (a) (113 ) (107 ) (96 ) Non interest income 475 388 338 Net credit card revenues 1,453 1,219 1,060 Expenses Bad debt provision 481 380 466 Operations and marketing 356 327 310 Allocated depreciation charge (b) 16 15 13 Total expenses 853 722 789 Credit card contribution to EBT $ 600 $ 497 $ 271 As a percentage of average receivables 8.3% 7.9% 4.9% Net interest margin (c) 13.4% 13.2% 13.0% (a) Primarily consists of new account and loyalty rewards program discounts on our REDcard products, which are included as reductions of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. (b) Included in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. (c) Net interest income divided by average accounts receivable. Receivables (millions) 2007 2006 2005 Year end receivables $ 8,624 $ 6,711 $ 6,117 Average receivables $ 7,275 $ 6,161 $ 5,544 Accounts with three or more payments (60+ days) past due as a percentage of year end receivables 4.0% 3.5% 2.8% Accounts with four or more payments (90+ days) past due as a percentage of year end receivables 2.7% 2.4% 1.9% Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (millions) 2007 2006 2005 Allowance at beginning of year $ 517 $ 451 $ 387 Bad debt provision 481 380 466 Net write offs (428 ) (314 ) (402 ) Allowance at end of year $ 570 $ 517 $ 451 As a percentage of year end receivables 6.6% 7.7% 7.4% Net write offs as a percentage of average receivables 5.9% 5.1% 7.2% We offer new account discounts and rewards programs on our REDcard products. These discounts and rewards are redeemable only on purchases made at Target. The discounts associated with our REDcard products are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were $108 million, $104 million and $97 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization In 2007, depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1,659 million, an increase of 10.9 percent. The increase was due to increased capital expenditures, specifically related to investments in new stores. In 2006, depreciation and amortization expense increased 6.1 percent, to $1,496 million. During 2006, we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms for individual leases, resulting in a cumulative benefit to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $28 million. We expect 2008 depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.9 billion. Net Interest Expense In 2007, net interest expense was $647 million compared with $572 million in 2006, an increase of 13.2 percent. This increase related to higher average debt balances, including the debt to fund growth in accounts receivable, partially offset by the benefit of one less week. The average portfolio interest rate was 6.1 percent in 2007 and 6.2 percent in 2006. In 2006, net interest expense was $572 million compared with $463 million in 2005, an increase of 23.4 percent. This increase related primarily to growth in the cost of funding our credit card operations and was also unfavorably impacted by the 53rd week in 2006. The average portfolio interest rate was 6.2 percent in 2006 and 5.9 percent in 2005. Our 2008 net interest expense is expected to increase due to significantly higher average net debt balances. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 38.4 percent in 2007, 38.0 percent in 2006 and 37.6 percent in 2005. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to the less favorable impact that capital market returns had on certain book to tax differences during 2007, compared to the more favorable returns in 2006. Our lower 2005 effective rate was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2005. We do not expect our 2008 effective income tax rate to change significantly from 2007. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial condition remains strong. In assessing our financial condition, we consider factors such as cash flows provided by operations, capital expenditures and debt service obligations. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,125 million in 2007 compared with $4,862 million in 2006, primarily due to significantly greater growth in Target Visa accounts receivable and an investment in inventory growth, net of accounts payable. We continue to fund our growth and execute our share repurchase program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt financing. Our year end gross receivables were $8,624 million compared with $6,711 million in 2006, an increase of 28.5 percent. This growth was driven by many factors, including a product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher limit Target Visa cards for a group of higher credit quality Target Card Guests and the impact of an industry wide decline in payment rates. Average receivables in 2007 increased 18.1 percent. Given the significant rate of growth of receivables in 2007, we expect that our average receivables balance during the first half of 2008 will be significantly greater than that in 2007. Additionally, absent product changes for additional Target Card holders in 2008, we expect that our year end 2008 receivable balance will rise only modestly. Year end inventory levels increased $525 million, or 8.4 percent, reflecting the natural increase required to support additional square footage and comparable store sales growth. This growth was partially funded by an increase in accounts payable over the same period. During 2007, we repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,642 million ($57.24 per share). Of these repurchases, 26.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $1,445 million ($54.64 per share) were made under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. We intend to complete this new share repurchase program within approximately three years through open market transactions and other means. Under the right combination of business results, liquidity and share price, we would expect to complete half, or more, of this new program by the end of 2008. The remaining shares repurchased in 2007 were under the prior program. Under the prior program that was originally approved in June 2004 and amended in November 2005 and June 2007, we repurchased a total of 90.7 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $4,646 million ($51.20 per share) from June 2004 through November 2007. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we purchased and sold a series of call options at a net cost of $331 million on 30 million shares of our common stock. The options expire in the first and second quarters of 2008. Refer to Note 24 for further details of these instruments. In 2006 we repurchased 19.5 million shares for a total investment of $977 million ($50.16 per share). During 2007 and 2006 some of the shares repurchased were delivered upon the settlement of prepaid forward contracts. The details of prepaid forward contract settlements and our long positions in prepaid forward contracts have been provided in Note 24 and Note 26. In 2007 we declared dividends of $.54 per share totaling $454 million, an increase of 14.6 percent over 2006. In 2006 we declared dividends of $.46 per share totaling $396 million, an increase of 18.6 percent over 2005. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with current levels of cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from borrowings and or the potential sale of some or all of our receivables, will be sufficient in 2008 to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, growth in receivables, maturities of long term debt, seasonal inventory buildup and other cash requirements. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our cost of borrowing. Maintaining strong investment grade debt ratings is a key part of our strategy. Our debt ratings as of February 2, 2008 were as follows: Debt Ratings Standard and Poors Moodys Fitch Long term debt A2 A+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 Securitized receivables Aaa AAA n/a As described in Note 18, during 2007 we issued $6,750 million of long term debt, and we issued $1,900 million of Variable Funding Certificates backed by credit card receivables through the Target Credit Card Master Trust. As of February 2, 2008, $1,500 million of the Variable Funding Certificates were outstanding. Further liquidity is provided by a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2007 or 2006 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities. Most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. At February 2, 2008, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (a) a change in control and (b) our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade, or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade. Our interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio calculated as prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules was 6.4x, 7.1x, and 7.2x in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $4,369 million in 2007 compared with $3,928 million in 2006 and $3,388 million in 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to continued new store expansion. Approximately $1,404 million of 2007 capital expenditures is related to stores that will open in 2008 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $2,664 million in 2007 following an increase of $2,393 million in 2006. Capital Expenditures Percentage of Capital Expenditures 2007 2006 2005 New stores 71 % 61 % 60 % Remodels and expansions 7 12 12 Information technology, distribution and other 22 27 28 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % In 2008, we expect to invest $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in capital expenditures, including investments in approximately 116 new stores, adding about 95 new locations, net of relocations and closings, and two distribution centers that will open in 2008. Number of Stores February 2, February 3, 2008 Opened Closed (a) 2007 Target general merchandise stores 1,381 85 15 1,311 SuperTarget stores 210 33 177 Total 1,591 118 15 1,488 Retail Square Feet (b) (thousands) Target general merchandise stores 170,858 11,621 1,569 160,806 SuperTarget stores 37,087 5,829 31,258 Total 207,945 17,450 1,569 192,064 (a) Includes 14 store relocations in the same trade area and 1 store closed without replacement. (b) Reflects total square feet, less office, distribution center and vacant space. Commitments and Contingencies At February 2, 2008, our contractual obligations were as follows: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt (a) $ 16,726 $ 1,951 $ 3,487 $ 2,358 $ 8,930 Interest payments long term debt (b) 12,314 922 1,619 1,299 8,474 Capital lease obligations 232 12 32 33 155 Operating leases (c) 3,694 239 360 252 2,843 Deferred compensation 662 176 148 125 213 Real estate obligations 1,078 856 220 2 Purchase obligations 663 351 303 9 Contractual cash obligations $ 35,369 $ 4,507 $ 6,169 $ 4,078 $ 20,615 (a) Required principal payments only. Excludes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," fair market value adjustments recorded in long term debt. Includes $500 million of short term borrowings that are due in the first quarter of 2008. (b) Includes payments on $2,400 million of floating rate debt secured by credit card receivables, $500 million of which matures in 2008, $900 million of which matures in 2010, and $1,000 million of which matures in 12 monthly installments beginning in May 2012. These payments are calculated assuming rates of approximately 3.3 percent, based on presumed LIBOR of 3.15 percent plus a spread, for each year outstanding. Excludes payments received or made related to interest rate swaps. The fair value of outstanding interest rate swaps has been provided in Note 20. (c) Total contractual lease payments include $1,721 million of lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes $98 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2008 or later. Refer to Note 21 for a further description of leases. Note: Tax contingencies of $571 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, purchases of equipment, marketing related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.  We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for 2008, is included in Note 27. We have not provided any material financial guarantees as of February 2, 2008. We have not created and are not party to any off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially all of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last in, first out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Examples of relevant economic conditions include shifting consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because substantially all of our inventory turns in less than six months. Inventory is further described in Note 10. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is earned for a variety of vendor sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and the amount earned. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in aggregate. The majority of all year end receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Vendor income is described further in Note 4. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit fees. We estimate future write offs based on delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends, industry risk trends and our historical experience. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. Historically, our allowance for doubtful accounts has been sufficient to cover actual credit losses, and we believe that the allowance recorded at February 2, 2008 is also sufficient to cover anticipated losses. Accounts receivable is described in Note 9. Analysis of long lived and intangible assets for impairment We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually at the store level. The carrying amount of assets is compared with the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated remaining economic lives. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written down to fair value. Impairment testing of intangibles requires a comparison between the carrying value and the fair value. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value for the purposes of the required annual impairment analysis. No material impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005 as a result of the tests performed. Insurance/self insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with our insurance policies. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22. Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine pension and postretirement health care expense for the following plan year. Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" (SFAS 158), as discussed below in the 2007 Adoptions section. The discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in Note 27. The amount of benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.1 percent increase to the weighted average discount rate used to determine pension and postretirement health care expenses would decrease annual expense by approximately $1 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older, longer service pension eligible team members. In 2007, we increased the assumed rate of compensation increase by 0.25 percentage points for the purpose of calculating the February 2, 2008 benefit obligation, which increased the net periodic benefit cost for 2007 by approximately $2 million. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27. New Accounting Pronouncements 2007 Adoptions In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158. SFAS 158 requires sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively postretirement benefit plans) to recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial position and provide additional disclosures. We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 during 2006. We adopted the SFAS 158 measurement date provision at the beginning of the first quarter of 2007, and the details of our adoption of this provision are described in Note 27. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for tax positions taken in a tax return, clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded and how they should be classified in financial statements and requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2007, and the details of our adoption of FIN 48 are described in Note 22. At the beginning of the first quarter of 2007, we adopted the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06 5, "Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance" and recorded a $4 million increase to other noncurrent assets, with a corresponding increase to retained earnings of $4 million. 2008 and Future Adoptions In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008 for financial assets and liabilities and at the beginning of fiscal 2009 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008. The adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141(R)), which changes the accounting for business combinations and their effects on the financial statements. SFAS 141(R) will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51" (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires entities to report non controlling interests in subsidiaries as equity in their consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. Forward Looking Statements This report, including the preceding Managements Discussion and Analysis, contains forward looking statements regarding our performance, financial position, liquidity and adequacy of capital resources. Forward looking statements are typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The forward looking statements in this report include the anticipated impact of new and proposed accounting pronouncements, the expected outcome of pending and threatened litigation, our expectations with respect to our share repurchase program and our outlook in fiscal 2008. Forward looking statements are based on our current assumptions and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. We caution that the forward looking statements are qualified by the risks and challenges posed by increased competition (including the effects of competitor liquidation activities), shifting consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets, changing wages, health care and other benefit costs, shifting capital markets and general economic conditions, hiring and retaining effective team members, sourcing merchandise from domestic and international vendors, investing in new business strategies, changes in the political or regulatory environment, the outbreak of war or pandemics and other significant national and international events, and other risks and uncertainties. As a result, although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on those statements. You are encouraged to review Exhibit (99)A to this Form 10 K, which contains additional important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. Our degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and vary in different interest rate environments. At February 2, 2008, our level of floating rate credit card assets exceeded our level of net floating rate debt obligations by approximately $1.4 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at February 2, 2008, the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our interest rate swap agreements and other floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $14 million. See further description in Note 20 and Note 29. We record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically and in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at February 2, 2008, the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $16 million. In addition, we are exposed to fluctuations of market returns on our qualified defined benefit pension and nonqualified defined contribution plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $22 million at February 2, 2008. The resulting impact on net pension expense would be calculated consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold high quality, long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. See further description in Note 27. As more fully described in Note 13 and Note 26, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control our risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. We do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.
