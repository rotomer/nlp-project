Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year reflect the impact of adverse economic conditions on our business segments. Our Retail Segment results were affected by changes in consumer spending patterns that negatively impacted our traffic and sales, particularly in higher margin discretionary categories, creating an elevated level of markdowns resulting from weaker than expected sales. Our Credit Card Segment performance, like that of other credit card issuers, was adversely affected by the deteriorating credit and risk environment. As a result, we incurred higher than expected bad debt expense as we both wrote off accounts and added significantly to our allowance for doubtful accounts. In light of this challenging retail and credit environment, we have suspended our share repurchase program and reduced spending on new store construction and remodels. Sales totaled $62,884 million in 2008, $61,471 million in 2007 and $57,878 million in 2006, increasing 2.3 percent in 2008 and 6.2 percent in 2007. Comparable store sales (as defined below) in 2008 declined 2.9 percent from 2007; comparable store sales in 2007 grew 3.0 percent from 2006. Credit card revenues were $2,064 million, $1,896 million and $1,612 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, increasing 8.9 percent in 2008 and 17.6 percent in 2007. The combination of retail and credit card operations produced earnings before interest expense and income taxes of $4,402 million in 2008, $5,272 million in 2007 and $5,069 million in 2006, decreasing 16.5 percent in 2008 and increasing 4.0 percent in 2007. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,430 million, $4,125 million and $4,862 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, we paid dividends of $465 million in 2008, $442 million in 2007 and $380 million in 2006. We opened 114 new stores in 2008, or 91 stores net of 21 relocations and two closings. In 2007, we opened 118 new stores representing 103 stores net of 14 relocations and one closing. Managements Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Refer to Note 2 for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for the 2008 year were $62,884 million, compared with $61,471 million in 2007 and $57,878 million in 2006. The 2008 and 2007 periods were 52 week years compared to the 2006 period that was a 53 week year. Growth in total sales between 2008 and 2007 resulted from sales from stores opened in 2008, offset by lower comparable store sales. The increase in total sales between 2007 and 2006 is attributable to both new stores and comparable store sales increases. In 2008, inflation affected sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points, compared with a deflationary impact of 2 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2006.

The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, beginning in 2007, we changed our comparable store sales calculation to include sales from our online business because we believe this combined measure represents a more useful disclosure in light of our fully integrated, multi channel approach to our business. Comparable store sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including: sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable store sales do not include: sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable Store Sales 2008 2007 2006 Comparable store sales (2.9) % 3.0 % 4.8 % Drivers of changes in comparable store sales: Number of transactions (3.1) % 0.3 % 1.1 % Average transaction amount 0.2 % 2.6 % 3.7 % Units per transaction (2.1) % 1.1 % 2.2 % Selling price per unit 2.3 % 1.5 % 1.4 % The comparable store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length. In 2008, the change in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, slightly offset by an increase in average transaction amount, which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction. In fiscal 2007, the comparable store sales increase was driven primarily by an increase in average transaction amount when compared to 2006, with both the number of units and selling price per unit sold, each representing roughly half of the increase attributable to average transaction amount. Transaction level metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, and comparable store sales rates is negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores. 13 Table of Contents Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an items cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions. In 2008, our consolidated gross margin rate was 29.8 percent compared with 30.2 percent in 2007. Our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix, which resulted in a 0.6 percentage point reduction in the gross margin rate. Sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates (generally non discretionary product categories of consumables and commodities) outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories. This mix impact was partially offset by favorable supply chain expense rates, as well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment, which had a combined favorable impact on gross margin rate of approximately 0.2 percentage point. In 2007, our consolidated gross margin rate was consistent with the 2006 gross margin rate. Our gross margin rate for 2007 benefited from higher margin rates within merchandise categories. Substantially all of this benefit was offset by the adverse effects from sales of lower margin merchandise categories outpacing sales of higher margin merchandise categories. During 2007, rate improvement within categories was driven generally by an array of inventory control initiatives that minimized markdowns. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of expenses included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. SG&A expense rate was 20.4 percent in 2008, which was the same as 2007 and consistent with 20.3 percent in 2006. Within SG&A expenses in 2008 and 2007, there were no expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation as a percentage of sales, when compared to prior periods. These expense rates reflect sustained productivity gains in our stores and disciplined expense control across the Corporation. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2008, our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 2.9 percent compared with 2.7 percent in 2007 and 2.6 percent in 2006. The comparative increases in 2008 and 2007 were due to increased capital expenditures, specifically related to investments in new stores. During 2006, we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms for individual leases, resulting in a cumulative benefit to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $28 million.

For 2008, 2007 and 2006, these amounts exclude $4,503 million, $2,387 million and $1,782 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables.(c)ROIC is return on invested capital, and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average receivables funded by Target, expressed as an annualized rate.(d)As an annualized percentage of average receivables. 2008 2007 2006 Spread Analysis Total Portfolio Amount (in millions) Annualized Rate Amount (in millions) Annualized Rate Amount (in millions) Annualized Rate EBIT $ 322 3.7 % (b) $ 930 12.8 % (b) $ 783 12.5 % (b) LIBOR (a) 2.3 % 5.1 % 5.2 % Spread to LIBOR (c) $ 118 1.4 % (b) $ 558 7.7 % (b) $ 450 7.3 % (b) (a) Balance weighted one month LIBOR (b) As a percentage of average receivables (c) Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the vast majority of our portfolio earns finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. Our primary measure of profitability in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital Target has invested in our credit card receivables. In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The vast majority of our portfolio accrues finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. Segment profit and dollar spread to LIBOR measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense. Segment revenues were $2,064 million, an increase of $168 million, or 8.9 percent, from the prior year, driven by a 19.5 percent increase in average receivables. On a rate basis, 15 Table of Contents revenue yield decreased 2.4 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the Prime Rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees. This negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our effective yield. Segment expenses were $1,742 million, an increase of $776 million, or 80.3 percent, from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of $770 million. The increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net write off rate from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 9.3 percent in 2008 and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $440 million for anticipated future write offs of current receivables. Segment profit decreased from 16.3 percent in 2007 to 3.7 percent in 2008 primarily due to the effect of bad debt expense, the reduction in receivables owned and funded by Target, and the impact of a lower Prime Rate during 2008. 2007 segment revenues were $1,896 million, an increase of $284 million, or 17.6 percent, from the prior year, driven by a higher average receivables balance. The annualized rates for the components of segment revenue were consistent with prior periods. Segment expenses were $966 million, an increase of $136 million, or 16.4 percent, from 2006. This increase was due to bad debt expense in 2007 which rose reflecting an increase in net write offs and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of higher expected future losses on period end receivables. Segment ROIC benefited from a slightly higher percentage of third party funding of our credit card receivables. We implemented a terms change to our portfolio, effective in April 2009, that establishes a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to a receivables balance as a finance charge. Under this terms change, finance charges will accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than a threshold amount; if the Prime Rate is greater than the threshold, finance charges will accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread. Receivables Rollforward Analysis Fiscal Year Percent Change (millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Beginning receivables $ 8,624 $ 6,711 $ 6,117 28.5 % 9.7 % Charges at Target 4,207 4,491 4,339 (6.3 ) 3.5 Charges at third parties 8,542 9,398 7,831 (9.1 ) 20.0 Payments (13,482 ) (13,388 ) (12,832 ) 0.7 4.3 Other 1,203 1,412 1,256 (14.8 ) 12.4 Period end receivables $ 9,094 $ 8,624 $ 6,711 5.4 28.5 Average receivables $ 8,695 $ 7,275 $ 6,161 19.5 18.1 Accounts with three or more payments (60+ days) past due as a percentage of period end receivables 6.1 % 4.0 % 3.5 % Accounts with four or more payments (90+ days) past due as a percentage of period end receivables 4.3 % 2.7 % 2.4 % Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Fiscal Year Percent Change (millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Allowance at beginning of period $ 570 $ 517 $ 451 10.4 % 14.6 % Bad debt provision 1,251 481 380 160.1 26.5 Net write offs (a) (811 ) (428 ) (314 ) 89.8 36.0 Allowance at end of period $ 1,010 $ 570 $ 517 77.1 10.4 As a percentage of period end receivables 11.1 % 6.6 % 7.7 % Net write offs as a percentage of average receivables (annualized) 9.3 % 5.9 % 5.1 % (a) Net write offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges) less current period principal recoveries. Our 2008 period end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior years product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests, and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk guests. 16  Table of Contents 2007 period end receivables were $8,624 million compared with $6,711 million in 2006, an increase of 28.5 percent. Average receivables in 2007 increased 18.1 percent to $7,275 million from $6,161 million. This growth in receivables measure was driven primarily by a product change from proprietary Target Cards to Target Visa cards for a group of higher credit quality Target Card Guests. A product change to a Target Visa card generally results in a higher receivables balance because it can be used for purchases outside of Target stores and has a higher credit limit. Accounts converted from a Target Card to a Target Visa accounted for approximately 20 percentage points of the growth in period end receivables. The remainder of our year over year receivables growth was primarily due to a reduction in payment rates on non converted accounts. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $866 million at the end of 2008, increasing 33.8 percent, or $219 million from 2007. This increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest rate. In 2007, net interest expense was $647 million compared with $572 million in 2006, an increase of 13.2 percent. This increase related to higher average debt balances, including the debt to fund growth in accounts receivable. The average portfolio interest rate was 5.3 percent in 2008, 6.1 percent in 2007 and 6.2 percent in 2006. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 37.4 percent in 2008, 38.4 percent in 2007 and 38.0 percent in 2006. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate is also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable. The increase in the 2007 effective rate from the prior year was primarily due to lower capital market returns on these investments as compared to 2006. Workforce Reduction In 2008, we recorded a $47 million charge related to workforce reduction actions, approximately $21 million of which related to actions announced in January 2009 affecting our headquarters population. This charge was comprised of severance and benefit costs of $37 million and other expenses, primarily early lease exit costs, of $10 million. At the end of 2008, the remaining liability balance relating to severance costs was approximately $31 million. We believe that the liability will be substantially extinguished by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The liability is recorded as a component of other current liabilities and the expenses are recorded as a component of SG&A. We will incur costs in 2009 for workforce reduction actions announced in 2008 but where team members are required to provide future services. We estimate those costs will be approximately $11 million and generally represent severance and benefits costs to be paid during 2009. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources We continue to fund our operations and growth through a combination of internally generated funds and debt financing. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,430 million in 2008 compared with $4,125 million in 2007. Our 2008 period end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior years product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly 17 Table of Contents reduced credit lines and from notable reductions in card usage. As further described in Note 10, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to a JPMorgan Chase affiliate (JPMC). The interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the transaction. Year end inventory levels decreased $75 million, or 1.1 percent from 2007, reflecting inventory management initiatives responding to declining consumer demand offset by increased inventory levels required to support comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable decreased by 5.7 percent over the same period. During 2008, we repurchased 67.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $3,395 million ($50.49 per share) under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2007 we repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,642 million ($57.24 per share). In November 2008 we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open market share repurchase program. We declared dividends totaling $471 million ($0.62 per share) in 2008, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2007. In 2007 we declared dividends totaling $454 million ($0.54 per share), an increase of 14.6 percent over 2006. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Maintaining strong investment grade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy. Our current debt ratings are as follows: Debt Ratings Standard and Poors Moodys Fitch Long term debt A2 A+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 Securitized receivables (a) Aaa AA n/a (a) These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC. At January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We fund our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and typically use the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. Additionally and as described in Note 10, we sold to JPMC an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately $3.8 billion. We received proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion, reflecting a 7 percent discount. An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2008 or 2007 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities. Most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 31, 2009, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade, or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade. Our interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre tax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SECs applicable rules was 4.3x in 2008, 6.4x in 2007 and 7.1x in 2006. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $3,547 million in 2008, compared with $4,369 million in 2007 and $3,928 million in 2006. This decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores, remodels and technology related assets. Our 2008 capital expenditures include $1,258 million related to stores that will 18 Table of Contents open in 2009 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $1,661 million in 2008 following an increase of $2,664 million in 2007.

(c) Total contractual lease payments include $1,830 million of lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes $164 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2009 or later. Refer to Note 21 for a further description of leases. (d) Estimated tax contingencies of $447 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for 2009, is included in Note 27. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 19 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last in, first out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than six months. Inventory is further described in Note 11. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is earned for a variety of vendor sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and the amount earned. The majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Vendor income is described further in Note 4. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees. We estimate future write offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. We believe that the allowance recorded at January 31, 2009 is sufficient to cover currently anticipated losses. Credit card receivables are described in Note 10. Analysis of long lived and intangible assets for impairment We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually at the store level. An impairment loss on a long lived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounted future cash flows. No material impairments were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed. Insurance/self insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate 20 Table of Contents our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with our insurance policies. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22. Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status, date of hire and or length of service. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine pension and postretirement health care expense for the following plan year. Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" (SFAS 158). The discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in Note 27. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.1 percent increase to the weighted average discount rate used to determine pension and postretirement health care expenses would decrease annual expense by approximately $4 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older, longer service pension eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27. New Accounting Pronouncements 2008 Adoptions In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157, as originally issued, was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157 2, which deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. We adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008, and the adoption had no impact to our consolidated net earnings, cash flows and financial position. Subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 157, the FASB has issued various other FASB Staff Positions and guidance on fair value measurement; the additional guidance has not had an impact on our adoption. We will adopt SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities at the beginning of 2009 and do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We adopted SFAS 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2008, and the adoption had no impact to our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 161, as originally issued, was effective at the beginning of fiscal 21 Table of Contents 2009. However, in October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 133 1 and FIN 45 4, which, amongst other actions, accelerated the effective date of SFAS 161 to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Since SFAS 161 requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities, the adoption of SFAS 161 did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In November 2008, the FASB Staff Position FAS 140 e and FIN 46(R) e, Disclosures about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (the FSP) was published with an effective date for periods ending December 15, 2008. The FSP is intended to enhance currently required disclosures until the pending amendments to SFAS 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," are published. Since the FSP requires only additional disclosures related to certain asset transfers, the adoption of the FSP did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. Future Adoptions In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141(R)), which changes the accounting for business combinations and their effects on the financial statements. SFAS 141(R) will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51" (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as equity in their consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009 We anticipate that the challenging economic and consumer environment we experienced in 2008 will continue into 2009. In the first half of 2009, in our Retail Segment, we expect a continuation of recent sales trends specifically mid single digit declines in overall comparable store sales with stronger growth in our lower margin non discretionary categories than in our higher margin home and apparel categories. This sales performance will likely lead to a moderate decline in our gross margin rate because it is unlikely that we will be able to offset the impact of the adverse sales mix with rate improvements within categories. Even in light of continued strong expense control, we expect a moderate de leveraging in our SG&A expense rate as a result of our expectation for soft comparable store sales. As a result, we expect to generate EBITDA and EBIT in our Retail Segment below last years levels for the first half of the year. In our Credit Card Segment we expect net write offs to stabilize in the range of $300 million in each of the first two quarters of 2009, levels which were anticipated in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of fiscal 2008. We do not anticipate the need to add any meaningful reserves in the foreseeable future, especially in light of the high likelihood that we will experience modest decreases in gross receivables. Overall, we expect to generate moderate rates of profit in the Credit Card Segment in the first two quarters of 2009, though it is not likely to be as strong as the profits generated in the first two quarters of 2008. In light of the current environment, we are being very deliberate in the management and application of cash resources. This means that we have planned for fewer stores to open in 2009, particularly in our October cycle, than we would have in a more robust environment. Specifically, we expect to open about 75 stores in 2009, or about 60 stores net of rebuilds and relocations. Based on these store opening expectations, our base capital investment plan for 2009 envisions investing just over $2 billion, with the possibility that it might be as high as $2.5 billion if we were to see clear and measurable signs of improvement in the economy that lead us to approve incremental store openings in 2010 and beyond. We expect to again generate more than $4 billion in cash from operations in 2009, which, in light of our current suspension of substantially all share repurchase activity, would provide ample cash from internal sources to fund our projected capital investments, pay dividends on our common stock and fund the $1.3 billion of debt that is maturing in 2009, all without the need to access the term debt capital markets during the year. Our expectation is for earnings per share (diluted) in the first two quarters of 2009 to be well below 2008 levels, in line with our experience in the fourth quarter of 2008. Whether our performance will improve in the 22 Table of Contents last two quarters of 2009 will depend on the extent to which economic conditions improve, and in turn to what extent our Retail Segment sales improve, and to a lesser degree when, and to what extent, we begin to experience clear and measurable benefits of recent risk management efforts in the Credit Card Segment. Forward Looking Statements This report contains forward looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward looking statements in this report include: The expected earnings per share (diluted) for the first two quarters of 2009; for our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales trends, gross margin rates, SG&A expense rate, and EBITDA and EBIT; for our Credit Card Segment, our outlook for future write offs of current receivables, profit, and the allowance for doubtful accounts; the expected cash generated from operations in 2009; our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2009; the expected compliance with debt covenants; and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers compensation, property loss, team member medical and dental claims, workforce reduction costs, the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties. All such forward looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10 K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements in this report. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. Our degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and vary in different interest rate environments. At January 31, 2009, our level of floating rate credit card assets exceeded our level of net floating rate debt obligations by approximately $1.3 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a half percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $7 million. See further description in Note 20. We record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically and in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $19 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $18 million at January 31, 2009. The resulting impact on net pension expense would be calculated consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold high quality, long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control our risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. We do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 23  Table of Contents
