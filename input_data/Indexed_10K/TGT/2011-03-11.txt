Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our 2010 Retail Segment sales increased 3.7 percent over last year due to a 2.1 percent comparable store increase combined with the contribution from new stores. Our Retail Segment EBITDA and EBIT increased 4.9 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. In the Credit Card Segment, we achieved a significant increase in segment profit primarily due to declining bad debt expense driven by improved trends in key measures of risk. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,271 million, $5,881 million and $4,430 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We opened 13 new stores and 76 new stores in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010 we remodeled 341 stores, significantly more than the 67 stores we remodeled in 2009. Additionally, during 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 47.8 million and 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share) and $479 million ($48.54 per share), respectively. In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million (Canadian dollars), due in two payments, one in May 2011 and one in September 2011. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. We expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. At January 29, 2011 the value of C$1.00 approximated the value of $1.00. Additionally, in January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of historical financing transactions related to our credit card receivables. Managements Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 14 Table of Contents Analysis of Results of Operations Retail Segment Percent Change Retail Segment Results (millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Sales $ 65,786 $ 63,435 $ 62,884 3.7 % 0.9 % Cost of sales 45,725 44,062 44,157 3.8 (0.2 ) Gross margin 20,061 19,373 18,727 3.5 3.5 SG&A expenses (a) 13,367 12,989 12,838 2.9 1.2 EBITDA 6,694 6,384 5,889 4.9 8.4 Depreciation and amortization 2,065 2,008 1,808 2.8 11.0 EBIT $ 4,629 $ 4,376 $ 4,081 5.8 % 7.3 % EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. These reimbursed amounts were $102 million in 2010, $89 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.

Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for 2010 were $65,786 million, compared with $63,435 million in 2009 and $62,884 million in 2008. All periods were 52 week years. Growth in total sales between 2010 and 2009 resulted from higher comparable store sales and additional stores opened, whereas between 2009 and 2008, growth in total sales resulted from sales from additional stores opened, partially offset by lower comparable store sales. In 2010, deflation affected sales growth by approximately 0.2 percentage points, compared with a deflationary impact of approximately 3.6 percentage points in 2009 and an inflationary impact of 2.2 percentage points in 2008.

The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable store sales are sales from our online business and stores open longer than one year, including: sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable store sales do not include: sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable Store Sales 2010 2009 2008 Comparable store sales change 2.1 % (2.5)% (2.9) % Drivers of changes in comparable store sales: Number of transactions 2.0 % (0.2)% (3.1) % Average transaction amount 0.1 % (2.3)% 0.2 % Units per transaction 2.5 % (1.5)% (2.1) % Selling price per unit (2.3) % (0.8)% 2.3 % The comparable store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length. In 2010, the change in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in the number of transactions and a slight increase in the average transaction amount, reflecting an increase in units per transaction largely offset by a decrease in selling price per unit. In 2009, the change in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount, primarily due to a decrease in the number of units per transaction, as well as a slight decrease in the number of transactions. The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. Beginning April 2010, all new qualified credit card applicants receive the Target Card, and we no longer issue the Target Visa to credit card applicants. Existing Target Visa cardholders are not affected. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. We monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration), because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder of the incremental purchases on the REDcards representing a shift in tender type. REDcard Penetration 2010 2009 2008 Target credit penetration 5.2 % 5.2 % 6.2 % Target debit penetration 0.7 % 0.4 % 0.3 % Total store REDcard penetration 5.9 % 5.6 % 6.5 % Since launching our new 5% REDcard Rewards program in October 2010, we have experienced an increase in REDcard penetration. REDcard penetration for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 7.4 percent compared to 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in cost of sales. Markup is the 16 Table of Contents difference between an items cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions. Our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2010, unchanged from prior year, as margin rates within categories were generally stable and the impact of sales mix was essentially neutral. There were no other significant variances in the drivers of gross margin rate. Our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2009, compared with 29.8 percent in 2008. Our 2009 gross margin rate benefitted from rate improvements within categories, partially offset by the mix impact of faster sales growth in lower margin rate categories (generally product categories of household essentials and food). The impact of rate performance within merchandise categories on gross margin rate was an approximate 1.1 percentage point increase for 2009. This increase is the result of improved markups and reduced markdowns. The impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was an approximate 0.4 percentage point reduction. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. SG&A expense rate was 20.3 percent in 2010 compared with 20.5 percent in 2009 and 20.4 percent in 2008. The change in the rate in 2010 was primarily due to favorable leverage of overall compensation expenses. The change in the SG&A expense rate in 2009 was primarily driven by an approximate 0.4 percentage point impact from an increase in incentive compensation due to better than expected 2009 performance compared with 2008 results, which was partially offset by an approximate 0.2 percentage point impact from sustained productivity gains in our stores. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2010, our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 3.1 percent compared with 3.2 percent in 2009 and 2.9 percent in 2008. The rate was essentially unchanged from the same period last year. In 2009 the increase in the rate was primarily due to accelerated depreciation on assets that were replaced as part of our remodel program.

Our credit card program supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests. Beginning April 2010, all new qualified credit card applicants receive the Target Card, and we no longer issue the Target Visa to credit card applicants. Existing Target Visa cardholders are not affected. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. This new REDcard Rewards program replaced the existing rewards program in which account holders received an initial 10 percent off coupon for opening the account and earned points toward a 10 percent off coupon on subsequent purchases. These changes are intended to simplify the program and to generate profitable incremental retail sales. Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, or the amounts received from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card.

Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. These reimbursed amounts were $102 million in 2010, $89 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment. (b) Amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by Target. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, these amounts exclude $4,335 million, $5,484 million and $4,503 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. (c) ROIC is return on invested capital, and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by Target, expressed as an annualized rate. (d) As an annualized percentage of average gross credit card receivables. 18 Table of Contents Spread Analysis Total Portfolio (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate EBIT $ 624 8.8 % (c) $ 298 3.5 % (c) $ 322 3.7 % (c) LIBOR (a) 0.3 % 0.3 % 2.3 % Spread to LIBOR (b) $ 604 8.5 % (c) $ 270 3.2 % (c) $ 118 1.4 % (c) (a) Balance weighted one month LIBOR. (b) Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. (c) As a percentage of average gross credit card receivables. Our primary measure of segment profit in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables. In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. Effective April 2009, we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to cardholder account balances. Under these terms, finance charges accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than 6%; if the Prime Rate is greater than 6%, finance charges accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread. Because the Prime Rate was less than 6% during 2009, the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed APR subsequent to this terms change. As a result of regulatory actions that impact our portfolio, effective January 2010, we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum APR for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate, and we eliminated penalty pricing for all current, or nondelinquent accounts. Penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time, generally 12 months, and is triggered when a cardholder repeatedly fails to make timely payments. Additionally, beginning in August 2010 late fee limitations went into effect that resulted in reduced late fee revenue. In 2010, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $541 million from $201 million, driven mostly by favorability in bad debt expense. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,604 million, a decrease of $318 million, or 16.5 percent, from the prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average receivables as well as reduced late fees. Segment expenses were $980 million, a decrease of $644 million, or 39.7 percent, from prior year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense due to lower actual and expected write offs. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables. In 2009, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $201 million from $155 million as a result of improved portfolio performance (Spread to LIBOR) and significantly lower funding costs. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,922 million, a decrease of $143 million, or 6.9 percent, from the prior year. The decrease in revenue was driven by a lower Prime Rate, lower average receivables, higher finance charge and late fee write offs, and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late 2008 and April 2009. Segment expenses were $1,624 million, a decrease of $118 million, or 6.8 percent, from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses, on both a dollar and rate basis. Segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower LIBOR rate compared to the prior year. 19  Table of Contents Receivables Rollforward Analysis Percent Change (millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Beginning gross credit card receivables $ 7,982 $ 9,094 $ 8,624 (12.2 )% 5.4 % Charges at Target 3,699 3,553 4,207 4.1 (15.5 ) Charges at third parties 5,815 6,763 8,542 (14.0 ) (20.8 ) Payments (11,283 ) (12,065 ) (13,482 ) (6.5 ) (10.5 ) Other 630 637 1,203 (1.1 ) (47.1 ) Period end gross credit card receivables $ 6,843 $ 7,982 $ 9,094 (14.3 )% (12.2 )% Average gross credit card receivables $ 7,106 $ 8,351 $ 8,695 (14.9 )% (4.0 )% Accounts with three or more payments (60+ days) past due as a percentage of period end credit card receivables 4.2 % 6.3 % 6.1 % Accounts with four or more payments (90+ days) past due as a percentage of period end gross credit card receivables 3.1 % 4.7 % 4.3 % Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Percent Change (millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Allowance at beginning of period $ 1,016 $ 1,010 $ 570 0.6 % 77.1 % Bad debt expense 528 1,185 1,251 (55.4 ) (5.3 ) Write offs (a) (1,007 ) (1,287 ) (912 ) (21.8 ) 41.1 Recoveries (a) 153 108 101 40.2 8.3 Allowance at end of period $ 690 $ 1,016 $ 1,010 (32.1 )% 0.6 % As a percentage of period end gross credit card receivables 10.1 % 12.7 % 11.1 % Net write offs as a percentage of average gross credit card receivables (annualized) 12.0 % 14.1 % 9.3 % (a) Write offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges), and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously written off balances. These amounts combined represent net write offs. Our 2010 period end gross credit card receivables were $6,843 million compared to $7,982 million in 2009, a decrease of 14.3 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 14.9 percent compared with 2009 levels. In response to regulatory changes and credit card industry trends, we have undertaken risk management and underwriting initiatives that have reduced available credit lines for higher risk cardholders. Additionally, we have experienced an increase in payment rates and a decrease in charges at third parties. Our 2009 period end gross credit card receivables were $7,982 million compared with $9,094 million in 2008, a decrease of 12.2 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 4.0 percent compared with 2008 levels. This change was driven by the tighter risk management and underwriting initiatives described above, fewer new accounts being opened, and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests, partially offset by the impact of lower payment rates. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense, which includes the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables detailed in the Credit Card Segment Results above, was $757 million for 2010, decreasing 5.5 percent, or $44 million from 2009 due to lower average debt balances and a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long term debt in 2009, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate of 5.3 percent in 2010, compared with 4.8 percent in 2009. In 2009, net interest expense was $801 million, decreasing 7.5 percent, or $65 million from 2008. This decline was due to a lower average portfolio interest rate of 4.8 percent in 2009, compared with 5.3 percent in 2008, partially offset by a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long term debt. 20 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.1 percent in 2010 and 35.7 percent in 2009. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters, which reduced income tax expense by approximately $100 million. Our effective income tax rate was 35.7 percent in 2009 and 37.4 percent in 2008. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in 2009, compared with nondeductible losses in 2008. The 2009 effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our period end cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,712 million compared with $2,200 million in 2009. Marketable securities of $1,129 million and $1,617 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our marketable securities. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain limitations on the aggregate dollars invested and percentage of total fund value held when making short term investment decisions. Our 2010 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,271 million in 2010 compared with $5,881 million in 2009. This cash flow, combined with our prior year end cash position and the debt issuance described below, allowed us to fund capital expenditures of $2,129 million and pay off $2,259 million of debt. In addition, in 2010 we increased our share repurchases and raised dividends paid to our shareholders. Our 2010 period end gross credit card receivables were $6,843 million compared with $7,982 million in 2009, a decrease of 14.3 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 14.9 percent compared with 2009 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the Credit Card Segment above. This trend and the factors influencing it are likely to continue into 2011. Due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables, Target Receivables LLC (TR LLC), formerly known as Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), using cash flows from the receivables, repaid an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) $566 million and $163 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, under the terms of our agreement with them as described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the receivables balance continues to decline, TR LLC expects to continue to pay JPMC a prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent. Year end inventory levels increased $417 million, or 5.8 percent from 2009. Inventory levels were higher to support traffic driving strategic initiatives, such as our expanded food assortment in general merchandise stores and pharmacy, in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable increased by $115 million, or 1.8 percent over the same period. During 2010, we repurchased 47.8 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share) under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2009, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $479 million ($48.54 per share). We paid dividends totaling $609 million in 2010 and $496 million in 2009, an increase of 22.7 percent. We declared dividends totaling $659 million ($0.92 per share) in 2010, an increase of 31.1 percent over 2009. In 2009, we declared dividends totaling $503 million ($0.67 per share), an increase of 6.8 percent over 2008. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. As described in Note 19, in July 2010, we issued $1 billion of long term debt at 3.875% that matures in July 2020. There were no amounts issued in 2009. 21 Table of Contents Our ability to access the long term debt, commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided ample sources of liquidity to Target in the past. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the economic environment, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. The ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing. As of January 29, 2011 our credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Standard and Poors Moodys Fitch Long term debt A2 A+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 Securitized receivables (a) Aa2 n/a n/a (a) These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC. If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above. As a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SECs applicable rules was 6.1x in 2010, 5.1x in 2009 and 4.3x in 2008. At January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In past years, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. In 2010 and 2009 we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds and the long term debt issuance indicated above. Commercial Paper (millions) 2010 2009 Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year $ $ 112 Average amount outstanding during the year 1 Amount outstanding at year end Weighted average interest rate 0.2 % An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2010 or 2009 under this facility. Most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 29, 2011, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade, or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade. We believe our sources of liquidity will be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives during 2011, including our plan to enter the Canadian retail market by paying C$1,825 million to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites currently operated by Zellers Inc. We may issue new long term debt for these and other initiatives, and we anticipate ample access to long term financing. Further, in January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio, which may provide additional funding. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables 22 Table of Contents portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $2,129 million in 2010 compared with $1,729 million in 2009 and $3,547 million in 2008. This increase was driven by higher capital expenditures for remodels partially offset by reduced expenditures for new stores. Our 2010 capital expenditures include $482 million related to stores that will open in 2011 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $213 million in 2010 following a decrease of $475 million in 2009. Capital Expenditures (millions) 2010 2009 2008 New stores $ 574 $ 899 $ 2,341 Remodels and expansions 966 294 284 Information technology, distribution and other 589 536 922 Total $ 2,129 $ 1,729 $ 3,547 In connection with the previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in Canada, we expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, primarily during 2012 and 2013, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. 23  Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies At January 29, 2011, our contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Recorded Contractual Obligations: Long term debt (a) Unsecured $ 11,287 $ 106 $ 2,002 $ 28 $ 9,151 Nonrecourse 4,061 4,061 Capital lease obligations (b) 617 32 66 62 457 Real estate liabilities (c) 65 65 Deferred compensation (d) 440 44 96 106 194 Tax contingencies (e) Unrecorded Contractual Obligations: Interest payments long term debt Unsecured 10,080 678 1,214 1,127 7,061 Nonrecourse (f) 101 32 69 Operating leases (b) 3,954 190 376 288 3,100 Real estate obligations (g) 243 209 34 Purchase obligations (h) 1,907 713 747 348 99 Payment for Canadian leasehold interests (i) 1,825 1,825 Future contributions to retirement plans (j) Contractual obligations $ 34,580 $ 3,894 $ 8,665 $ 1,959 $ 20,062 (a) Required principal payments only. Excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in long term debt, as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules. Principal includes the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC at the principal amount. In the event of a decrease in the receivables principal balance, accelerated repayment of this obligation may occur. (b) Total contractual lease payments include $1,949 million of operating lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $28 million and $241 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2011 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. (c) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (d) Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. (e) Estimated tax contingencies of $397 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. (f) These payments vary with LIBOR and are calculated assuming LIBOR of 0.25 percent plus a spread, for each year outstanding. (g) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (h) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. (i) In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million. At January 29, 2011 the value of C$1.00 approximated the value of $1.00. This commitment does not include future minimum lease payments on sites that may be selected in 2011. (j) We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of January 29, 2011. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. 24 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements or financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last in, first out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, customer preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $7,596 million and $7,179 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, and is further described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is earned for a variety of vendor sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $517 million and $390 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees. We estimate future write offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the 25 Table of Contents factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. During 2010, we continued risk management and underwriting initiatives that reduced available credit lines for higher risk cardholders. In addition, we experienced an increase in payment rates and a decrease in charge activity from reductions in card usage by our guests. As a result of these trends, our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our credit card receivables decreased $326 million, from $1,016 million, or 12.7 percent of gross credit card receivables, at January 30, 2010 to $690 million, or 10.1 percent of gross credit card receivables, at January 29, 2011. Credit card receivables and our allowance for doubtful accounts are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long lived assets Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell as of January 29, 2011 would result in additional impairment of approximately $12 million in 2010. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long lived assets. Goodwill and intangible assets We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth rates, and other factors. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, we had $223 million and $239 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. While we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets exceeds its carrying value, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or other factors could result in impairment losses. Insurance/self insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers compensation and general liability accrual was $628 million and $653 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self insurance expense by approximately $30 million in 2010. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining whether it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for tax positions considered uncertain, including interest and penalties, were $397 million and $579 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status, date of hire and or length of service. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long term rate of return used. A one percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $24 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $23 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older, longer service pension eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal contingencies We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. New Accounting Pronouncements Recent Adoptions In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, "Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140" (SFAS 166), codified in the Transfers and Servicing accounting principles, which amends the derecognition guidance in former FASB Statement No. 140 and eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities. We adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)" (SFAS 167), codified in the Consolidation accounting principles, which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments significantly affected the overall consolidation analysis under former FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). We adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and the adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. 27 Table of Contents Outlook Our outlook is based on the application of business judgment in light of current business trends, our assumptions regarding the macroeconomic environment, and estimates of the impact of current initiatives, the most significant of which are our store remodel program, the new 5 percent REDcard Rewards program, and our planned Canadian expansion. In the Retail Segment, we expect that comparable store sales will increase in the 4 to 5 percent range in 2011. We expect that our store remodel program will contribute incremental comparable store sales, and net of the adverse impact of remodel disruption, this impact will grow to a run rate of about 1.5 percentage points as we progress through the year. Separately we expect that the sales contribution of our 5% REDcard Rewards program will grow more rapidly in its importance, adding up to 2 percentage points to our same store sales growth later in 2011. These estimates are based on extrapolations of the current performance of these programs. In 2011 we expect to produce a full year EBIT margin rate consistent with 2010, due to favorable leverage of SG&A and depreciation and amortization expenses offsetting the gross margin rate declines associated with our store remodel and new rewards strategies. This offsetting impact is unlikely to occur in the spring, particularly in the first quarter, resulting in modest pressure on EBIT margin rate in the spring, and modest favorability on this measure in the fall. In our Credit Card Segment, we expect receivables will continue to decline in 2011, with the pace of the decline moderating as the year progresses. We expect that the allowance for doubtful accounts will continue to decline in 2011 as well, due to this decline in receivables and expected continued improvement in portfolio risks. We also expect measures of our rate of portfolio profitability to remain strong in 2011. Additionally, in January 2011 we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target. In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million, due in two payments, one in May 2011 and one in September 2011. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. We expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. Our direct costs associated with entry into Canada may add expenses equating to an earnings per share (EPS) equivalent in the range of $0.10 for 2011, an estimate that will continue to evolve over time. We currently believe the aggregate effect of our Canadian expansion could result in a $0.15 to $0.20 unfavorable impact on 2011 EPS, reflecting direct incremental expenses and the indirect impact of the Canadian investment on the pace of share repurchase. We expect that the 2012 dilutive EPS impact of the Canadian expansion will exceed the 2011 dilutive EPS impact, due primarily to a full year of lease related expenses. We expect 2011 capital expenditures related to our U.S. retail operations to be approximately $2.5 billion, driven primarily by a larger remodel program. We expect to open 21 new stores in the U.S. in 2011, adding approximately 15 new locations net of closings and relocations. We also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase plan, although at a slower pace due to our Canadian expansion, investing in the range of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion during 2011. The timing and amount of share repurchase activity will be dependent on market conditions and the amount of future net earnings and cash flows. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36 to 37 percent. Forward Looking Statements This report contains forward looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward looking statements in this report include: For our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales, comparable store sales trends, including the impact of our store remodel and 5% REDcard Rewards programs, and EBIT margin rates; for our Credit Card Segment, our outlook for year end gross credit card receivables, future write offs of current receivables, rate of portfolio 28 Table of Contents profitability, the allowance for doubtful accounts, improvement in portfolio risks, and the pursuit of a portfolio sale; on a consolidated basis, details on the expected investment in Canada and its impact on our results, statements regarding the adequacy of our sources of liquidity, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2011, the expected effective income tax rate, the expected compliance with debt covenants, our intentions regarding future dividends, our expected future share based compensation expense, our expected return on plan assets, our expected expense, contributions and benefit payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental, the potential impact of changes in our critical accounting estimates, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, and the resolution of tax uncertainties. All such forward looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10 K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements in this report. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. The degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments. At January 29, 2011, the amount of floating rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating rate debt obligations by approximately $2 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 29, 2011, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $2 million. See further description in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 29, 2011, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $10 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $25 million at January 29, 2011. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold high quality, long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. 29 Table of Contents We do not currently have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. Our previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in Canada will expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar beginning in 2011. Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 30  Table of Contents
