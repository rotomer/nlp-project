Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Consolidated revenues were $69,865 million for 2011, an increase of $2,475 million or 3.7 percent from the prior year. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes for 2011 increased by $70 million or 1.3 percent over 2010 to $5,322 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,434 million, $5,271 million and $5,881 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in 2011 increased 7.0 percent to $4.28 from $4.00 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which we believe is useful in providing period to period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations, increased 14.3 percent to $4.41 in 2011 from $3.86 in the prior year. Earnings Per Share Percent Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 4.28 $ 4.00 $ 3.30 7.0 % 21.4 % Adjustments (a) 0.13 (0.14 ) (0.04 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.41 $ 3.86 $ 3.26 14.3 % 18.4 % Note: A reconciliation of non GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 20. (a)Adjustments represent the diluted EPS impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. Our financial results for 2011 in our U.S. Retail Segment reflect increased sales of 4.1 percent over the same period last year due to a 3.0 percent comparable store increase combined with the contribution from new stores. In 2011 we experienced a slight reduction in U.S. Retail Segment EBITDA margin rate compared to 2010, due primarily to a decrease in gross margin rate, partially offset by a favorable selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rate. U.S. Retail Segment EBIT margin rate in 2011 was consistent with the 2010 rate. We opened 21 new stores in 2011 (13 net of 5 relocations and 3 closures). During 2010, we opened 13 new stores (10 net of 1 relocation and 2 closures). In the U.S. Credit Card Segment, we achieved an increase in segment profit primarily due to declining bad debt expense driven by improved trends in key measures of risk in our accounts receivable portfolio. 14 Table of Contents Our Canadian Segment was initially reported in our first quarter 2011 financial results, as a result of entering into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada operated by Zellers Inc. (Zellers). We acquired leasehold interests in 189 Zellers sites for $1,861 million, and sold our right to acquire 54 of these sites to third party retailers and landlords for $225 million. These transactions resulted in a final net purchase price of $1,636 million. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 125 to 135 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. During 2011, Canadian Segment start up costs totaled $74 million, and primarily consisted of compensation, benefits and consulting expenses. These expenses are reported in selling, general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Analysis of Results of Operations U.S. Retail Segment U.S. Retail Segment Results Percent Change (millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 Sales $ 68,466 $ 65,786 $ 63,435 4.1 % 3.7 % Cost of sales 47,860 45,725 44,062 4.7 3.8 Gross margin 20,606 20,061 19,373 2.7 3.5 SG&A expenses (a) 13,774 13,367 12,989 3.0 2.9 EBITDA 6,832 6,694 6,384 2.1 4.9 Depreciation and amortization 2,067 2,065 2,008 0.1 2.8 EBIT $ 4,765 $ 4,629 $ 4,376 2.9 % 5.8 % EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBIT is earnings before interest expense and income taxes. Note: See Note 28 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes. (a)Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which the U.S. Retail Segment charges the U.S. Credit Card Segment to better align with the attributes of this program. Loyalty program charges were $258 million in 2011, $102 million in 2010 and $89 million in 2009. In all periods, these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the U.S. Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the U.S. Credit Card Segment. U.S. Retail Segment Rate Analysis 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin rate 30.1 % 30.5 % 30.5 % SG&A expense rate 20.1 20.3 20.5 EBITDA margin rate 10.0 10.2 10.1 Depreciation and amortization expense rate 3.0 3.1 3.2 EBIT margin rate 7.0 7.0 6.9 Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the U.S. Retail Segment for 2011 were $68,466 million, compared with $65,786 million in 2010 and $63,435 million in 2009. All periods were 52 week years. Growth in total sales between 2011 and 2010, as well as between 2010 and 2009, resulted from higher comparable store sales and additional stores opened. Inflation did not materially affect sales during 2011 or 2010. During 2009, we experienced a deflationary impact on sales of approximately 3.6 percentage points. Refer to the Merchandise section in Item 1, Business, for additional product category information. 15 Table of Contents Comparable store sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores by measuring the change in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable, prior year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable store sales are sales from our online business and stores open longer than one year, including: sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open (including our current store remodel program) sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes Comparable store sales do not include: sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget store format sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed Comparable Store Sales 2011 2010 2009 Comparable store sales change 3.0 % 2.1% (2.5) % Drivers of change in comparable store sales: Number of transactions 0.4 2.0 (0.2) Average transaction amount 2.6 0.1 (2.3) Units per transaction 2.3 2.5 (1.5) Selling price per unit 0.3 (2.3 ) (0.8) In 2011, the change in comparable store sales was driven by a slight increase in the number of transactions and an increase in the average transaction amount, reflecting an increase in units per transaction and a slight increase in selling price per unit. In 2010, the change in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in the number of transactions and a slight increase in the average transaction amount, reflecting an increase in units per transaction largely offset by a decrease in selling price per unit. The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. Our U.S. Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards: the Target Visa Credit Card and the Target Credit Card (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards&reg;. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. We monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration), because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder representing a shift in tender type. REDcard Penetration 2011 2010 2009 Target Credit Cards 6.8 % 5.2 % 5.2 % Target Debit Card 2.5 0.7 0.4 % Total Store REDcard Penetration 9.3 % 5.9 % 5.6 % Gross Margin Rate Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an items cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous 16 Table of Contents price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions. Our gross margin rate was 30.1 percent in 2011, decreasing from 30.5 percent in the prior year, reflecting the impact of our integrated growth strategies of 5% REDcard Rewards and remodel program, partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories. The REDcard Rewards program reduces category gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive 5% off on virtually all items purchased in our stores and online. The remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a stronger than average mix in lower than average gross margin rate product categories, primarily food. Our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2010, unchanged from prior year, as margin rates within categories were generally stable and the impact of sales mix was essentially neutral. There were no other significant variances in the drivers of gross margin rate. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our selling, general and administrative expense rate represents SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in SG&A expenses. SG&A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. SG&A expense rate was 20.1 percent in 2011 compared with 20.3 percent in 2010 and 20.5 percent in 2009. The change in the rate in 2011 was primarily due to increased charges to the U.S. Credit Segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense. The change in the SG&A expense rate in 2010 was primarily due to favorable leverage of overall compensation expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2011, our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 3.0 percent compared with 3.1 percent in 2010 and 3.2 percent in 2009.

Our credit card program supports our core retail operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout, every day, when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com. Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, which are amounts received from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card. In January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. In January 2012, we announced that we temporarily suspended our efforts to sell the receivables portfolio until later in 2012. We intend to execute a transaction only if appropriate strategic and financial conditions are met, and we will classify the credit card receivables portfolio as held for sale when a transaction that allows us to meet our objectives has been agreed upon with a potential buyer.

(b)Amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by Target. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, these amounts exclude $3,801 million, $4,335 million and $5,484 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. (c)ROIC is return on invested capital, and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by Target, expressed as an annualized rate.

(c)As a percentage of average gross credit card receivables. 18  Table of Contents Our primary measure of segment profit is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables. In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. In 2011, segment profit increased to $606 million from $541 million, driven mostly by a decline in bad debt expense, partially offset by lower total revenues. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,399 million, a decrease of $205 million, or 12.8 percent, from the prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average receivables resulting in reduced finance charge revenue. Segment expenses were $721 million, a decrease of $259 million, or 26.5 percent, from prior year driven by lower bad debt expense due to improved trends in key measures of risk. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables. In 2010, segment profit increased to $541 million from $201 million, driven mostly by favorability in bad debt expense. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,604 million, a decrease of $318 million, or 16.5 percent, from the prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average receivables as well as reduced late fees. Segment expenses were $980 million, a decrease of $644 million, or 39.7 percent, from prior year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense due to lower actual and expected write offs. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables.

These amounts combined represent net write offs. 19 Table of Contents Period end and average gross receivables have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in Target Visa Credit Card charges at third parties, partially offset by an increase in charges at Target over the past two years. The decrease in charges on our credit cards at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new Target Visa accounts and we undertook risk management and underwriting initiatives that reduced available credit lines for higher risk cardholders during 2009 and 2010. We expect to report period over period declines in segment profit in 2012, primarily because our 2011 results benefited from significant allowance reductions. Canadian Segment During 2011, start up costs totaled $74 million and primarily consisted of compensation, benefits and consulting expenses. These expenses are reported in SG&A expense within the consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, we recorded $48 million in depreciation for 2011 related to capital lease assets and leasehold interests acquired in our Zellers asset purchase. We have begun to invest capital to prepare for site renovation, establish supply chain capabilities and build supporting infrastructure. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense, including interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables detailed in the U.S. Credit Card Segment Results above, was $866 million for 2011, increasing 14.4 percent, or $109 million from 2010. This increase is due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt, $44 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases and higher average debt balances, partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate. In 2010, net interest expense was $757 million, decreasing 5.5 percent or $44 million from 2009 due to lower average debt balances and a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long term debt in 2009, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 34.3 percent in 2011 and 35.1 percent in 2010. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate. This was slightly offset by the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada which are tax effected at a lower rate than the U.S. rate. Various income tax matters were resolved in 2011 and 2010 which reduced tax expense by $85 million and $102 million, respectively. A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our effective income tax rate was 35.1 percent in 2010 and 35.7 percent in 2009. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters, as noted above. We expect a 2012 consolidated effective income tax rate of 36.7 percent to 37.7 percent, excluding the impact of resolution of income tax matters. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions. To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. We believe this information is useful in providing period to period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Non GAAP adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis 20 Table of Contents of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non GAAP adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

The sum of the non GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding. (a)Represents interest expense, net of interest income, not included in U.S. Credit Card segment profit. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, U.S. Credit Card segment profit included $72 million, $83 million and $97 million of interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables, respectively. These amounts, along with other interest expense, equal consolidated GAAP interest expense. (b)In 2011, taxes are allocated to our business segments based on income tax rates applicable to the operations of the segment for the period. (c)For 2011, 2010 and 2009, average diluted shares outstanding were 683.9 million, 729.4 million and 754.8 million, respectively. (d)Represents the loss on early retirement of debt. (e)Represents the effect of resolution of income tax matters. The 2011 and 2009 results also include tax effects of $32 million and $6 million, respectively, related to losses on early retirement of debt. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our period end cash and cash equivalents balance was $794 million compared with $1,712 million in 2010. Short term investments (highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase) of $194 million and $1,129 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. 21 Table of Contents Our 2011 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,434 million in 2011 compared with $5,271 million in 2010. During 2011, Target issued $3.5 billion of debt that matures between January 2013 and January 2022. This cash flow, combined with our prior year end cash position, allowed us to fund capital expenditures, retire outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program. During 2011, we also completed our real estate transaction with Zellers. This transaction resulted in a final net purchase price of $1,636 million. Our 2011 period end gross credit card receivables were $6,357 million compared with $6,843 million in 2010, a decrease of 7.1 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2011 decreased 11.1 percent compared with 2010 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the U.S. Credit Card Segment above. During 2011 we retired our 2008 credit card financing with JPMorgan Chase by making principal and make whole payments totaling $3,080 million. As of January 28, 2012, $1 billion of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties. We intend to pursue a sale of our credit card receivables portfolio, which may provide additional liquidity in 2012. Year end inventory levels increased $322 million, or 4.2 percent from 2010. Inventory levels were higher to support traffic driving strategic initiatives, such as our remodel program, including expanded food assortment and pharmacy offerings, in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable increased by $232 million, or 3.5 percent over the same period. During 2011, we repurchased 37.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $1,894 million ($50.89 per share) under a $10 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2010, we repurchased 47.8 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share). During January 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase plan. We expect to begin repurchasing shares under this new authorization upon completion of the current program. We intend to complete this new program primarily through open market transactions in the next 2 to 3 years. We paid dividends totaling $750 million in 2011 and $609 million in 2010, an increase of 23.1 percent. We declared dividends totaling $777 million ($1.15 per share) in 2011, an increase of 17.8 percent over 2010. In 2010, we declared dividends totaling $659 million ($0.92 per share), an increase of 31.1 percent over 2009. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long term debt, commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. The ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing. As of January 28, 2012 our credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Standard and Poors Moodys Fitch Long term debt A2 A+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F2 If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above. As a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio was 5.9x in 2011, 6.1x in 2010 and 5.1x in 2009. 22 Table of Contents In 2011, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. In 2010, we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds and long term debt issuance. Commercial Paper (millions) 2011 2010 Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year $ 1,211 $ Average amount outstanding during the year 244 Amount outstanding at year end Weighted average interest rate 0.11 % An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in October 2011, which will expire in October 2016. This new revolving credit facility replaced a $2 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2011 or 2010 under either facility. Most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants, and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, at January 28, 2012, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade, or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade. We expect approximately $3.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2012, reflecting an estimated $2.5 billion in our U.S. Retail Segment and approximately $800 million in our Canadian Segment. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives during 2012, and we continue to anticipate ample access to long term financing. See the Commitments and Contingencies table on page 24 for detailed information on material commitments and contingencies as of January 28, 2012. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $4,368 million in 2011 compared with $2,129 million in 2010 and $1,729 million in 2009. This increase was driven by our purchase of Zellers leases in Canada as well as store remodels. Capital Expenditures (a) 2011 (millions) U.S. Canada Total 2010 2009 New stores $ 439 $ 1,619 $ 2,058 $ 574 $ 899 Remodels and expansions 1,289 1,289 966 294 Information technology, distribution and other 748 273 1,021 589 536 Total $ 2,476 $ 1,892 $ 4,368 $ 2,129 $ 1,729 (a)See Note 28 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures by segment. 23  Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies At January 28, 2012, our contractual obligations were as follows: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Recorded Contractual Obligations: Long term debt (a) Unsecured $ 14,680 $ 3,001 $ 1,502 $ 778 $ 9,399 Nonrecourse 1,000 750 250 Capital lease obligations (b) 4,340 122 241 241 3,736 Real estate liabilities (c) 54 54 Deferred compensation (d) 455 47 103 114 191 Tax contingencies (e) Unrecorded Contractual Obligations: Interest payments long term debt Unsecured 9,722 691 1,204 1,161 6,666 Nonrecourse 4 4 Operating lease (b) 3,888 194 354 295 3,045 Real estate obligations (f) 430 301 129 Purchase obligations (g) 1,396 492 782 28 94 Future contributions to retirement plans (h) Contractual obligations $ 35,969 $ 5,656 $ 4,565 $ 2,617 $ 23,131 (a)Required principal payments only. Excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in long term debt, as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules. (b)Total contractual lease payments include $2,894 million and $1,910 million of capital lease payments and operating lease payments, respectively, related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $828 million and $171 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2012 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. (c)Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (d)Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. (e)Estimated tax contingencies of $318 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. (f)Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (g)Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. (h)We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of January 28, 2012. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements or financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially all inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last in, first out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise groupings ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, customer preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $7,918 million and $7,596 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively, and is further described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Vendor income receivable Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is earned for a variety of vendor sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $589 million and $517 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees. We estimate future write offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all past due accounts accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. Our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our credit card receivables decreased $260 million, from $690 million, or 10.1 percent of gross credit card receivables, at January 29, 2011 to $430 million, or 6.8 percent of gross credit card 25 Table of Contents receivables, at January 28, 2012. Credit card receivables and our allowance for doubtful accounts are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long lived assets Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell as of January 28, 2012 would result in additional impairment of $6 million in 2011. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long lived assets. Insurance/self insurance We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers compensation and general liability accrual was $646 million and $628 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self insurance expense by $32 million in 2011. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. Income taxes We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining whether it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for tax positions considered uncertain, including interest and penalties, were $318 million and $397 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and postretirement health care accounting We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status, date of hire and or length of service. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0% is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long term investment performance and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was 5.1 percent, 7.8 percent and 8.3 percent for the 5 year, 10 year and 15 year periods, respectively. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long term rate of return used. A one percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by $26 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Historically, 26 Table of Contents this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by $25 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older, longer service pension eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal contingencies We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. New Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements, although we will be presenting a separate Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with Accounting Standard Update 2011 05, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)" beginning in 2012. Forward Looking Statements This report contains forward looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward looking statements in this report include: For our U.S. Credit Card Segment, aggregate portfolio risks and the level of, the allowance for doubtful accounts, anticipated segment profit, and the pursuit and timing of a portfolio sale; for our Canadian Segment, our performance, timing and amount of future capital investments in Canada; on a consolidated basis, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the continued execution of our share repurchase program and the expected duration of the approved programs, our expected capital expenditures, the expected effective income tax rate, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the impact of future changes in foreign currency, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers compensation, property loss, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, including foreign net operating loss carryforwards, and the resolution of tax matters. All such forward looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10 K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements in this report. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement. 27 Table of Contents  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we generally maintain levels of floating rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. The degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments. At January 28, 2012, the amount of floating rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating rate debt obligations by approximately $2 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 28, 2012, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and short term investments, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $2 million. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 19 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 28, 2012, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $9 million. In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $29 million at January 28, 2012. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high quality, long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged 35 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. As more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. Our investment in Canada during 2011 has exposed us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar that we were not exposed to in previous years. Similar foreign currency risk will exist as new Target stores are opened in Canada and inventory is purchased in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. During 2011, gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant. Currently, we do not have significant direct exposure to other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in U.S. dollars. There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. 28  Table of Contents
