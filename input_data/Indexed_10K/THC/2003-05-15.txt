ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS STRATEGIES & OUTLOOK OPERATING STRATEGIES Our mission and objective is to provide quality health care services within existing regulatory and managed care environments that are responsive to the needs of the communities we serve. We believe that competition among health care providers occurs primarily at the local level. A hospitals competitive position within the geographic area in which it operates is affected by a number of competitive factors, including, but not limited to: the scope, breadth and quality of services a hospital offers to its patients and physicians; the number, quality and specialties of the physicians who refer patients to the hospital; nurses and other health care professionals employed by the hospital or on the hospitals staff; its reputation; its managed care contracting relationships; the extent to which it is part of an integrated health care delivery system; its location; the location and number of competitive facilities and other health care alternatives; the physical condition of its buildings and improvements; the quality, age and state of the art of its medical equipment; its parking or proximity to public transportation; the length of time it has been a part of the community; and its prices for services. Accordingly, we tailor our local strategies to address these competitive factors. We adjust these strategies as needed in response to changes in the economic climate in which we operate and the success or failure of our various efforts. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted a new method for calculating Medicare outlier payments (see page 35); we have restructured our operating divisions and regions; and we have realigned our senior executive management team. On March 10, 2003, we announced the consolidation of our operating divisions from three to two, with five new underlying regions. Our new Eastern Division will consist of three regions Florida, Central Northeast and Southern States. These regions will initially include 59 of our general hospitals located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee. Our new Western Division will consist of two regions California and Texas and will initially include 55 of our hospitals located in California, Nebraska, Nevada and Texas. In March 2003, we also announced a series of initiatives to sharpen our strategic focus, reduce operating expenses, and accelerate repurchases of our common stock. We plan to divest or consolidate 14 general hospitals that no longer fit our core operating strategy of building competitive networks of quality hospitals in major markets. We intend to use the proceeds from these divestitures to repurchase our common stock and repay indebtedness. Our operating expense reduction plan consists of (1) staff and expense reductions above the hospital level, as well as reductions in hospital departments that are not directly involved with patient care, (2) leveraging our size and strength to gain cost savings as well as enhanced levels of service through a comprehensive nurse agency contracting program, (3) changes in corporate travel policies, and (4) leveraging our regional strength to reduce the cost of energy procurement. We presently estimate that these plans will result in future savings of approximately $100 million annually. PRICING APPROACH In fiscal 2000, certain of our hospitals began to significantly increase gross charges. We believe that this practice, combined with the Medicare prescribed formula for determining Medicare outlier payments, contributed to those hospitals receiving outlier payments that exceeded the norm. (Medicare outlier payments are described in more detail in the Government Programs section, page 33. 31 Gross charges are retail charges. They are not the same as actual pricing, and they generally do not reflect what a hospital is ultimately paid for providing patient care. Hospitals typically receive amounts that are negotiated by insurance companies or are set by the government. Gross charges are used to calculate Medicare outlier payments and to determine certain elements of managed care contracts (such as stop loss payments). And, because Medicare requires a hospitals gross charges to be the same for all patients (regardless of payor category), gross charges are also what hospitals charge self pay patients. In early December 2002, we announced a new pricing approach for our hospitals. The new approach de emphasizes gross charges and refocuses on actual pricing. We believe our hospitals pricing practices are, and have been, in compliance with Medicare rules. However, by de emphasizing gross charges and refocusing on actual pricing, the new pricing approach should create a structure with a larger fixed component. Our new approach includes the following components: Freezing the current gross charges at our hospitals through May 31, 2003. Supporting proposed changes in current Medicare rules regarding Medicare outlier payments. Negotiating simpler managed care contracts with higher per diem or case rates and with less emphasis on stop loss and other payments tied to gross charges. Allowing hospitals to offer rates to uninsured patients that are similar to the local market rates that hospitals receive from managed care contracts (subject to approval by the federal government and certain states). In addition to having a new pricing approach, on January 6, 2003, we announced to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") that we had voluntarily adopted a new method for calculating Medicare outlier payments, retroactive to January 1, 2003. Using this new method, Medicare reimburses our hospitals in amounts equivalent to those amounts we anticipate receiving once the expected changes by CMS to Medicare outlier formulas are implemented. We decided to do this now to demonstrate our good faith and to support CMSs likely industrywide solution to the outlier issue. (See "Outlier Payments" in the Government Programs section, page 33, for further information on developments regarding the expected CMS changes.) In the past, our hospitals managed care contracts were primarily charge based. Over many years, some of them have evolved into contracts based primarily on negotiated, fixed per diem rates or case rates, combined with stop loss payments (for high cost patients) and pass through payments (for high cost devices and pharmaceuticals). Our hospitals have thousands of managed care contracts with various renewal/expiration dates. A majority of those contracts are "evergreen" contracts. Evergreen contracts extend automatically every year, but may be renegotiated or terminated by either party after 90 to 120 days notice. In general, our new pricing approach will not involve any broad rollback of charges. Our new pricing approach is intended to create a reimbursement structure with a larger fixed component that will become less dependent on gross charges. We expect that this new approach will provide a more predictable and sustainable payment structure for us. Although we believe that our new pricing approach will continue to allow for increases in prices and continued growth in net operating revenues in the future, we do not expect that the growth rates experienced in the past two years can be sustained. Additionally, our proposal is new in the industry and may take time to implement. We can offer no assurances that our managed care contracting parties will agree to the changes we propose or any changes that result in higher prices. Nor can we offer assurances that this new pricing approach, in 32 the form implemented, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. OUTLOOK To address all the changes impacting the health care industry, while continuing to provide quality care to patients, we have implemented strategies to reduce inefficiencies, create synergies, obtain additional business, and control costs. Such strategies include selective acquisitions, sales or closures of certain facilities, the enhancement of integrated health care delivery systems, hospital cost control programs, and overhead reduction plans. We may acquire, sell or close some additional facilities and implement additional cost control programs and other operating efficiencies in the future. We believe that the key ongoing challenges facing us and the health care industry as a whole are (1) providing quality patient care in a competitive and highly regulated environment, (2) obtaining adequate compensation for the services we provide, and (3) managing our costs. The primary cost pressure facing us and the industry is the ongoing increase of labor costs due to a nationwide shortage of nurses. We expect the nursing shortage to continue, and we have implemented various initiatives to improve productivity, to better position our hospitals to attract and retain qualified nursing personnel, and to otherwise manage labor cost pressures. In May 2003, we entered into an agreement with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees with respect to all of our California hospitals and two hospitals in Florida. The agreement is expected to streamline the contract negotiation process if employees choose to organize into collective bargaining units at a facility. The agreement provides a framework for pre negotiated salaries and benefits at these hospitals, and includes a no strike agreement by these organizations at our other facilities for up to three years. We are also experiencing cost pressure as a result of the sharp increase in professional and general liability insurance costs. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS Payments from Medicare constitute a significant portion of our net operating revenues. The Medicare program is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and new governmental funding restrictions all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing services to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations. However, if either the rates paid or scope of services covered by government payors is reduced, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. A final determination of certain amounts earned under the Medicare program often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal, and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that adequate provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for probable adjustments to historical net operating revenues. However, until final settlement, significant issues remain unresolved, and previously determined allowances could be more or less than ultimately required. 33 The major components of our Medicare net patient revenues for the years ended May 31, 2000, 2001, 2002 and the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 approximate the following: Years ended May 31 Seven Months ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 2001 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Diagnosis related group payments $ 1,621 $ 1,648 $ 1,852 $ 991 $ 1,091 Capital cost payments 190 201 244 131 127 Outlier payments 368 570 765 416 495 Outpatient payments 592 485 559 319 344 Disproportionate share payments 240 257 309 168 190 Graduate and Indirect Medical Education payments 125 140 164 88 94 Psychiatric, rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities inpatient payments and other payment categories 334 259 371 202 279 Prior years contractual allowance adjustments 117 9 25 8 Total Medicare net patient revenues $ 3,587 $ 3,569 $ 4,289 $ 2,323 $ 2,620 DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUP PAYMENTS Medicare payments for general hospital inpatient services are based on a prospective payment system that uses diagnosis related groups. Under this system, a hospital receives a fixed amount for each Medicare patient based on the patients assigned diagnosis related group. Although these payments are adjusted for area wage differentials, the adjustments do not take into consideration the hospitals operating costs. Moreover, as discussed below, diagnosis related group payments also exclude the reimbursement of capital costs (such as property taxes, lease expenses, depreciation, and interest related to capital expenditures). The diagnosis related group rates are updated annually, giving consideration to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals. The rate increase that became effective on October 1, 2002 was 2.95 percent. As in prior years, this was below the cost increases for goods and services purchased by our hospitals. We expect that future rate increases will also be below such cost increases. CAPITAL COST PAYMENTS Medicare reimburses general hospitals for their capital costs separately from diagnosis related group payments. In 1992, a prospective payment system covering the reimbursement of inpatient capital costs generally became effective. As of October 1, 2002, after a gradual phase in, all of our hospitals are being reimbursed at a capital cost rate that increases annually by a capital cost market basket update factor. However, as with the diagnosis related group rate increases, we expect that these increases will be below the cost increases of our capital asset purchases. OUTLIER PAYMENTS Outlier payments, which were established by Congress as part of the diagnosis related group prospective payment system, are additional payments made to hospitals for treating patients who are costlier to treat than the average patient. A hospital receives outlier payments when its costs (as determined using gross charges, adjusted by the hospitals cost to charge ratio) exceed a certain threshold established annually by CMS. As mandated by Congress, CMS must limit total outlier payments to between 5 and 6 percent of total 34 diagnosis related group payments. CMS periodically changes the threshold in order to bring expected outlier payments within the mandated limit. An increase to the cost threshold reduces total outlier payments by (1) reducing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments, and (2) reducing the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify. The most recent increase in the threshold became effective on October 1, 2002. CMS currently uses a hospitals most recently settled cost report to set the hospitals cost to charge ratio. Those cost reports are typically two to three years old. Additionally, if a hospitals cost to charge ratio falls below a certain threshold (derived from the cost to charge ratios for all hospitals nationwide), then the cost to charge ratio used to calculate Medicare outlier payments defaults to the statewide average, which is considerably higher. The statewide average is also used when settled cost reports are not available (such as with newly acquired hospitals). On February 28, 2003, CMS announced that it was proposing three changes to its rules governing the calculation of outlier payments: (1) Medicare would be allowed to use more recent data to calculate outlier payments, (2) the use of the statewide average ratio of costs to charges would be eliminated for hospitals with very low computed cost to charge ratios, and (3) Medicare would be allowed to recover overpayments if the actual costs of a hospital stay (which are reflected in the settled cost report) are less than that which was claimed by the provider. We expect these changes to have a material effect on the amount of outlier payments we receive. In anticipation of these changes, on January 6, 2003, we announced to CMS that we had voluntarily adopted a new method for calculating Medicare outlier payments, retroactive to January 1, 2003. With this new method, instead of using recently settled cost reports for our outlier calculations, we are using current year cost to charge ratios. We have also eliminated the use of the statewide average, and we continue to use the current threshold amounts. These two changes have resulted in a drop of Medicare inpatient outlier payments from approximately $65 million per month to approximately $6 million per month. We voluntarily adopted this new method to demonstrate our good faith and to support CMSs likely industrywide solution to the outlier issue. The proposed new rule is not yet final. Our voluntary proposal to CMS included a provision to reconcile the payments we received under our interim arrangement to those we would have received if the CMS rule had gone into effect on January 1, 2003. This could result in our receiving additional outlier payments, or it could result in our refunding some of the outlier payments recorded under the interim arrangement. OUTPATIENT PAYMENTS An outpatient prospective payment system was implemented as of August 1, 2000. This payment system established groups called ambulatory payment classifications for all outpatient procedures. Medicare pays for outpatient services based on the classification. The outpatient prospective payment system provides a transitional period that limits each hospitals losses during the first three and one half years of the program. If a hospitals costs are less than the payment, the hospital keeps the difference. If a hospitals costs are higher than the payment, the hospital is subsidized for part of the loss. The outpatient prospective payment system has not had a material impact on our results of operations. DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE PAYMENTS Certain of our hospitals treat a disproportionately large number of low income patients (i.e., Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive supplemental Social Security income), and, therefore, receive additional payments from the federal government in the form of disproportionate share payments. Congress recently mandated CMS to study the present formula used to calculate these payments. One change being considered would give greater weight to the amount of uncompensated 35 care provided by a hospital than it would to the number of low income patients treated. We cannot predict the impact on our hospitals if CMS revises the formula, however, we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our results of operations. GRADUATE AND INDIRECT MEDICAL EDUCATION Several of our hospitals are currently approved as teaching sites for the training of interns and residents under graduate medical education programs. Our participating hospitals receive additional payments graduate medical education payments for the cost of training residents. In addition, these hospitals receive indirect medical education payments, which are related to the teaching programs. These payments are add ons to the regular diagnosis related group payments. The current indirect medical education payment level is set at 5.5% of total diagnosis related group payments. However, CMS may recommend that the level be reduced to 2.7%. Such a reduction would require Congressional approval. If approved, the change would not become effective until October 1, 2003. Indirect medical education payments received by our hospitals for the three years ended May 31, 2000, 2001, 2002 and the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 were approximately $79 million, $89 million, $110 million, $59 million and $56 million, respectively. If the above reduction is implemented, those payments to our hospitals could be reduced by approximately 50%. PROPOSED CHANGES TO MEDICARE PAYMENTS Under the Medicare law, CMS is required to annually update the prospective payments for acute, rehabilitation, and skilled nursing facilities. The updated payments are effective on October 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. CMS recently issued proposed rules affecting Medicare payments to acute hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals and units, and skilled nursing facilities. These proposed rules are subject to public comment, and we expect the final regulations to be issued on or about August 1, 2003. On May 9, 2003, CMS proposed a rule for inpatient acute care that includes a 3.5 percent increase in payment rates, beginning October 1, 2003. Under the proposed rule, the outlier threshold would increase to $50,645, up from $33,560. CMS anticipates that its proposed rules governing outlier payments described above will be finalized during the comment period for the inpatient prospective payments rule, and changes to the outlier payment methodology adopted in that final rule may make it possible to significantly lower the outlier threshold in the final inpatient rule. In addition, the proposed rules update other payment factors, including the wage index, DRG weights, and other factors that influence the prospective payments. Consequently, the percentage increases described above may not be fully realized in the final payments. We are currently analyzing the impact of all of the proposed changes. MEDICAID Payments we receive under various state Medicaid programs constitute approximately 8% of our net patient revenues. These payments are typically based on fixed rates determined by the individual states. (Only two states in which we operate have a Medicaid outlier payment formula.) We also receive disproportionate share payments under various state Medicaid programs. For the three years ended May 31, 2000, 2001, 2002 and the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, these payments were approximately $160 million, $161 million, $171 million, $91 million and $104 million, respectively. Many of the states in which we operate are experiencing serious budgetary problems and have proposed, or are proposing, new legislation that would significantly reduce the payments they make to 36 hospitals under their Medicaid programs. These pending actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The paragraphs in this section primarily discuss our historical results of operations. However, in light of recent events and our voluntary adoption of a new method for calculating Medicare outlier payments, and the fact that CMS has indicated its intent to change the programs rules regarding Medicare outlier payments, discussed on page 34, we are supplementing certain of the historical information with information presented on an adjusted basis (as if we had received no Medicare outlier revenues during the periods indicated). This adjusted basis information includes numerical measures of our historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that have the effect of depicting such measures of financial performance differently from that presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and are defined under Securities and Exchange Commission rules as "non GAAP financial measures." We believe that the information on this basis is important to our shareholders in order to show more clearly the significant effect that Medicare inpatient outlier revenue has had on elements of our historical results of operations, without necessarily estimating or suggesting their effect on future results of operations. Among the information presented on an adjusted basis are operating expenses expressed as percentages of net operating revenues, net inpatient revenues per patient day and per admission, net cash provided by operating activities, and EBITDA margins (which we define as the ratio of income from continuing operations before interest net of investment earnings, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excluding minority interests, impairment and restructuring charges, loss from early extinguishment of debt and gains or losses from assets sales to net operating revenues). Because costs in our business are largely influenced by volumes and thus generally analyzed as percentages of operating revenues, we provide this additional analytical information to better enable investors to measure expense categories between periods. EBITDA, which is a non GAAP financial measure, is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the healthcare industry. We use EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of assessing hospitals relative performance. EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing such financial performance. Because EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our performance. For the seven months ended December 31, 2002, on a same facility basis, admissions grew 3.5% over the prior year period, net patient revenues were up 11.2% and net inpatient revenue per admission was up 7.2%. On a same facility basis, net patient revenues for the year ended May 31, 2002 improved 13.7%, admissions were up 2.4% and net inpatient revenue per admission improved 12.9% over the prior year. Total company operating margins (the ratio of operating income to net operating revenues) decreased from 12.4% to 12.3%. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $497 million during the year to $2.32 billion. We reported income from continuing operations before income taxes of $590 million in the seven months ended December 31, 2001 and pretax income of $758 million in the seven months ended December 31, 2002. We reported income from continuing operations before income taxes of $618 million in fiscal 2000, $1.09 billion in fiscal 2001, and $1.38 billion in fiscal 2002.

It is a metric used by senior management to measure the effectiveness of our operating strategies in the current operating environment and to allow more direct comparisons of operating performance trends between periods. It is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from it are significant components in understanding and assessing such financial performance. Because it is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, as presented herein it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance. The table below is a reconciliation of operating income to EBITDA and our EBITDA margins for the years ended May 31, 2000 to 2002 and the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. Operating income is a performance measure under GAAP, whereas EBITDA is not. EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of operating performance within the healthcare industry. We use EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of assessing hospitals relative operating performance. EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing such financial performance. Because EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled 38 measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance.

Net operating revenue is a performance measure under GAAP, whereas adjusted net operating revenue is not. EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of operating performance within the healthcare industry.

Although our hospitals expect to receive some level of Medicare outlier revenue in future periods, as discussed earlier, the following two tables show a summary of consolidated results of operations for 41 the years ended May 31, 2000 through 2002 and the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 as if we had received no Medicare outlier revenue during those periods: Years ended May 31 Seven Months ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 2001 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Net operating revenues $ 11,414 $ 12,053 $ 13,913 $ 7,832 $ 8,743 Less Medicare outlier revenue (368 ) (570 ) (765 ) (416 ) (495 ) Adjusted net operating revenues $ 11,046 $ 11,483 $ 13,148 $ 7,416 $ 8,248 Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits 4,508 4,680 5,346 3,012 3,327 Supplies 1,595 1,677 1,960 1,092 1,245 Provision for doubtful accounts 851 849 986 594 676 Other operating expenses 2,525 2,603 2,824 1,602 1,819 Depreciation 411 428 472 273 284 Amortization 122 126 132 78 18 Adjusted operating income before impairment and restructuring charges and loss from early extinguishment of debt 1,034 1,120 1,428 765 879 Impairment and restructuring charges 355 143 99 99 396 Loss from early extinguishment of debt 56 383 281 4 Adjusted operating income 679 921 946 385 479 Add back Medicare outlier revenue 368 570 765 416 495 Operating income $ 1,047 $ 1,491 $ 1,711 $ 801 $ 974 Years ended May 31 Seven Months ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 2001 2002 (% of Net Operating Revenues) Adjusted net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits 40.8 % 40.8 % 40.7 % 40.6 % 40.3 % Supplies 14.4 % 14.6 % 14.9 % 14.7 % 15.1 % Provision for doubtful accounts 7.7 % 7.4 % 7.5 % 8.0 % 8.2 % Other operating expenses 22.9 % 22.7 % 21.5 % 21.6 % 22.1 % Depreciation 3.7 % 3.7 % 3.6 % 3.7 % 3.4 % Amortization 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.0 % 1.1 % 0.2 % Adjusted operating income before impairment and restructuring charges and loss from early extinguishment of debt 9.4 % 9.8 % 10.9 % 10.3 % 10.7 % Impairment and restructuring charges 3.2 % 1.2 % 0.8 % 1.3 % 4.8 % Loss from early extinguishment of debt 0.5 % 2.9 % 3.8 % Adjusted operating income 6.1 % 8.0 % 7.2 % 5.2 % 5.8 % Medicare outlier revenue 3.1 % 4.4 % 5.1 % 5.0 % 5.3 % Operating income 9.2 % 12.4 % 12.3 % 10.2 % 11.1 % 42 The table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our domestic general hospitals: Seven months ended December 31 Years ended May 31 Increase (Decrease) 2000 2001 2002 2001 2002 Number of hospitals (at end of period) 110 111 116 116 114 (2 )(1) Licensed beds (at end of period) 26,939 27,277 28,667 28,748 27,870 (3.1 )% Net inpatient revenues (in millions)(2)(4) $7,029 $7,677 $9,140 $5,086 $5,695 12.0 % Net outpatient revenues (in millions)(2) $3,394 $3,603 $4,108 $2,336 $2,648 13.4 % Admissions 936,142 939,601 1,001,036 566,454 592,503 4.6 % Equivalent admissions(3) 1,351,295 1,341,138 1,429,552 813,601 842,739 3.6 % Average length of stay (days) 5.2 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 (1) Patient days 4,888,649 4,936,753 5,335,919 2,992,929 3,144,560 5.1 % Equivalent patient days(3) 6,975,306 6,956,539 7,516,306 4,240,038 4,411,780 4.1 % Utilization of licensed beds 46.8 % 50.0 % 51.6 % 49.8 % 52.4 % 2.6 %(1) Outpatient visits 9,276,372 9,054,117 9,320,743 5,308,580 5,413,841 2.0 % Net inpatient revenue per patient day(4) $1,438 $1,555 $1,713 $1,699 $1,811 6.6 % Net inpatient revenue per admission(4) $7,508 $8,170 $9,131 $8,979 $9,612 7.0 % (1)The change is the difference between 2001 and 2002 amounts shown.

(4)Although our hospitals expect to receive some level of Medicare outlier revenue in future periods, as discussed earlier, if we had received no Medicare outlier revenue in the periods indicated net inpatient revenues, net inpatient revenue per patient day and net inpatient revenue per admission would have been as follows: Years ended May 31 Seven months ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 2001 2002 Increase (Dollars in Millions) Net inpatient revenues $ 7,029 $ 7,677 $ 9,140 $ 5,086 $ 5,695 12.0 % Less Medicare outlier revenues (368 ) (570 ) (765 ) (416 ) (495 ) 19.0 % Adjusted net inpatient revenues $ 6,661 $ 7,107 $ 8,375 $ 4,670 $ 5,200 11.3 % Adjusted net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 1,363 $ 1,440 $ 1,570 $ 1,560 $ 1,654 6.0 % Adjusted net inpatient revenue per admission $ 7,115 $ 7,564 $ 8,366 $ 8,244 $ 8,776 6.5 % 43  The table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing domestic general hospitals on a same facility basis as of May 31, 2002 for the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002, and as of December 31, 2002 for the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002: Years ended May 31 Seven months ended December 31 2001 2002 2001 2002 Increase Average licensed beds 26,712 26,563 26,787 26,930 0.5 % Patient days 4,891,119 5,075,670 2,914,978 3,039,684 4.3 % Admissions 929,778 952,202 553,783 573,287 3.5 % Outpatient visits 8,963,138 8,857,252 5,188,184 5,244,813 1.1 % Average length of stay (days) 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 Net inpatient revenue per patient day(1) $1,559 $1,737 $1,717 $1,828 6.5 % Net inpatient revenue per admission(1) $8,201 $9,259 $9,040 $9,693 7.2 % (1)If we had received no Medicare outlier payments in the periods indicated, same facility net inpatient revenue per day and net inpatient revenue per admission would have been as follows: Years ended May 31 Seven months ended December 31 2001 2002 2001 2002 Increase Net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 1,559 $ 1,737 $ 1,717 $ 1,828 6.5 % Less Medicare outlier revenue per day (116 ) (145 ) (140 ) (159 ) 13.6 % Adjusted net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 1,443 $ 1,592 $ 1,577 $ 1,669 5.8 % Net inpatient revenue per admission 8,201 9,259 9,040 9,693 7.2 % Less Medicare outlier revenue per admission (609 ) (775 ) (740 ) (842 ) 13.8 % Adjusted net inpatient revenue per admission 7,592 8,484 8,300 8,851 6.6 % The table below shows the sources of net patient revenues for our domestic general hospitals, expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources: Seven months ended December 31 Years ended May 31 Increase (Decrease)(1) 2000 2001 2002 2001 2002 Medicare 32.6 % 30.8 % 31.8 % 30.7 % 30.7 % Medicaid 8.3 % 8.2 % 8.6 % 8.1 % 8.0 % (0.1 )% Managed care 40.7 % 43.3 % 43.9 % 43.8 % 46.2 % 2.4 % Indemnity and other 18.4 % 17.7 % 15.7 % 17.4 % 15.1 % (2.3 )% (1)The change is the difference between the 2001 and 2002 amounts shown. In comparing the seven month period ended December 31, 2002 to the same period of 2001, total facility admissions increased by 4.6%. Total facility admissions for the year ended May 31, 2002 increased by 6.5% compared to 2001. On a total facility basis, net inpatient revenue per admission for the seven months ended December 31, 2002 increased 7.0%, and on a same facility basis, it increased by 7.2% over the prior year period. For the year ended May 31, 2002, on a total facility basis, this statistic increased 11.8% over the prior year and on a same facility basis, it increased by 12.9%. Those percentages reflect lower Medicare outlier revenue, offset by changes in payor classes. As mentioned earlier, our new pricing approach, combined with our voluntary changes to the method we use to calculate Medicare outlier payments, and the anticipated change in Medicare regulations for determining outlier payments, 44 are expected to adversely impact our future revenues. For example, if we had received no Medicare outlier revenue, our net inpatient revenue per admission for the seven month period ended December 31, 2002 would have increased by 6.5% instead of 7.0%. On a same facility basis, the increase would have been 6.6% instead of 7.2% (see table on page 43 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures). Outpatient surgery and outpatient diagnostic procedures continue to increase, while the home health business, which generates lower per visit revenues, continues to decrease. We experienced a 1.1% increase in same facility outpatient visits during the seven month period ended December 31, 2002 compared to the same period a year ago. Net outpatient revenues increased by 13.4% on a total facility basis and by 11.6% on a same facility basis compared to the prior year period. Net outpatient revenues on a total facility basis increased by 6.2% during the years ended May 31, 2001 compared to 2000 and increased 14.0% during 2002 compared to 2001. Net operating revenues from the Companys other operations were $274 million and $257 million in the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, and $748 million in fiscal 2000, $511 million in fiscal 2001 and $425 million in fiscal 2002. The decreases are primarily the result of terminations and contract expirations of unprofitable physician practices and sales of facilities other than general hospitals. Salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 38.5% in the seven month period ended December 31, 2001 and 38.1% in the current period. Without outlier revenue the percentages would have been 40.6% and 40.3%. Salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 39.5% in the year ended May 31, 2000, 38.8% in 2001 and 38.4% in 2002. Without outlier revenue the percentages would have been 40.8%, 40.8% and 40.7%. (See table on page 42 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures.) We have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant wage and benefit pressures created by the current nursing shortage throughout the country and escalating state mandated nurse staffing ratios. Also, we are seeing an increase in labor union activity at our hospitals, particularly in California, in attempts to organize our employees. Approximately 8% of our employees were represented by labor unions as of March 31, 2003. As union activity continues to increase at our hospitals and as additional states enact new laws regarding nurse staffing ratios, our salaries and benefits expense is likely to increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues. In May 2003, we entered into an agreement with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees with respect to all of our California hospitals and two hospitals in Florida. The agreement is expected to streamline the contract negotiation process if employees choose to organize into collective bargaining units at a facility. The agreement provides a framework for pre negotiated salaries and benefits at these hospitals, and includes a no strike agreement by these organizations at our other facilities for up to three years. In March 2003, our board of directors approved a change in accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method, as recommended by SFAS No. 123, effective for the new fiscal year ending December 31, 2003. Based on options granted through March 31, 2003, we estimate that this change will increase salaries and benefits expense by approximately $39 million each quarter throughout the 2003 calendar year. The transition method we have chosen to report this change in accounting is the retroactive restatement method. As such, future presentations of periods with dates ending prior to January 1, 2003 will be restated to reflect the fair value method of accounting, as if the change had been effective throughout those earlier periods. For example, the results of operations for the four quarters prior to the change will be restated to reflect additional salaries and benefits expense ranging between $33 million and $37 million each quarter. 45 Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 13.9% in the seven month period ended December 31, 2001 and 14.2% in the current period. Without outlier revenue the percentages would have been 14.7% and 15.1%. (See table on page 42 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures.). Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 14.0% in the year ended May 31, 2000, 13.9% in 2001 and 14.1% in 2002. Without outlier payments the percentages would have been 14.4%, 14.6% and 14.9%. (See table on page 42 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures.) We control supplies expense through improved utilization and by improving the supply chain process. We also utilize the group purchasing and supplies management services of Broadlane, Inc. Broadlane is a 67.3% owned subsidiary that offers group purchasing procurement strategy, outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry. The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues was 7.6% in the seven month period ended December 31, 2001 and 7.7% in the current period. Without outlier revenue the percentages would have been 8.0% and 8.2%. (See table on page 42 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures.) The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of non program patient revenues (that is, revenues from all sources other than Medicare and Medicaid) was 12.1% in the seven month period ended December 31, 2001 and 12.4% in the current period. The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues was 7.5% in year ended May 31, 2000, 7.0% in 2001 and 7.1% in 2002. Without outlier payments the percentages would have been 7.7%, 7.4% and 7.5%. (See table on page 42 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures.) We continue to focus on initiatives that improve cash flow, which include improving the process for collecting receivables, pursuing timely payments from all payors, and standardizing and improving contract terms, billing systems and the patient registration process. Accounts receivable days outstanding declined from 68.4 days at May 31, 2001 to 59.7 days at May 31, 2002 and increased to 62.8 days at December 31, 2002. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues were 20.5% for the seven month period ended December 31, 2001 and 20.8% for the current period. Without outlier revenue the percentages would have been 21.6% and 22.1%. (See table on page 42 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures.) Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues were 22.1% in year ended May 31, 2000, 21.6% in 2001 and 20.3% in 2002. Without outlier revenue the percentages would have been 22.9%, 22.7% and 21.5%. (See table on page 42 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures.) Included in other operating expenses is malpractice expense of $115 million in the seven month period ended December 31, 2001 and $270 million in the current period. Malpractice expense was $120 million in the year ended May 31, 2000, $144 million in 2001 and $240 million in 2002. We continue to experience unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets and increases in the size of claim settlements and awards in this area. We expect this trend to deteriorate further unless meaningful tort reform legislation is enacted. Our current coverage expires on May 31, 2003, but we anticipate having a new insurance program in place by then. We believe our future coverage will be more costly and may require us to assume more of these risks. The $270 million of malpractice expense for the seven month period ended December 31, 2002 includes charges of (1) approximately $36 million as a result of lowering the discount rate used from 7.5% to 4.61% at December 31, 2002, (2) $29 million due to an increase in reserves at our majority owned insurance subsidiary Hospital Underwriting Group as a result of an increase in the average cost of claims being paid by this subsidiary, and (3) $86 million to increase our self insured retention reserves which are also due to a significant increase in the average cost of claim settlements and awards. The 7.5% rate was based on our average cost of borrowings. The 4.61% rate is based on a risk free, Federal Reserve 10 year maturity composite rate for a period that approximates our estimated claims payout period. 46 In addition, the aggregate amount of claims reported to Hospital Underwriting Group for the year ended May 31, 2001 are approaching the $50 million aggregate policy limit for that year. Once the aggregate limit is exhausted for the policy year, we will bear the first $25 million of loss before any excess insurance coverage would apply. Physicians, including those who practice at some of our hospitals, face similar increases in malpractice insurance premiums and limitations on availability, which could result in lower admissions to our hospitals. Depreciation expense was $273 million in the seven month period ended December 31, 2001 and $284 million in the current period. Depreciation and amortization expense was $533 million in the year ended May 31, 2000, $554 million in 2001 and $604 million in 2002. The increases were primarily due to increased capital expenditures, acquisitions, and the opening of new hospitals in fiscal 2001 and 2002. Goodwill amortization expense was $59 million before taxes in the seven months ended December 31, 2001. As a result of adopting a new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we stopped amortizing goodwill on June 1, 2002. In addition to the cessation of goodwill amortization, the new accounting standards require initial transition tests for goodwill impairment and call for subsequent impairment tests at least annually. In accordance with the new standards, we completed the initial transitional impairment evaluation by November 30, 2002 and as determined by this initial evaluation a transition impairment charge was not required. Because of the change in our fiscal year end and recent changes in our business environment, particularly those related to changes in our method of calculating Medicare outlier payments and proposed changes in government policies regarding Medicare outlier payments, we completed an additional goodwill impairment evaluation as of December 31, 2002 and determined that an impairment charge was not required as of that date either. However, because our reporting units (as defined under SFAS No. 142) will change, due to the consolidation of our operating divisions and regions (announced in March and described on page 3), we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $187 million in March 2003 related to our Central Northeast Region. Our estimates of future cash flows from these assets or asset groups were based on assumptions and projections that we believe to be reasonable and supportable. The fair value estimates of our long lived assets were derived from either independent appraisals, established market values of comparable assets, or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows. In March 2003, we announced a plan to dispose of or consolidate 14 general hospitals that no longer fit our core operating strategy of building and maintaining competitive networks of quality hospitals in major markets. Four of the ten general hospitals for which we recorded impairment charges in the seven months ended December 31, 2002 are part of that plan. We recorded additional impairment charges of approximately $61 million in March 2003 as a loss on the disposals of this asset group, primarily for the write down of long lived assets and goodwill allocated to these disposed businesses to estimated fair values, less costs to sell, at six of the facilities, using the relative fair value method. The carrying values of the remaining facilities are less than their estimated fair values. As previously disclosed, we anticipate selling 11 of the hospitals by the end of the calandar year. We will cease operations at one hospital when the long term lease expires in August 2003. We plan to sell, consolidate or close two other hospitals. We intend to use the proceeds from the divestitures to repurchase common stock and repay indebtedness. These hospitals reported net operating revenues of $953 million for the 12 month period ended December 31, 2002. The income from operations of the asset group was $105 million for the same period. We begin our process of determining if our long lived assets are impaired (other than those related to the elimination of duplicate facilities or excess capacity) by reviewing the historical and projected 47 cash flows of each facility. Facilities whose cash flows are negative and or trending significantly downward on this basis are selected for further impairment analysis. Future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) for these selected facilities are estimated over the expected useful life of the facility, taking into account patient volumes, our analyses of expected changes in growth rates for revenues and expenses, changes in payor mix, changes in certain managed care contract terms and the effect of projected reductions in Medicare outlier payments and other Medicare reimbursement and other payor payment patterns, which assumptions vary by type of facility. Over the past several years these factors have caused significant declines in cash flows at certain facilities such that estimated future cash flows were deemed inadequate to recover the carrying values of the related long lived assets. Continued deterioration of operating results for certain of our physician practices also led to impairment and restructuring charges. Impairment charges have resulted in subsequent minor reductions in depreciation and amortization expense. In addition to striving to continually improve our portfolio of general hospitals through acquisitions, we, at times, divest hospitals that are not essential to our strategic objectives. For the most part, these facilities are not part of an integrated delivery system. The size and performance of these facilities vary, but on average they are smaller, with lower margins. Such divestitures allow us to concentrate on markets in which we already have a strong presence. Over the past several years, our subsidiaries have employed or entered into at risk management agreements with physicians. A significant percentage of these physician practices were acquired as part of large hospital acquisitions or through the formation of integrated health care delivery systems. Many of these physician practices, however, were not profitable. During the latter part of fiscal 1999, we undertook the process of evaluating our physician strategy and began to develop plans to divest, terminate or allow to expire a number of our existing unprofitable physician contracts. During the year ended May 31, 2000, our management, with the authority to do so, authorized the termination, divesture or expiration of the contractual relationships with approximately 50% of our contracted physicians. The termination, divesture or expiration of additional unprofitable physician contracts similarly was authorized in the year ended May 31, 2001. As of May 31, 2002 we had exited most of the unprofitable contracts that management had authorized be terminated or allowed to expire. In December 2002, we recorded impairment charges of $383 million for the write down of long lived assets to their estimated fair values at ten general hospitals, one psychiatric hospital and other properties which represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are independent of other asset group cash flows. We recognized the impairment of these long lived assets because events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the assets or groups of assets might not be fully recoverable from estimated future cash flows. The facts and circumstances leading to that conclusion include: (1) our analyses of expected changes in growth rates for revenues and expenses and changes in payor mix, changes in certain managed care contract terms, and (2) the effect of projected reductions in Medicare outlier payments on net operating revenues and operating cash flows. The $64 million charge for impairment of investment securities in the seven months ended December 31, 2002 relates to our decision in November 2002 to sell our investment of 8,301,067 shares of common stock in Ventas, Inc. We sold the shares on December 20, 2002 for $86 million. Because the fair value of the shares at November 30, 2002 was less than their cost basis and because we did not expect the fair value of the shares to recover prior to the expected time of sale, we recorded the impairment charge in November 2002. During the year ended May 31, 2002 we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of $99 million, primarily relating to the planned closure of two general hospitals and the sales of certain other health care businesses. The impairment and restructuring charges included the write downs of $39 million for property and equipment, $13 million for goodwill and $24 million for other assets. The principal elements of the balance of the charges are $7 million in lease cancellation costs, $5 million in 48 severance costs related to the termination of 691 employees, $2 million in legal costs and settlements and $9 million in other exit costs. We decided to close these hospitals because they were operating at a loss and were not essential to our strategic objectives. During the seven month period ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $13 million primarily for consulting fees and severance and employee relocation costs incurred in connection with changes in our senior executive management team. We expect to incur additional restructuring costs as we move forward with our plans to reduce our operating expenses. Costs remaining in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2002 for impairment and restructuring charges include $43 million primarily for lease cancellations, $9 million in severance and other related costs, $7 million for unfavorable lease commitments and $4 million in estimated costs to buy out unprofitable physician contracts. The $143 million of impairment and restructuring charges recorded in the year ended May 31, 2001 included $98 million related to the completion of our program to divest, terminate or allow to expire the unprofitable physician contracts mentioned above. That was the final charge for this program. Additional charges of $45 million were related to asset impairment write downs for the closure of one hospital and certain other health care businesses. The total charge consists of $55 million in impairment write downs of property, equipment and other assets to estimated fair values and $88 million for expected cash disbursements related to costs of terminating unprofitable physician contracts, severance costs, lease cancellation and other exit costs. The impairment charge consists of $29 million for the write down of property and equipment and $26 million for the write down of other assets. The principal elements of the balance of the charges are $56 million for the buyout of unprofitable physician contracts, $6 million in severance costs related to the termination of 322 employees, $3 million in lease cancellation costs and $23 million in other exit costs. The $355 million of charges recorded in the year ended May 31, 2000 include $177 million relating to the divestiture or termination of unprofitable physician contracts and $178 million relating to the closure or planned sale of five general hospitals and other property and equipment. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $209 million in the seven months ended December 31, 2001 and $147 million in the current period. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $479 million in the year ended May 31, 2000, $456 million in 2001 and $327 million in 2002. The decreases were due to decreases in interest rates and the reduction of debt. From May 31, 2002 to December 31, 2002, we reduced our debt balance by $99 million. During the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002, we refinanced most of our then existing publicly traded debt with new publicly traded debt at lower rates, doubling the average maturity of such debt from five years to more than 10 years. In connection with the refinancing of debt, we recorded extraordinary charges from early extinguishment of debt in the amounts of $56 million in the year ended May 31, 2001 and $383 million in the year ended May 31, 2002 (which includes $281 million in the seven month period ended December 31, 2001). Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in April 2002 and adopted by us as of June 1, 2002, these extraordinary charges have been reclassified in the prior periods presented herein on a pretax basis as part of income from continuing operations. The new standard generally eliminates the previous requirement to report gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items, net of taxes, in the income statement. Investment earnings were earned primarily from notes receivable and investments in debt and equity securities. Fluctuations in minority interests are primarily related to the changes in profitability of certain of these majority owned subsidiaries. 49 The $49 million net gains from sales of facilities and other long term investments in the year ended May 31, 2000 comprises $50 million in gains on sales of 17 general hospitals, three long term care facilities and various other businesses, and $61 million in gains from sales of investments in Internet related health care ventures, offset by $62 million in net losses from sales of other investments. The $28 million net gains in the year ended May 31, 2001 comprise gains from sales of investments in various health care ventures. There were no such gains or losses in fiscal 2002 or the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. Our tax rate before the effect of impairment and restructuring charges and the loss from early extinguishment of debt was 41.2% for the seven months ended December 31, 2001 and 39.0% in the current seven month period. The tax rates for the years ended May 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 were 38.4%, 40.2% and 41.3%, respectively. The decline in the tax rates from the 2001 seven month period to the 2002 seven month period is primarily due to the cessation of non deductible goodwill amortization. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our liquidity for the seven month period ended December 31, 2002 and for the year ended May 31, 2002 was derived primarily from net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sales of new senior notes, and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreements allow us to borrow, repay and reborrow up to $2.0 billion prior to March 1, 2003 and $1.5 billion prior to March 1, 2006. Our 364 day revolving credit agreement for $500 million expired on February 28, 2003. It was undrawn and was not renewed. Net cash provided by operating activities for the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 was $1.1 billion in each period. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended May 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 was $869 million, $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Although our hospitals expect to receive some level of Medicare outlier revenue in future periods, as discussed earlier, if we had received no Medicare outlier revenue during the periods, net cash provided by operating activities would have been $495 million less for the seven months ended December 31, 2002 and $416 million less for the same period a year ago. During the seven months ended December 31, 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit agreements amounted to $1.3 billion. Loan payments under the credit agreements were $1.5 billion. Cash proceeds from the sale of new 5% Senior Notes were $395 million in the seven months ended December 31, 2002. We used the proceeds to redeem at par the $282 million balance of our 6% Exchangeable Subordinated Notes and to retire existing bank loans under the credit agreements. In January 2003, we sold $1 billion of new 73/8% Senior Notes due 2013. We used the proceeds to repay indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreements and for general corporate purposes. These new senior notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness and are redeemable at any time at our option with a redemption premium calculated at the time of redemption. With this transaction and other similar transactions in the past two years, the maturities of $2.6 billion of our long term debt fall between the fiscal years ending December 31, 2011 and 2013. An additional $450 million is not due until 2031. We have no significant long term debt that becomes due until March 1, 2006. We believe that future cash provided by operating activities, the availability of credit under the credit agreement, and, depending on capital market conditions, other borrowings should be adequate to meet known debt service requirements. It should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other presently known operating needs over the next three years. 50 We are currently involved in significant investigations and legal proceedings. (See Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings beginning on page 19 for a description of these matters.) Although we cannot presently determine the timing or the amounts of any potential liabilities resulting from the ultimate resolutions of these investigations and lawsuits, we will incur significant costs in defending them and their outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. During the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002, we expended $556 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, to purchase $514 million and $3.7 billion principal amounts, respectively, of our senior and senior subordinated notes. The expenditures include payments for premiums and transaction costs. During the years ended May 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, we received net proceeds from the sales of facilities, long term investments and other assets of $764 million, $132 million and $28 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were $490 million in the seven months ended December 31, 2002, compared to $472 million in the corresponding period in 2001. Capital expenditures were $619 million in the year ended May 31, 2000, $601 million in 2001 and $889 million in 2002. We expect the level of capital expenditures in the near term future to be somewhat lower. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the development of integrated health care systems in selected geographic areas focusing on core services such as cardiology, orthopedics and neurosurgery, the design and construction of new buildings, expansion and renovation of existing facilities, equipment and systems additions and replacements, introduction of new medical technologies and various other capital improvements. During the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we spent $324 million and $27 million, respectively, for purchases of new businesses, net of cash acquired. During the years ended May 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, we spent $38 million, $29 million and $324 million, respectively, for purchases of new businesses, net of cash acquired. During the year ended May 31, 2002, the Parents board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30 million shares of its common stock to offset the dilutive effect of employee stock option exercises. On July 24, 2002, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 20 million shares of stock, not only to offset the dilutive effect of anticipated employee stock option exercises, but also to enable us to take advantage of opportunistic market conditions. On December 11, 2002, the board of directors authorized the use of net cash flows from operating activities after August 31, 2002, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from asset sales (which includes the anticipated proceeds from the sales of the general hospitals whose planned divestitures we announced in March 2003) to repurchase up to 30 million shares of Parents common stock (which includes 13,763,900 shares that remained under the previous authorizations). During the year ended May 31, 2002 and the seven months ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased a total of 36,263,100 shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average cost of $33.53 per share. Through March 31, 2003, we have repurchased a total of 42,263,100 shares for approximately $1.3 billion at an average cost of $31.36 per share. As of March 31, 2003, we had a cumulative total of $120 million available for future share repurchases, of which amount $98 million was committed to purchase shares under a 10b5 1 plan between April 12 and May 15, 2003. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock. We have not purchased, nor do we intend to purchase, any shares from our directors, officers or employees. At times, we have entered into forward purchase agreements to repurchase common stock owned by unaffiliated counterparties. On October 29, 2002, we settled all of the then outstanding forward purchase agreements and have not entered into any forward purchase agreements since then. Our growth strategy continues to include the prudent development of integrated health care delivery systems, such as acquiring general hospitals and related health care businesses or joining with 51 others to develop integrated health care delivery networks. These endeavors may be financed by net cash provided by operating activities, available credit under the credit agreement, the sale of assets, the sale of additional debt, or other bank borrowings. As of March 31, 2003, the available credit under our credit agreement was $1.39 billion. Our existing credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior and senior subordinated notes contain affirmative, negative and financial covenants which have, among other requirements, limitations on (1) liens, (2) consolidations, merger or the sale of all or substantially all assets unless no default exists and, in the case of a consolidation or merger, the surviving entity assumes all of our obligations under the credit agreements, and (3) subsidiary debt. The covenants also provide that we may declare and pay a dividend and purchase our common stock so long as no default exists and our leverage ratio is less than 3.5 to 1. The leverage ratio is defined in the credit agreement as the ratio of our consolidated total debt to consolidated operating income plus the sum of depreciation, amortization, impairment and other unusual charges. This leverage ratio was 1.34 at December 31, 2002. The credit agreement was amended March 1, 2003 to change our leverage covenant from a maximum ratio of 3.0 to 1 to 2.5 to 1. The amendment also requires us to maintain specified levels of net worth ($3.7 billion at December 31, 2002) and a fixed charge coverage greater than 2.0 to 1. At December 31, 2002, our fixed charge coverage was 6.3 to 1. We are in compliance with all of our loan covenants. Our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts (such as debt and lease agreements) and under contingent commitments (such as debt guarantees and standby letters of credit) are summarized in the table below, as of December 31, 2002: Years ending December 31 Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Later Years (Dollars in Millions Long term debt $ 3,941 $ 43 $ 5 $ 25 $ 1,384 $ 403 $ 2,081 Capital lease obligations 46 4 14 1 1 20 6 Long term operating leases 790 198 131 100 85 78 198 Standby letters of credit and guarantees 169 101 5 3 60 Total $ 4,946 $ 346 $ 155 $ 129 $ 1,530 $ 501 $ 2,285 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use. In general, we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, given particular circumstances. Actual results may vary from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine, and (3) may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions. Our critical accounting policies cover the following areas: recognition of net operating revenues, including contractual allowances accruals for general and professional liability risks impairment of long lived assets and goodwill accounting for income taxes provisions for doubtful accounts 52 REVENUE RECOGNITION We recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed. Net operating revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates (i.e., gross charges), less estimated discounts for contractual allowances (principally for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and managed care and other health plans). The discounts for Medicare and Medicaid contractual allowances are based primarily on prospective payment systems. Discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues, which were more prevalent in earlier periods, are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received. Final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties, which can take several years to resolve completely. Because the laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are ever changing and complex, the estimates recorded by the Company could change by material amounts. We record adjustments to our previously recorded contractual allowances in future periods as final settlements of Medicare and Medicaid cost reports are determined. Adjustments related to final settlements increased revenues in each of the years ended May 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 by $103 million, $4 million and $36 million, respectively, and by $8 million and $5 million in the seven month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. Revenues under managed care health plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues also are subject to review and possible audit by the payors. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements. There are no known material claims, disputes or unsettled matters with any payors that are not adequately provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. ACCRUALS FOR GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY RISKS Through May 31, 2002, we insured substantially all of our professional and comprehensive general liability risks in excess of self insured retentions through a majority owned insurance subsidiary Hospital Underwriting Group under a mature claims made policy with a 10 year discovery period. These self insured retentions were $1 million per occurrence for years ended May 31, 1996 through May 31, 2002, and in prior years varied by hospital and by policy period from $500,000 to $5 million per occurrence. Hospital Underwriting Groups retentions covered the next $2 million per occurrence. Claims in excess of $3 million per occurrence were, in turn, reinsured with major independent insurance companies. Effective June 1, 2002, we formed a new insurance subsidiary. This subsidiary insures these risks under a first year only claims made policy, and, in turn, reinsures its risks in excess of $5 million per occurrence with major independent insurance companies. Subsequent to May 31, 2002, our retention limit is $2 million. Our new subsidiarys retention covers the next $3 million. In addition to the reserves recorded by the above insurance subsidiaries, we maintain reserves based on actuarial estimates by an independent third party for the portion of our professional liability risks, including incurred but not reported claims, for which we do not have insurance coverage. Reserves for losses and related expenses are estimated using expected loss reporting patterns and are discounted to their present value under a risk free rate approach using a Federal Reserve 10 year maturity composite rate that corresponds to our claims payout period. There can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed such estimates. Adjustments to the reserves are included in results of operations in the periods when such amounts are determined. These costs are included in other operating expenses. 53 IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL We evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. Measurement of the amount of the impairment, if any, may be based on independent appraisals, established market values of comparable assets or estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. The estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections believed by management to be reasonable and supportable. They require managements subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates. These assumptions may vary by type of facility. In general, long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell or close. In such circumstances, our estimates of fair value are usually based on independent appraisals, established market prices for comparable assets or internal calculations of estimated future cash flows. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, that we adopted on June 1, 2002, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually. For goodwill, the test is performed at the reporting unit level as defined by SFAS No. 142. If we find the carrying value of goodwill to be impaired, or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value, then we must reduce the carrying value, including any allocated goodwill, to fair value. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of potential tax exposure items requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. While we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS We provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable and our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payor. 54  ITEM 7A. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of December 31, 2002. The fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. We are exposed to interest rate changes on our variable rate long term debt. A 1% change in interest rates on that debt would have resulted in changes in net income of approximately $4 million in the seven month period ended December 31, 2002. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. Maturity Date, Year ending December 31 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed rate long term debt $ 47 $ 19 $ 26 $ 555 $ 423 $ 2,087 $ 3,157 $ 2,812 Average interest rates 9.7 % 10.9 % 8.5 % 5.4 % 5.3 % 6.6 % 6.3 % Variable rate long term debt $ 830 $ 830 $ 830 Average interest rates 2.6 % 2.6 % At December 31, 2002, we had no significant long term, market sensitive investments. Our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as a current asset is substantially mitigated by the frequent turnover of the portfolio. We have no affiliation with partnerships, trusts or other entities (sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities) whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements. Thus, we have no exposure to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risks associated with such entities. 55
