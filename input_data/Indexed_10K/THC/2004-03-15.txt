ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The purpose of this section, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, is to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to better understand the Company, to enhance our overall financial disclosures, to provide the context within which financial information may be analyzed, and to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our earnings and cash flows. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. It includes the following sections: Executive Overview Sources of Revenue Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Critical Accounting Estimates EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND INITIATIVES Fiscal 2003 was a year of transition for Tenet. During 2003, we faced numerous financial and legal challenges, as discussed in more detail within this report. Many of those challenges arose from our prior pricing policies. Changes to those pricing policies, along with changes to the Medicare rules governing the calculation of outlier payments and other factors, have led to declining net operating revenues. In addition, Tenet, like other providers in the health care industry, has experienced significant increases in bad debt expense, largely as a result of increases in the number of uninsured patients and reductions in coverage by some private insurers and state Medicaid programs. At the same time, we have become the subject of heightened and coordinated civil and criminal investigations and legal actions. In 2003, we commenced a series of initiatives and reforms designed to restructure our organization, rebuild our reputation, and improve the performance and quality of our hospitals. These initiatives and reforms included the appointment of new senior management in key positions, changes in corporate governance, streamlining of our operating structure and a new focus on our core hospitals, clinical quality initiatives, cost reductions, and the formation of new labor union alliances. Key initiatives undertaken in 2003 include: Medicare Outlier Revenue Calculations One of the most significant changes that we initiated in the year ended December 31, 2003 was our voluntary adoption, effective January 1, 2003, of a new method for calculating Medicare outlier payments. Effective August 8, 2003, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a new rule governing the calculation of such payments. These significant changes contributed to a drop in total Medicare outlier revenue from approximately $750 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to approximately $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Many of the strategic initiatives that we have adopted are designed to address the financial impact of the loss of revenues resulting from changes to the outlier revenue calculations. Development of a New Senior Management Team In September 2003, following a comprehensive executive search process, the board of directors elected Trevor Fetter as chief executive officer. Mr. Fetter had been appointed president in November 2002 and acting chief executive officer in May 2003. In March 2003, Tenet appointed two top hospital executives, Reynold J. Jennings and 38 W. Randolph Smith, to its senior executive management team, and appointed Stephen Newman, M.D., a seasoned hospital executive, as chief executive officer of Tenets California region. More recently, on February 9, 2004, Tenet announced the appointment of Mr. Jennings as its chief operating officer. In December 2003, Tenet hired E. Peter Urbanowicz as its new general counsel. Prior to joining Tenet, Mr. Urbanowicz was the deputy general counsel of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Since November 2002, nearly 40% of the executives listed in Tenets 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders have retired or resigned, leading to the hiring or promotion of new personnel in key positions. Consolidation of Operating Divisions In March 2003, we consolidated our operating divisions from three to two, with five underlying regions. In February 2004, we appointed a new chief operating officer and announced that we would be further streamlining our organizational structure by eliminating our two divisions and having our five regions, California, Central Northeast, Florida, Southern States and Texas, report directly to the chief operating officer. Divestitures of Facilities During the year ended December 31, 2003, or shortly thereafter, we sold 12 and closed two acute general hospitals. These facilities have been accounted for as discontinued operations. We had determined that these facilities no longer fit our core operating strategy of building competitive networks of quality hospitals in major markets. They had, however, contributed net operating revenues of $1.0 billion and pretax income of approximately $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Total net proceeds, after taxes and transactions costs, from these divestitures, including working capital, will be approximately $663 million. In January 2004, we announced a major restructuring of our operations involving the proposed divestiture of 27 of our acute care hospitals, including 19 in California and eight others in Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri and Texas. We expect to receive total net proceeds from these divestitures of approximately $600 million, a significant portion of which is expected to be received in the form of tax benefits from anticipated losses from the proposed divestitures of many of these hospitals. Additionally, in March 2004, we approved a proposed sale of our general hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The purpose of this restructuring is to enable us to focus our financial and management resources on our remaining 69 domestic general acute care hospitals in 13 states and to create a stronger company with enhanced potential for long term growth. Cost Reduction Initiatives In March 2003, we initiated an operating expense reduction plan consisting of staff and expense reductions above the hospital level, reductions within hospital departments that are not directly involved with patient care, and purchasing power improvements related to our comprehensive nurse agency contracting program. Operating plans at our individual hospitals also include significant levels of cost reduction. Later in 2003, we established additional cost reduction initiatives consisting of improvements in supply chain costs, primarily involving expanded coverage of purchasing contracts with negotiated discounts, increasing compliance with existing contracts, and consolidating purchased services among fewer vendors. We also embarked upon an initiative to consolidate hospital business offices and standardize our information systems to generate recurring annual savings beginning in 2005, with the majority of savings being realized in 2006. This initiative, however, will require significant investment over the next two years. Despite these efforts, we anticipate continuing cost increases in most areas of our operations that may be partially offset by our expense reduction plan. Redding Medical Center Settlements In August 2003, we reached a $54 million settlement with the federal government and the State of California in connection with their investigations of allegations that two physicians performed medically unnecessary invasive cardiac procedures at our Redding Medical Center. In December 2003, we also reached an agreement with the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to resolve our dispute over the OIGs intention, as a result of 39 the above allegations, to exclude Redding Medical Center from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Through this agreement, the OIG agreed to stay further exclusion proceedings, conditioned upon our sale of the hospital. (See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further detail.) Compliance Program In August 2003, we announced the creation of a new compliance department and the appointment of Cheryl Wagonhurst as chief compliance officer. The compliance department is responsible for establishing and meeting industry leading standards in all areas of compliance with government regulation of hospitals. The compliance function was previously handled primarily by the law department, and our general counsel served as chief compliance officer. The chief compliance officer now reports directly to the ethics, quality and compliance committee of our board of directors. Clinical Quality Initiatives In July 2003, Tenet appointed Jennifer Daley, M.D., to the newly created position of senior vice president, clinical quality, and appointed Lauren Arnold, Ph.D., to the newly created position of vice president, nursing. Dr. Daley is responsible for leading Tenets Commitment to Quality initiative, which is focused on (1) improving patient safety and the reporting of medical results, (2) supporting physician excellence, (3) improving the practice and leadership of nursing, and (4) facilitating patient flow and care delivery. Also in 2003, we announced that all eligible Tenet hospitals would participate in a voluntary initiative launched by the American Hospital Association, the Association of Medical Colleges and the Federation of American Hospitals to collect and share with consumers results of the hospitals performance on 10 quality measures for three medical conditions: heart attack, congestive heart failure and pneumonia. Labor Union Alliances During 2003, we announced the creation of alliances with the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees, and the California Nurses Association that include provisions regarding union elections, multi year, predictable wages and benefits, and collaboration and cooperation between management, employees and union representatives. In addition, in December, we announced that a 13 month strike by nurses at Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo, California ended when the hospital entered into an agreement with the California Nurses Association. Implementation of Corporate Governance Changes In 2003, four long serving board members retired from our board of directors and four new directors were appointed. The board then elected a new independent non executive chair, reorganized the audit, compensation, and corporate governance and nominating committees, and approved the declassification of the board, resulting in all board members standing for election annually. New and improved corporate governance measures included the development of stricter director independence standards and the implementation of minimum stock ownership requirements for directors and senior executives. Enhancement of Financial Transparency Effective January 1, 2003, Tenet became the first company in the hospital industry to begin treating stock based compensation as an expense in its financial statements. In addition, in March, we announced a decision to change from a fiscal year ending May 31 to a calendar based fiscal year ending December 31, retroactive to December 31, 2002. This change in year end will allow investors to more easily compare our performance to that of our competitors. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW During the year ended December 31, 2003, we reported net operating revenues of $13.2 billion, compared to $13.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2002, $12.7 billion in the year ended May 31, 2002, and $11.0 billion in the year ended May 31, 2001. We reported a $1.4 billion loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to income from continuing 40 operations of $744 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, $573 million for the year ended May 31, 2002 and $471 million for the year ended May 31, 2001. Patient days and admissions from continuing operations were slightly higher (0.4% and 1.7%, respectively) during the year ended December 31, 2003 than during the year ended December 31, 2002, while net inpatient revenues per patient day or admission were down by 5.1% and 6.3%, respectively. Accordingly, net inpatient revenues were down by 4.7% during the year. The most significant factor contributing to the decline in net inpatient revenues was a $610 million reduction in Medicare outlier revenue during 2003 compared to the year earlier period. Outpatient visits decreased by 0.1% and net outpatient revenues were down by 1.1%. Operating expenses, exclusive of impairment and restructuring charges, were 97.6% of net operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to 85.8% in 2002. Lower net operating revenues, higher salaries and benefits expense, additional provisions for doubtful accounts and costs of litigation and investigations were the principal contributors to this increase. In the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 billion, compared to $316 million in 2002 (see page 61 for further detail). The increased charges were largely the result of declining financial performance at some of our hospitals and a recently completed comprehensive review of the near term and long term prospects of each of our hospitals, including a study of capital expenditures required to comply with Californias seismic regulations for hospitals. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Net cash provided by operating activities dropped from approximately $2.3 billion in each of the years ended May 31, 2002 and December 31, 2002 to $838 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. The principal reasons for the decline were revenue pressures, including reduced Medicare outlier revenue, continued growth in routine costs, particularly labor, malpractice expense and pharmaceuticals, costs of litigation and investigations, increased provision for doubtful accounts, and changes in our business mix as admissions of uninsured patients has grown at an escalating rate. Proceeds from the sales of hospitals and other assets during 2003 aggregated $730 million. The $600 million in estimated proceeds from the anticipated divestiture of 27 domestic hospitals in 2004 and any tax benefit associated with such divestitures should further bolster our liquidity; however, because we expect a significant portion of the proceeds to be received in the form of tax benefits from anticipated losses from the proposed divestitures of many of these hospitals, we do not expect to realize such benefits until 2005. We have no significant debt maturities before late 2006 and we had approximately $600 million in unrestricted cash on hand at December 31, 2003. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our bank credit agreement and our bond indentures (See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Under an agreement recently reached with a required number of our lenders, the total commitments available to us will be reduced from $1.2 billion to $800 million, with a concurrent change to the maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge ratio permitted under the agreement. We have approximately $214 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we have no cash borrowings outstanding. OUTLOOK We have implemented a variety of programs and initiatives to address the various challenges that we presently face. We believe that our decision to divest all but our 69 core hospitals, the consolidation of our divisions and regions, our ongoing program to reduce costs and enhance operating performance, and our clinical quality initiatives will ultimately position us to report significantly improved margin performance. However, we do not anticipate significant operating performance or margin improvement to be achievable in 2004 and, potentially, in 2005, because many challenges will require time to work through. These include ongoing problems resulting from Tenets prior pricing strategy, bad debt 41 expense related to self pay patients, reduced operating cash flow and the need to resolve a number of government investigations and legal actions. The 27 hospitals scheduled for divestiture are expected to generate negative cash flow during the sale process, and the expected long term benefits of our cost saving initiatives will temporarily be offset by restructuring costs. In the long term, however, we believe the prospects for the 69 hospitals that we will continue to operate are positive and the restructuring and initiatives we have undertaken will position us to improve our financial performance. We are also impacted by the challenges facing the health care industry as a whole. We believe that the key ongoing industry wide challenges are as follows: Providing quality patient care in a competitive and highly regulated environment. Obtaining adequate compensation for services provided. Accounts receivable collection. Managing costs. The industry as a whole is challenged by the difficulty of providing quality patient care in a competitive and highly regulated environment. Our establishment of a new compliance department to coordinate our hospitals compliance with the myriad laws and regulations that govern their operations, and our Commitment to Quality initiative, designed to enhance patient outcomes and improve operational effectiveness, should position us competitively to meet these challenges. Pressure from payers also affects our industry. We strive to ensure that we are appropriately compensated for the services we provide, but third party payers continue to ask us to accept lower rates of payment even in the face of rising medical costs. While government regulations determine the amounts we receive for care provided through government programs, we can and will continue to work with managed care payers to ensure adequate and timely reimbursement for our services. We continue to negotiate with managed care payers to reduce reliance on gross charges; however, many payers are unwilling to accept such a change without a reduction in overall net reimbursement to levels significantly below market, which we will not accept. We have disputes with many of our third party payers over payment for past services. Our proposed Compact with Uninsured Patients ("Compact") is designed to offer managed care style discounts to certain uninsured patients, which will enable us to offer lower rates to those patients, who today are charged full gross charges. Currently, a significant portion of those accounts are often written down as provision for doubtful accounts. On February 19, 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human Services issued guidance on discounts for uninsured patients, which will allow us to implement our discount plan. The discounts will be phased in during the second quarter of this year and will be fully in effect by June 30. When implemented the Compact should reduce bad debt expense levels, but it will also reduce net revenues and should have an immaterial effect on net operating performance. We also have seen a recent adverse change in our business mix as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients have grown at an escalating rate. We believe this new trend is due to a combination of broad economic factors, including higher unemployment rates, increased number of patients who are uninsured, and an increased burden of co payments to be made by patients instead of insurers. Additionally, many of these patients are being admitted through the emergency department and often require more costly care, resulting in higher billings. An additional significant cost pressure facing us and the industry is the ongoing increase of labor costs due to a nationwide shortage of nurses. We expect the nursing shortage to continue, and we have implemented various initiatives, such as the Commitment to Quality initiative discussed on page 40, to improve productivity, to better position our hospitals to attract and retain qualified nursing personnel, and to otherwise manage labor cost pressures. 42  SOURCES OF REVENUE We receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources, primarily, the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, managed care payers (also known as health maintenance organizations), indemnity based health insurance companies, and self pay patients (patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement). The table below shows the sources of net patient revenues for our domestic general hospitals, expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources: Years ended May 31 Years ended December 31 2001 2002 Increase (Decrease)(1) 2002 2003 Increase (Decrease)(1) Medicare 30.1 % 31.0 % 0.9 % 30.9 % 26.2 % (4.7 )% Medicaid 8.2 % 8.5 % 0.3 % 8.4 % 9.2 % 0.8 % Managed care(2) 44.4 % 44.9 % 0.5 % 46.3 % 48.9 % 2.6 % Indemnity, Self Pay and other 17.3 % 15.6 % (1.7 )% 14.4 % 15.7 % 1.3 % (1)The change is the difference between the 2002 and 2003 amounts shown. (2)Includes Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS Payments from the government, specifically, the Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), constitute a significant portion of our net operating revenues. These programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing services to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payers are reduced, if we are required to pay substantial amounts in settlement, or if we, or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals, are excluded from participation in the Medicare program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The government is currently investigating our Medicare outlier payments, as discussed under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this report. 43 Medicare Medicare offers different ways for beneficiaries to obtain their medical benefits. One option, the Traditional Medicare Plan is a fee for service payment system. The other option, called Medicare Advantage (formerly, Medicare + Choice), includes managed care and private fee for service plans. The major components of our net patient revenues for services furnished to patients enrolled in the Traditional Medicare Plan for the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002 and the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 approximate the following: Years ended May 31 Years ended December 31 Revenue Descriptions 2001 2002 2002 2003 (Dollars in Millions) Diagnosis related group operating $ 1,459 $ 1,654 $ 1,726 $ 1,827 Diagnosis related group capital 180 221 218 197 Outlier 500 674 750 140 Outpatient 404 481 502 534 Disproportionate share 241 288 305 322 Graduate and Indirect Medical Education 134 159 165 154 Psychiatric, rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities inpatient and other 234 330 434 349 Adjustments for valuation allowance and prior year cost report settlements 3 25 7 (133 ) Total Medicare net patient revenues $ 3,155 $ 3,832 $ 4,107 $ 3,390 Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System Diagnosis Related Group Payments Section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act sets forth a system of payment for the operating costs of acute care hospital stays based on prospectively set rates or a prospective payment system. Section 1886(g) of the Social Security Act requires that capital related costs of hospital inpatient stays also be paid under a prospective payment system. Under these two prospective payment systems, Medicare payment for hospital inpatient operating and capital related costs is made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge. Discharges are classified according to a list of diagnosis related groups ("DRGs"). The base payment amount for operating costs is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share. Both the labor related share of the operating base payments and the capital base payments are adjusted by the geographic variations in labor and capital costs. These base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the DRG assigned to each case. Although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials, the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospitals operating and capital costs. The DRG operating and capital base rates are updated annually, giving consideration to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals. The rate increases that became effective on October 1, 2002 and on October 1, 2003 were 2.95% and 3.40%, respectively. Historically, the annual DRG rate increases have been below the cost increases for goods and services purchased by our hospitals. We expect that future rate increases will also be below such cost increases. Outlier Payments Outlier payments, which were established by Congress as part of the DRG prospective payment system, are additional payments made to hospitals for treating Medicare patients who are costlier to treat than the average patient. 44 A hospital receives outlier payments when its defined costs (gross charges adjusted by the hospitals historical cost to charge ratio) exceed a certain threshold established annually by CMS. As mandated by Congress, CMS must limit total outlier payments to between 5% and 6% of total DRG payments. CMS annually changes the threshold in order to bring expected outlier payments within the mandated limit. A change to the cost threshold affects total outlier payments by changing (1) the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments, and (2) the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify. The most recent change to the cost outlier threshold became effective on October 1, 2003. Prior to October 1, 2003, CMS used a hospitals most recently settled cost reports to set the hospitals outlier cost to charge ratio. Those settled cost reports typically were two to three years old. Additionally, if a hospitals cost to charge ratio fell below a certain threshold (derived from the cost to charge ratios for all hospitals nationwide), then the cost to charge ratio used to calculate Medicare outlier payments defaulted to the statewide average for that hospitals particular state, which was considerably higher. The statewide average was also used when settled cost reports were not available (such as with newly constructed or certain acquired hospitals). During 2003, CMS issued new regulations governing the calculation of outlier payments to hospitals. These regulations, which became effective August 8, 2003, included the following changes: For discharges on or after August 8, 2003 and before October 1, 2003: The ratio of cost to charges would be based on the rules in effect prior to August 8, 2003 unless CMS (through its fiscal intermediaries) determined that an alternative ratio of cost to charges should be used. Newly constructed or certain acquired hospitals for which a settled cost report was not available would continue to be paid on the statewide ratio of cost to charges. There would be no change to the cost outlier threshold. For discharges on or after October 1, 2003: The ratio of cost to charges is based on the latest of either the most recently submitted or the most recently settled cost reports to calculate the cost to charge ratio for outlier payments. The use of the statewide average cost to charge ratio for hospitals with very low cost to charge ratios is discontinued. Medicare fiscal intermediaries have been given specific criteria for identifying hospitals that may have received inappropriately high outlier payments. The intermediaries are authorized to recover overpayments, including interest, if the actual costs of a hospital stay (which are reflected in the settled cost report) were less than those claimed by the provider or if there were indications of abuse. To avoid overpayments or underpayments of outlier cases, hospitals may request changes to their cost to charge ratio (in much the same way that an individual taxpayer can adjust the amount of withholding from income). On January 6, 2003, we voluntarily submitted a proposal to CMS that would reduce outlier payments to our hospitals retroactive to January 1, 2003. Our proposal, issuance of new regulations governing the calculation of outliers, and other factors resulted in a reduction of Medicare outlier revenue recognized by the Company from approximately $750 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to approximately $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our proposal to CMS included a provision to reconcile the payments we would receive under our proposed interim arrangement to those we would have received if the new CMS rules had gone into effect on January 1, 2003 up to the effective date of the final rules and regulations (the "Reconciliation Period"). Effective August 8, 2003, outlier payments to Tenet subsidiary hospitals are being calculated 45 by the fiscal intermediary in accordance with the final rule, which applies to all hospitals. As stipulated by our voluntary outlier payment reduction proposal, we prepared the reduction period reconciliation based on instructions we received from CMS and its fiscal intermediary. Those initial instructions were subsequently revised by CMS, and we submitted an updated reconciliation based on revised instructions. The fiscal intermediary is currently reviewing the updated reconciliation. The final determination and outcome of outlier payments under the arrangement is subject to further review and approval by CMS. Although we earlier expected the fiscal intermediarys and CMSs determination with respect to the reconciliation to be made prior to December 31, 2003, additional clarification regarding the reconciliation has delayed a final determination. Based on the recent clarification, the final outcome could result in an additional material increase to the ultimate amount of outlier revenue we could potentially recognize for the Reconciliation Period. During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded total outlier revenues of approximately $91 million. Included in this amount is approximately $70 million of outlier revenues received in prior quarters and recognized in the fourth quarter as a result of receiving an acknowledgement from CMS confirming the amount due to the Company under the outlier reduction proposal reconciliation that was based on the initial instructions for preparing the reconciliation that we received from CMS and its fiscal intermediary. Disproportionate Share Payments If a Medicare participating hospital serves a disproportionate share of low income patients, it receives a percentage add on to the DRG payment for each case. This percentage varies, depending on several factors that include the percentage of low income patients served. Certain of our hospitals qualify for disproportionate share payments. Congress recently mandated CMS to study the formula used to calculate these payments. One change being considered would give greater weight to the amount of uncompensated care provided by a hospital than it would to the number of low income patients treated, and CMS started collecting uncompensated care data from hospitals in 2003. We cannot predict the impact on our hospitals if CMS revises the disproportionate share payment formula. Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education The Medicare program provides additional compensation for approved teaching hospitals for the additional expenses incurred by such institutions. This additional compensation is made in the form of Direct Graduate Medical Education and Indirect Medical Education payments. Direct Graduate Medical Education Payments are based on an average per resident amount multiplied by the number of residents. Indirect Medical Education Payments are a percentage add on to the DRG payment for each case. The Indirect Medical Education add on payment percentage is based on a formula that is comprised of a fixed percentage (currently, 5.5%) established by Congress, and a hospital specific ratio of residents to beds. Tenet currently operates 35 approved teaching hospitals with a total intern/resident complement of approximately 1,650 full time equivalents, and plans to divest 11 of these hospitals, which have an intern/resident complement of approximately 340 full time equivalents. Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System In accordance with Section 1883(t) of the Social Security Act, CMS implemented a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services effective August 1, 2000, which replaced a cost based reimbursement system. Under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System, hospital outpatient services, except for certain services that are reimbursed on a fee schedule, are classified into groups called Ambulatory Payment Classifications or APCs. Services in each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require, and a payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, hospitals may be paid for more than one APC for an encounter. CMS periodically updates the APCs and annually adjusts rates paid for each APC. The final hospital outpatient rule, which became effective January 1, 2004, provides for the aggregate payments for outpatient services for all hospitals, not just Tenet hospitals, to increase by approximately 4.5%. 46 The outpatient prospective payment system has not had a material impact on our results of operations. Inpatient Rehabilitation Reimbursement Rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units within acute care hospitals are paid according to the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system. In order for a hospital or unit to qualify for inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement, 75% of its patients must be treated for at least one condition requiring rehabilitation as specified in the CMS regulations. Citing inconsistent enforcement of the "75% rule," CMS suspended its enforcement in June 2002. On September 9, 2003, CMS issued a proposal to revise one of the criteria used to categorize a hospital or hospital unit as an inpatient rehabilitation facility. If approved, the new rule would lower the percentage of patients required to fall within the specified medical criteria from 75% to 65%. It would also modify and expand the list of eligible medical conditions. The proposed changes would apply to cost reporting periods starting on or after January 1, 2004, however, CMS has not issued the final rule. We currently operate two inpatient rehabilitation facilities and 28 hospital rehabilitation units as of December 31, 2003. Our previously discussed disposition plan contemplates the divestiture of hospitals that operate eight of these units. Medicare payments for services provided at those hospitals and units represented approximately 6% of Tenets annual Medicare net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. Medicare payments to qualifying inpatient rehabilitation facilities are generally higher than those paid under the Medicare acute hospital prospective payment system for similar services. Failure of our rehabilitation facilities and units to continue to qualify as inpatient rehabilitation facilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cost Reports The final determination of certain Medicare payments to hospitals, such as indirect medical education, direct graduate medical education, disproportionate share, and bad debt expense, are retrospectively determined based on the hospitals cost reports. The final determination of these amounts (sometimes called a reconciliation) often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal, and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. Prior to 2003, the Company recorded estimates for contractual allowances and cost report settlements based on amounts generated from information accumulated from various accounting and information systems. Adjustments to these accruals were generally made upon the final settlement of Medicare and Medicaid cost reports. In 2003, the Company completed the implementation of a new system and methodology for recording Medicare net revenue and estimated cost report settlements. This resulted in a refinement in recording the accruals to more closely reflect the expected final settlements on its cost reports. For filed cost reports, the Company now records the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and records a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the accrual is recorded based on estimates of what the Company expects to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must be filed generally within the five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual may be adjusted accordingly. This change in approach was inseparable from a change in estimate and resulted in a charge of approximately $133 million. This amount is included in the table on page 44 under the line item "Adjustments for valuation allowance and prior year cost report settlements." 47 Medicaid Medicaid programs are funded by both the federal government and state governments. These programs are administered by the states and vary from state to state. Payments we receive under various state Medicaid programs, excluding state funded managed care programs, constituted approximately 9% of our net operating revenues in 2003. These payments are typically based on fixed rates determined by the individual states. (A few states in which we operate have a Medicaid outlier payment formula.) We also receive disproportionate share payments under various state Medicaid programs. For the twelve months ended December 2002 and 2003, the disproportionate share payments were approximately $169 million and $175 million, respectively. On November 3, 2003, the California Department of Health Services issued a press release announcing the results of its audits of Redding Medical Centers Medicaid cost reports. The release alleged that Redding Medical Center had received approximately $12 million in excess reimbursements, $9 million of which had been repaid by the hospital. That $9 million was related to routine reconciliations. The remaining $3 million was related to audit findings, which will be appealed. The news release also stated that the California Department of Health Services intends to expand its audits to all hospitals owned by Tenet subsidiaries in California and refer the audit findings to other state and federal agencies. Many states in which we operate are facing budgetary challenges that pose a threat to Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. We expect these challenges to continue; however, we cannot predict the extent of the impact of the states budget reductions on our hospitals. Also, any changes to federal Medicaid funding methodologies or levels to the states could adversely impact Medicaid payments to our hospitals. Legislative and Regulatory Changes Annual Update to the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System Under Medicare law, CMS is required annually to update certain rules governing prospective payments for acute, rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities. The updates generally become effective October 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year ("FFY"). On August 1, 2003, CMS issued the FFY 2004 hospital inpatient Prospective Payment System final rule. This rule included a 3.4% increase in payment rates for inpatient acute care effective October 1, 2003, and a reduction to the outlier threshold from $33,560 to $31,000. Other payment factors affected by the updated rules include DRG weights, the wage index, and expansion of the DRG transfer rule from 10 diagnosis related groups to 19. While the percentage increase and the lower outlier threshold are somewhat beneficial to Tenet, changes to the outlier payment rules described above and the expansion of the transfer rules offset any benefit. Medicare Occupational Mix Adjustment As explained above, CMS adjusts most hospital prospective payments (including inpatient acute prospective payments, hospital outpatient APC payments, and inpatient rehabilitation facility payments) to account for geographic differences in labor costs through the use of a wage index. Health care industry analysts and others, especially from rural areas, argue that the current wage index calculation, based on cost reports of wages, hours and wage related costs of all hospital employees, does not reflect differences in the mix of occupational categories of employees across hospitals, distorting the wage index for hospitals that employ lower cost employees who perform the work of higher cost, more specialized employees. Furthermore, hospitals with specialized employees treat more acutely ill patient populations, which is reflected in the higher case mix of these hospitals. Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Social Security Act requires CMS to collect data every three years on the occupational mix of employees for each short term acute care hospital participating in the Medicare 48 program in order to construct an occupational mix adjustment to the wage index. The law also requires the application of the occupational mix adjustment to the wage index beginning October 1, 2004. The data collected on the survey will be used to adjust hospitals wage data for the effect of each hospitals special occupational category mix within the general occupational categories. Although we are unable to quantify the effect of the occupational mix adjustment at this time, we believe that it will result in a reduction to our Medicare payments. Inpatient Psychiatric Prospective Payment System On November 19, 2003, CMS proposed a new Medicare per diem prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric facilities to replace the existing cost based payment system. The inpatient psychiatric prospective payment system affects about 2000 inpatient psychiatric facilities, including both freestanding psychiatric hospitals and certified psychiatric units in general acute care hospitals. The proposed base per diem amount will cover nearly all labor and non labor costs of furnishing covered inpatient psychiatric services including routine, ancillary and capital costs. CMS is proposing, among other things, to make additional payments for outlier cases involving beneficiaries with extraordinary care needs to ensure appropriate care for the most ill beneficiaries, and a three year transition period that will be a blend of decreasing cost based payments and increasing prospective payment system payments, with full prospective payment system rates becoming effective in the fourth year. The proposed rule contains an effective date of cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2004; however, CMS has stated that this date will likely be moved back due to the late publication of the proposed rule. We currently operate one freestanding psychiatric hospital and 37 of our hospitals operate Medicare certified psychiatric units. Included in our hospital divestiture plans are 12 hospitals that operate Medicare certified psychiatric units. Because CMS has not issued the final rule, we are unable at this time to estimate the impact on our payments. However, because of the aforementioned delay in the implementation date, and the three year transition period, we do not believe the proposal will significantly impact our 2004 inpatient psychiatric payments. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108 173), which was signed into law on December 18, 2003, includes several provisions affecting hospital Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Below is a summary of the significant provisions affecting our hospitals reimbursement. Medicare. Medicare inpatient prospective payment system payments will maintain an inflationary increase of 3.4% in FFY 2004, a rate equal to the full market basket index. For FFY 2005, 2006 and 2007, hospitals will receive an inpatient update equal to the full market basket rate if they submit quality performance data to the Department of Health and Human Services. Those hospitals not submitting quality performance data for 10 quality measures will receive an increase equal to the market basket rate minus 0.4 percentage points. The update reduction is a one year adjustment and does not affect the base amount inflated from year to year. Hospitals not submitting quality data in FFY 2005 may choose to submit data in 2006 or 2007 and would then receive a full inflationary update. In order to qualify for the full market basket update, hospitals must submit performance data on all patients on the 10 quality measures that are a subset of common hospital performance measures developed and aligned by CMS and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and endorsed by the National Quality Foundation. All of our hospitals currently participate in the National Voluntary Initiative and will, as required by CMS, report the quality data on all 10 measures to receive the full market basket update. 49 The indirect medical education adjustment currently set at 5.5% increases to 6.0% in the last six months of FFY 2004 (April 2004 through September 2004), to 5.8% in FFY 2005, to 5.55% in FFY 2006, and down to 5.35% in FFY 2007. It reverts to current law, 5.5%, for FFY 2008 and beyond. Hospitals meeting certain criteria established by CMS may appeal their Prospective Payment System wage index classification. This one time appeal must be filed between December 8, 2003 and February 15, 2004. Reclassifications would be effective only for discharges on or after April 1, 2004, and in effect for a three year period only. CMS has set aside $900 million for these reclassifications. Certain of our hospitals qualify for an appeal to their wage index classification, and such appeals have been filed where appropriate, however, we cannot predict the success of those appeals. Medicaid. The reduction in Medicaid Disproportionate Share hospital funding (referred to as the "DSH cliff") in fiscal year 2004 is eliminated and the DSH allotment will increase 16% over fiscal year 2003 levels. Subsequent years are frozen at 2004 levels until the allotment level intersects with where it would have been absent relief from the Balanced Budget Act. Increases thereafter are tied to the change in the Consumer Price Index. PRIVATE INSURANCE Managed Care We currently have over 5,000 managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). HMOs generally maintain a full service health care delivery network composed of physician, hospital, pharmacy, and ancillary service providers that HMO members must access through an assigned "primary care" physician. The members care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the HMOs quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner. HMO members or their employers typically pay a fixed, periodic premium for access to the HMO network, so the HMO assumes substantial financial risk for the cost of its members care. HMOs generally seek to shift this financial risk to their network providers in a number of ways. Hospitals generally enter into either capitation or per diem provider services agreements. Under both types of agreements, a hospital is obligated to provide a prescribed range of services to HMO members. Under a capitation agreement, an HMO generally assigns a population of members to a hospital and pays the hospital a fixed amount each month for all the hospital care those members are entitled to receive pursuant to their HMO membership. The capitation agreement therefore shifts significant financial risk to the hospital, since its reimbursement is fixed and the amount of care to be delivered is unknown. Under a per diem agreement the hospital is reimbursed for care delivered to an HMO member pursuant to a discounted fee schedule, and the discount amount is generally expressed as a percentage of the hospitals billed charges. Because an HMO member is billed as services are rendered, these types of agreements generally represent less financial risk to a hospital than capitation agreements. The financial risk is further mitigated by the fact that many per diem agreements contain some form of "stop loss" provision that allows for higher reimbursement rates in difficult medical cases where the hospitals billed charges exceed a certain threshold amount. Managed care contracts represent in excess of $5 billion in anticipated revenues for our 69 core hospitals going forward. Approximately 90% of these contracts have no set expiration date. However, in the last several years, we have renewed or renegotiated approximately 80% of these agreements. National payers generate in excess of 40% of our total managed care revenues. The remainder comes from regional or local payers. 50  The rate methodology used in most of these contracts is a combination of fixed per diems and stop loss dependant charges. We have been working to transition key payers to contracts that use fixed, predictable market based per diems, less dependent on stop loss payments, with market based rate escalators and terms and conditions designed to help us to reduce bad debt expense. In the past, our managed care policy was developed and implemented almost exclusively at the local hospital level. In December 2003, we appointed a new senior vice president of managed care, who will lead a team responsible for developing a strategy to support our hospitals in their managed care relationships and provide a consistent message to payers that will focus on performance management and assessment. Our new approach to managed care will be built around the development of key competencies in the following areas: (1) strategy, policy and initiatives; (2) individualized key payer strategies; (3) managed care economics; (4) regional contracting support for our five hospital regions; and (5) centralized data base management, which will enhance our ability to effectively model contract terms and conditions for negotiations, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of our billing procedures. Indemnity An indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient, subject to an increasing number of policy conditions and exclusions. Unlike an HMO member, a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers. Given this broad consumer discretion, insurers manage their risk in a number of ways. One of the most common is the "preferred provider organization" or "PPO" model. Under a PPO, an insurer will contract with a network of providers who agree to accept certain discounted rates for providing care to PPO members. Sometimes an indemnity insurance company will impose per diem or fixed rates for an episode of care, which may or may not cover the actual cost or charges of such care. The PPO members in turn are entitled to lower provider rates and receive a higher percentage of reimbursement from the insurer if they choose PPO network providers for their care. If a member selects a provider outside of the PPO network, that member will not receive the PPO discount and generally has to shoulder a much higher percentage of the total cost under its agreement with the insurer. The clear incentive is to select "in network" providers, thereby minimizing cost to insurer and patient alike. Tenet hospitals are participating providers in many PPO networks in their market areas and also deliver services to patients covered by more traditional indemnity insurance policies. SELF PAY PATIENTS Self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government payment programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and who do not have some form of private insurance, and are, therefore, responsible for their own medical bills. We have seen an increase in the number of self pay patients. Many of these patients are being admitted through the emergency department and require high acuity treatment, which is more costly to provide and results in above average billings, which are the least collectible of all accounts. We believe these trends are due to a combination of broad economic factors, including higher unemployment rates, increasing numbers of people who are uninsured, and the increasing burden of co payments to be made by patients rather than insurers. Self pay accounts pose significant collectibility problems. The majority of our bad debt expense relates to self pay patients. The Company is taking multiple actions to address the rapid growth in uninsured patients. These initiatives include conducting detailed reviews of intake procedures in hospitals facing the greatest pressures, and enhancing and updating intake best practices for all of our hospitals. We are also developing hospital specific reports detailing collection rates by type of payer to 51 help the hospital management teams better identify areas of vulnerability and opportunities for improvement. Over the longer term, several other initiatives the Company has previously announced should also help address this emerging challenge. For example, the Companys Compact with Uninsured Patients, a plan to offer managed care style discounts to uninsured patients (mentioned earlier herein), will enable the Company to offer lower rates to such patients, who today are charged full gross charges. On February 19, 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human Services issued guidance on discounts for uninsured patients, which will allow us to implement our discount plan. The discounts will be phased in during the second quarter of this year and will be fully in effect by June 30. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following three tables show a summary of our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income or loss, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002 and December 31, 2002 and 2003: Years ended May 31 2001 2002 Change % Change (Dollars in Millions) Net operating revenues: Domestic general hospitals $ 10,508 $ 12,357 $ 1,849 17.6 % Other operations 462 384 (78 ) (16.9 )% Net operating revenues 10,970 12,741 1,771 16.1 % Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits 4,388 5,058 670 15.3 % Supplies 1,519 1,785 266 17.5 % Provision for doubtful accounts 757 893 136 18.0 % Other operating expenses 2,380 2,591 211 8.9 % Depreciation 392 432 40 10.2 % Amortization 120 127 7 5.8 % Impairment and restructuring charges 143 99 (44 ) (30.8 )% Loss from early extinguishment of debt 56 383 327 583.9 % Operating income $ 1,215 $ 1,373 $ 158 13.0 % Years ended December 31 2002 2003 Change % Change (Dollars in Millions) Net operating revenues: Domestic general hospitals $ 13,239 $ 12,792 $ (447 ) (3.4 )% Other operations 365 420 55 15.1 % Net operating revenues 13,604 13,212 (392 ) (2.9 )% Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits 5,366 5,713 347 6.5 % Supplies 1,930 2,085 155 8.0 % Provision for doubtful accounts 969 1,441 472 48.7 % Other operating expenses 2,791 2,912 121 4.3 % Depreciation 442 435 (7 ) (1.6 )% Amortization 69 25 (44 ) (63.8 )% Impairment and restructuring charges 316 1,881 1,565 495.3 % Cost of litigation and investigations 282 282 100.0 % Loss from early extinguishment of debt 105 (105 ) (100.0 )% Operating income (loss) $ 1,616 $ (1,562 ) $ (3,178 ) (196.7 )% 52 Years ended May 31 Years ended December 31 2001 2002 2002 2003 (% of Net Operating Revenues) Net operating revenues: Domestic general hospitals 95.8 % 97.0 % 97.3 % 96.8 % Other operations 4.2 % 3.0 % 2.7 % 3.2 % Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits 40.0 % 39.7 % 39.4 % 43.2 % Supplies 13.9 % 14.0 % 14.2 % 15.8 % Provision for doubtful accounts 6.9 % 7.0 % 7.1 % 10.9 % Other operating expenses 21.7 % 20.3 % 20.5 % 22.0 % Depreciation 3.6 % 3.4 % 3.3 % 3.3 % Amortization 1.1 % 1.0 % 0.5 % 0.2 % Impairment and restructuring charges 1.3 % 0.8 % 2.3 % 14.2 % Costs of litigation and investigations 2.1 % Loss from early extinguishment of debt 0.4 % 3.0 % 0.8 % Operating income (loss) 11.1 % 10.8 % 11.9 % (11.8 )% Net operating revenues of our continuing domestic general acute hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues, as well as nonpatient revenues (primarily rental income and income from services such as cafeteria, gift shops and parking) and other miscellaneous revenue. Net operating revenues of other operations consist primarily of revenues from (1) physician practices, (2) rehabilitation hospitals, long term care facilities, a psychiatric facility and specialty hospitals all of which are located on or near the same campuses as our general hospitals, (3) our hospital in Barcelona, Spain, (4) health care joint ventures operated by us, (5) our subsidiaries offering managed care and indemnity products, and (6) equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. On a same facility basis, net patient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 declined 3.9%, admissions were up 1.9% and net inpatient revenue per admission declined 6.9% over the prior year. Total operating margins (the ratio of operating income (loss) to net operating revenues) decreased from 11.9% to a negative 11.8%. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.5 billion during the year to $838 million. The declines in net patient revenues, operating margins and cash provided by operating activities were primarily caused by reductions in Medicare outlier revenue, increases in operating expenses (particularly additional provisions for doubtful accounts), costs of litigation and investigations, and impairment and restructuring charges, as well as changes in our business mix as admissions of uninsured patients grew at an escalating rate. For the year ended May 31, 2002, net inpatient revenues per admission improved 11.6% on a total facility basis over the prior year. Total operating margins (the ratio of operating income to net operating revenues) decreased from 11.1% to 10.8%. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $497 million during the year to $2.3 billion. During those periods, our financial results were also affected by a variety of other matters as described below. The table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of (1) additional provision for doubtful accounts, (2) goodwill amortization, (3) impairments of long lived assets and goodwill, (4) restructuring charges, (5) costs of litigation and investigations, (6) losses from early extinguishment of debt, (7) net gains on sales of facilities and long term investments, and (8) impairment of investment 53 securities for the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002 and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003: Years ended May 31 Years ended December 31 2001 2002 2002 2003 (Dollars in Millions, except Per Share Amounts) Additional provision for doubtful accounts $ $ $ $ (198 ) Goodwill amortization (95 ) (97 ) (40 ) Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill (55 ) (76 ) (303 ) (1,770 ) Restructuring charges (88 ) (23 ) (13 ) (111 ) Costs of litigation and investigations (282 ) Loss from early extinguishment of debt (56 ) (383 ) (105 ) Net gains on sales of facilities and long term investments 28 16 Impairment of investment securities (64 ) (5 ) Pretax impact $ (266 ) $ (579 ) $ (525 ) $ (2,350 ) After tax impact $ (190 ) $ (389 ) $ (336 ) $ (1,718 ) Diluted per share impact of above items $ (0.39 ) $ (0.77 ) $ (0.67 ) $ (3.68 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share, including above items $ 0.96 $ 1.14 $ 1.49 $ (3.01 ) PRO FORMA INFORMATION In light of recent events and the changes CMS made to the Medicare outlier payment calculations (discussed on page 45), we are supplementing certain historical information with information presented on a pro forma basis as if we had received no Medicare outlier revenues during the periods indicated. This information includes numerical measures of our historical performance, financial position or cash flows that have the effect of depicting such measures of financial performance differently from that presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and that are defined under Securities and Exchange Commission rules as "non GAAP financial measures." We believe that the information presented on this pro forma basis is important to our shareholders in order to show the effect that Medicare outlier revenue had on elements of our historical results of operations and provide important insight into our operations in terms of other underlying business trends, without necessarily estimating or suggesting their effect on future results of operations. This supplemental information has inherent limitations because Medicare outlier revenue in periods prior to January 1, 2003 are not indicative of future periods and such revenue in periods from January 1, 2003 forward may not be indicative of future periods. We compensate for these inherent limitations by also utilizing comparable GAAP measures. In spite of the limitations, we find the supplemental information useful to the extent it better enables us and our investors to evaluate pricing trends and we believe the consistent use of this supplemental information provides us and our investors with reliable period to period comparisons. Costs in our business are largely influenced by volumes and thus are generally analyzed as a percent of net operating revenues, so we provide this additional analytical information to better enable investors to measure expense categories between periods. Based on requests by certain shareholders, we believe that our investors find these non GAAP measures useful as well. Investors are encouraged, however, to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Companys financial performance. Among the information presented herein on a supplemental, or pro forma, basis are operating expenses expressed as percentages of net operating revenues, and net inpatient revenues per patient day and per admission. The two tables below illustrate actual operating expenses as a percent of net operating revenues for the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002 and the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 as if we had received no outlier revenue during the periods indicated. The tables include reconciliations of net 54 operating revenues to net operating revenues adjusted to exclude all outlier revenue. Investors are encouraged, however, to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Companys financial performance.

(5)Although our hospitals expect to receive some level of Medicare outlier revenue in future periods, as discussed earlier, if we had received no Medicare outlier revenue in the periods indicated, domestic general hospital net inpatient revenues, net inpatient revenue per patient day and net inpatient revenue per admission would have been as follows: Years ended December 31 Years ended May 31 Increase (Decrease) 2001 2002 2002 2003 (in millions, except per patient day and per admission amounts) Net inpatient revenues $ 7,026 $ 8,415 $ 8,997 $ 8,571 (4.7 )% Less Medicare outlier revenue (500 ) (674 ) (750 ) (140 ) (81.3 )% Pro forma net inpatient revenues $ 6,526 $ 7,741 $ 8,247 $ 8,431 2.2 % Pro forma net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 1,467 $ 1,597 $ 1,649 $ 1,680 1.9 % Pro forma net inpatient revenue per admission $ 7,743 $ 8,555 $ 8,862 $ 8,906 0.5 % 56 The table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing domestic general hospitals on a same facility basis as of December 31, 2003: Years ended December 31 2002 2003 Increase (Decrease) Average licensed beds 24,591 24,494 (0.4 )% Admissions 923,790 940,934 1.9 % Average length of stay (days) 5.4 5.3 (0.1 ) Patient days 4,944,738 4,986,346 0.8 % Net inpatient revenue per patient day(1) $ 1,810 $ 1,702 (6.0 )% Net inpatient revenue per admission(1) $ 9,688 $ 9,021 (6.9 )% Outpatient visits 8,384,387 8,382,300 (0.0 )% (1)If we had received no Medicare outlier revenue in the periods indicated, same facility net inpatient revenue, net inpatient revenue per day and net inpatient revenue per admission would have been as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2003 Increase (decrease) (in millions, except per patient day and per admission amounts) Net inpatient revenues $ 8,950 $ 8,488 (5.2 )% Less Medicare outlier revenue (748 ) (140 ) (81.3 )% Pro forma net inpatient revenues $ 8,202 $ 8,348 1.8 % Pro forma net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 1,659 $ 1,674 0.9 % Pro forma net inpatient revenue per admission $ 8,879 $ 8,872 (0.1 )% Same facility admissions for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased by 1.9% compared to 2002. On a total facility basis, net inpatient revenue per admission for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased 6.3% over the prior year. On a same facility basis, it decreased 6.9% over the prior year. For the year ended May 31, 2002, on a total facility basis, this statistic increased 11.6% over the prior year. The 2003 percentages reflect lower Medicare outlier revenue partially offset by changes in payer classes. As mentioned earlier, the changes in Medicare regulations for determining outlier payments have adversely impacted our revenues. For example, if we had received no Medicare outlier revenue, our net inpatient revenue per admission for the year ended December 31, 2003 would have increased by 0.5% instead of a decrease of 6.3% on a total facility basis and decreased 0.1% on a same facility basis instead of a decrease of 6.9%. (See tables on page 55 for our explanations of these adjusted performance measures). 57  Same facility outpatient visits for the year ended December 31, 2003 were essentially flat in comparison to the prior year and net outpatient revenue decreased by 1.1% compared to the prior year. Net operating revenues from the Companys other operations were $420 million and $365 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $384 million and $462 million for the years ended May 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily the result of the conversion of a general hospital to a specialty hospital. The decrease for the year ended May 31, 2002 is primarily the result of terminations and contract expirations of unprofitable physician practices and sales of facilities other than general hospitals. SALARIES AND BENEFITS We have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant wage and benefit pressures created by the current nursing shortage throughout the country. Approximately 11% of our employees were represented by labor unions as of December 31, 2003. As union activity continues to increase at our hospitals, our salaries and benefits expense is likely to increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues. In May 2003, we entered into an agreement with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees with respect to all of our California hospitals and two hospitals in Florida. In December 2003, we entered into an agreement with the California Nurses Association with respect to all of our California hospitals. The agreements are expected to streamline the organizing and contract negotiation process, with minimal impact on and disruption to patient care, if a hospitals employees choose to organize into collective bargaining units. The agreements also provide a framework for prenegotiated salaries and benefits at these hospitals. Another factor that will increase our labor costs significantly is the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios. California has enacted such a law and it became effective on January 1, 2004. Not only will state mandated nurse staffing ratios adversely affect our labor costs, if we are unable to hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratios, they also may cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on net operating revenues. In March 2003, our board of directors approved a change in accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method, as recommended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. Based on options granted through December 31, 2003, this change increased salaries and benefits expense by approximately $138 million in the 2003 calendar year. The transition method we chose to report this change in accounting was the retroactive restatement method. As such, presentations of periods with dates ending prior to January 1, 2003 have been restated to reflect the fair value method of accounting, as if the change had been effective throughout those earlier periods. For example, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 reflect additional salaries and benefits expense of approximately $149 million. SUPPLIES We control supplies expense through product standardization, contract compliance, improved utilization, and minimizing waste. We also utilize the group purchasing and supplies management services of Broadlane, Inc., a company that was spun off from Tenet in 1999 and in which we currently hold a 47% interest. Broadlane offers group purchasing procurement strategy, outsourcing, and e commerce services to the health care industry. 58 PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of non program revenues (that is, revenues from all sources other than Medicare and Medicaid) was 16.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002. It was 11.4% for the year ended May 31, 2002 and 10.9% for the year ended May 31, 2001. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts in the year ended December 31 2003 resulted primarily from an additional charge of $198 million to increase the provision for doubtful accounts for continuing operations to reflect a recent adverse change in our business mix as admissions of uninsured patients grew at an escalating rate. We believe these new trends are due to a combination of broad economic factors, including higher unemployment rates, reductions in state Medicaid budgets, increased number of patients who are uninsured, and an increased burden of co payments to be made by patients instead of insurers. Additionally, many of these patients are being admitted through the emergency department and often require more costly care, resulting in higher billings. The additional $198 million charge to increase the provision for doubtful accounts consisted of two components (1) the effect of accelerating the write down of self pay accounts, and (2) the effect of re evaluating the historical collection patterns for self pay and managed care accounts receivable in light of recent trends. Our practice, beginning in the third quarter of 2003, is to write down all self pay accounts receivable, including accounts receivable related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, to their estimated net realizable value on a straight line basis as they age over the course of 120 days, at which time any uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency. In the past, we had employed a methodology that utilized gradual write downs that escalated toward the end of the 120 day period. Given the speed and severity of the new trends in self pay account collection, we changed to a straight line write down methodology in the third quarter of 2003. Historically, our in house collection agency has collected approximately 17 cents of each dollar of self pay accounts assigned to it. Collections on these types of accounts now are being collected at a rate of approximately 12 cents on the dollar. Accordingly, we have changed our accounts receivable evaluation process to give increased weight to the latest 12 months of collection experience. Approximately 20% of the additional charge related to changes in the collectibility of managed care accounts receivables. We continue to experience significant payment pressure from managed care companies (which pressure has been exacerbated by recent disputes with certain managed care companies, primarily in California) concerning substantial amounts of past billings. We are aggressively pursuing collection of these accounts using all means at our disposal, including negotiations, arbitration and litigation, but we may not be successful. Accounts receivable days outstanding from continuing operations increased from 63.6 days at December 31, 2002 to 66.1 days at December 31, 2003. This amount is calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on that date divided by our revenues from continuing operations for the quarter on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter. We continue to focus on initiatives to improve cash flow, which include improving the process for collecting receivables, pursuing timely payments from all payers, and standardizing and improving contract terms, billing systems and the patient registration process. We will continue to review, and adjust as necessary, our methodology for evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, and we may incur additional future charges related to the above described trends. We are taking numerous actions to specifically address the rapid growth in uninsured patients. These initiatives include conducting detailed reviews of intake procedures in hospitals facing these pressures, and introducing intake best practices to all of our subsidiaries hospitals. 59 Over the longer term, several other initiatives we previously announced are also expected to help address this emerging challenge. For example, our Compact with Uninsured Patients, a plan to offer managed care style discounts to certain uninsured patients, would enable us to offer lower rates to such patients, who today are charged full gross charges. Currently, a significant portion of those accounts are often written down as provision for doubtful accounts. On February 19, 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human Services issued guidance on discounts for uninsured patients, which will allow us to implement our discount plan. The discounts will be phased in during the second quarter of this year and will be fully in effect by June 30. In addition, our implementation of our previously announced three year plan to consolidate billing and collection activities in regional business offices is on track and is expected to improve receivables performance once fully executed. The previously announced initiative to standardize patient accounting systems will also allow us to quickly obtain better operations data at a consolidated level, providing management better tools to more quickly diagnose and address business mix shifts. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES Included in other operating expenses is malpractice expense of $322 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $359 million of malpractice expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes charges of (1) approximately $33 million as a result of lowering the discount rate used from 7.5% to 4.61% at December 31, 2002, (2) $27 million due to an increase in reserves at one of our insurance subsidiaries, Hospital Underwriting Group, as a result of an increase in the average cost of claims being paid by this subsidiary, and (3) $80 million to increase our self retention reserves, also due to a significant increase in the average cost of claim settlements and awards. The 7.5% rate was based on our average cost of borrowings. The 4.61% rate was based on a risk free, Federal Reserve 10 year maturity composite rate for a period that approximates our estimated claims payout period. The current year does not include any such material charges. The malpractice expense for the years ended May 31, 2002 and 2001 was $222 million and $133 million, respectively. We continue to experience unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets and increases in the size of claim settlements and awards in this area. We expect this trend to continue unless pricing for insurance becomes favorable, settlement amounts decrease, and meaningful tort reform legislation is enacted. Physicians, including those who practice at some of our hospitals, face similar increases in malpractice insurance premiums and limitations on availability, which could cause those physicians to limit their practice. That, in turn, could result in lower admissions to our hospitals. For the periods June 1, 2000 through May 31, 2001 and June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2002, the policies written by Hospital Underwriting Group provided a maximum of $50 million of its retained losses for each policy period. As of December 31, 2003, Hospital Underwriting Groups retained reserves for losses in each policy period were approaching the policy maximums. If the $50 million maximum amount is exhausted in either of these years, Tenet will be responsible for the first $25 million per occurrence for any subsequent claim paid that was applicable to the policy period before any excess insurance coverage would apply. Effective June 1, 2002, Tenets self insured retention per occurrence was increased to $2 million. In addition, a new wholly owned insurance subsidiary, The Healthcare Insurance Corporation, was formed to insure substantially all of these risks. This subsidiary insures these risks under a claims made policy with retentions per occurrence for the periods June 1, 2002 through May 31, 2003, and June 1, 2003 through May 31, 2004, of $3 million and $13 million, respectively. Risks in excess of these retentions are reinsured with major independent insurance companies. 60 All reinsurance applicable to Hospital Underwriting Group, The Health Care Insurance Corporation, and any excess insurance purchased by Tenet is subject to policy aggregate limitations. If such policy aggregates should be partially or fully exhausted in the future, Tenets financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION The principal reason for the decrease in this expense category during 2003 compared to 2002 was that we stopped amortizing goodwill on June 1, 2002, as a result of adopting a new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill amortization in 2002 was $40 million. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES Our estimates of future cash flows used in impairment analyses for both years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 were based on assumptions and projections that we believe to be reasonable and supportable. Our assumptions took into account revenue and expense growth rates, patient volumes, changes in payer mix, and changes (enacted or anticipated) in legislation and other payer payment patterns. The fair value estimates of our long lived assets and goodwill were derived from either independent appraisals, established market values of comparable assets, or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges consisting of $646 million for impairment of long lived assets (for the write down of long lived assets to their estimated fair values primarily at 28 hospitals), $1.124 billion for impairment of goodwill, primarily related to our California and Central Northeast regions, $70 million in employee severance, benefits and relocation costs, $37 million in non cash stock option modification costs related to terminated employees, and $4 million in contract terminations, consulting and other costs (net of a $13 million reduction in reserves for restructuring charges recorded in prior periods). We recognized the $646 million of impairment charges on long lived assets because our estimates of future cash flows from these assets indicated that the carrying amount of the assets or groups of assets were not fully recoverable from estimated future cash flows. Approximately $187 million of our goodwill impairment charge relates to the consolidation (that we announced on March 10, 2003) of our operating divisions from three to two. Because of this restructuring of our operating divisions and regions, along with a realignment of our executive management team and other factors, our goodwill "reporting units" (as defined under SFAS No. 142) changed. Prior to the restructuring, the reporting units consisted of our three divisions; following the restructuring, they consisted of our five new regions. Because of the change in reporting units, we performed a goodwill impairment evaluation in March 31, 2003 resulting in the above impairment charge related to our Central Northeast region. The $937 million balance of our 2003 goodwill impairment charge is associated primarily with our California and Central Northeast regions as a result of the completion of a comprehensive review of the near term and long term prospects for each of our hospitals. The $111 million in restructuring charges were incurred primarily in connection with (1) our previously announced plans to reduce operating expenses, including the reduction of staff, and (2) the realignment of our executive management team. Costs remaining in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2003 for impairment and restructuring charges include $41 million primarily for lease cancellations, $37 million in severance and other related costs, and $5 million for unfavorable lease commitments. 61 During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded impairment charges for the write down of long lived assets to their estimated fair values at seven general hospitals, one psychiatric hospital and other properties that represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are independent of other asset group cash flows. We recognized the impairment of these long lived assets because events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the assets or groups of assets were not fully recoverable from estimated future cash flows. The facts and circumstances leading to that conclusion include (1) our analyses of expected changes in growth rates for revenues and expenses, changes in payer mix and changes in certain managed care contract terms, and (2) the effect of reduced Medicare outlier revenue on projected net operating revenues and operating cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2002, restructuring charges consisted primarily of consulting fees and severance and employee relocation costs incurred in connection with changes in our senior executive management team. During the year ended May 31, 2002 the impairment and restructuring charges primarily related to the planned closure of two general hospitals and the sales of certain other health care businesses. The total charge consists of (1) impairment write downs of property, equipment, goodwill and other assets to estimated fair value, $76 million, and (2) expected cash disbursements related to lease cancellation costs, severance costs and other exit costs, $23 million. The impairment charge consists of write downs of $39 million for property and equipment, $13 million for goodwill and $24 million for other assets. The balance of the charges consist of $7 million in lease cancellation costs, $5 million in severance costs related to the termination of 691 employees, $2 million in legal costs and settlements, and $9 million in other exit costs. We decided to close the two hospitals because they were operating at a loss and were not essential to our strategic objectives. Subsequently, one of these hospitals was closed and the other was sold. During the year ended May 31, 2001, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges relating to (1) completion of our program to terminate or buy out certain employment and management contracts with approximately 248 physicians, $98 million, and (2) impairment of the carrying values of property and equipment and other assets in connection with the closure of one hospital and certain other health care businesses, $45 million. The total charge consists of $55 million in impairment write downs of property, equipment and other assets to estimated fair values and $88 million for expected cash disbursements related to costs of terminating unprofitable physician contracts, severance costs, lease cancellation and other exit costs. The impairment charge consists of write downs of $29 million for property and equipment and $26 million for other assets. The balance of the charges consist of $56 million for the buyout of unprofitable physician contracts, $6 million in severance costs related to the termination of 322 employees, $3 million in lease cancellation costs, and $23 million in other exit costs. As a result of the unprofitable operation and management of the physician practices, we decided to exit certain physician practices. During the latter part of fiscal 1999, we evaluated our physician strategy and began developing plans to either terminate or allow to expire a significant number of our existing unprofitable contracts. During fiscal 2000, we terminated approximately 50% of our unprofitable physician contracts. The termination of additional physician contracts that were not profitable was similarly authorized in fiscal 2001. As of May 31, 2002, we had exited most of the unprofitable contracts that management had authorized to be terminated or allowed to expire. Substantially all such remaining contracts were terminated by July 31, 2002. The physicians, employees and property owners/lessors affected by this decision were duly notified, prior to our respective fiscal year ends. 62 COSTS OF LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS Costs of litigation and investigations for the year ended December 31, 2003 consist primarily of: (1)A $152 million charge recorded for an award of contract damages by a California appellate court to a former executive in connection with our alleged failure to provide certain incentive stock awards to the executive. This charge includes post judgment interest through December 31, 2003 and attorneys fees and costs. On February 18, 2004, the California Supreme Court declined to review the appellate courts decision. Tenet paid $163.3 million to the former executive on March 1, 2004 in satisfaction of the final judgment. (2)$54 million that has been paid for the settlement of the Redding Medical Center matter as discussed above. (3)An aggregate of $30.2 million, which has been accrued, but remains unpaid as of December 31, 2003, for the proposed settlement of the United States Ex Rel. Barbera v. Amisub (North Ridge Hospital), Inc. lawsuit described on page 20 and the proposed settlement of the transfer discharge investigation also described on page 20. The remaining costs were for other miscellaneous settlements and costs to defend the Company. LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT In connection with the refinancing of debt, we recorded extraordinary charges from early extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2002, in the year ended May 31, 2002 and in the year ended May 31, 2001. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in April 2002 and adopted by us as of June 1, 2002, these extraordinary charges have been reclassified in the prior periods presented herein on a pretax basis as part of income from continuing operations. The new standard generally eliminates the previous requirement to report gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. INTEREST EXPENSE The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 2003 compared to the year ended December 2002 was largely attributable to the refinancing of our variable rate uninsured loans payable to banks under our credit agreement with the new 73/8% senior notes due 2013. The decrease in the year ended May 2002 compared to May 2001 was due to a decrease in interest rates and the reduction of debt. From May 2000 to December 31, 2003, we reduced our debt balance by $1.6 billion. During the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002, we refinanced most of our then existing publicly traded debt with new publicly traded debt at lower rates, doubling the average maturity of such debt from five years to more than 10 years. INVESTMENT EARNINGS AND MINORITY INTEREST Investment earnings were earned primarily from notes receivable and investments in debt and equity securities. Fluctuations in minority interests are primarily related to the changes in profitability of certain majority owned subsidiaries. NET GAINS ON SALES OF FACILITIES AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS The $16 million net gains in the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily comprise gains related to (1) our sale of a portion of our common stock in Broadlane, Inc. and (2) collection of certain notes receivable associated with hospitals sold in prior years that had been previously reserved for in earlier 63 periods. The $28 million net gains in the year ended May 31, 2001 comprise gains from sales of investments in various health care ventures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH REQUIREMENTS Our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts such as debt and lease agreements and under contingent commitments such as debt guarantees and standby letters of credit are summarized in the table below, all as of December 31, 2003: Years ending December 31 Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Later Years (Dollars in Millions) Long term debt $ 4,101 $ 4 $ 40 $ 555 $ 410 $ 7 $ 3,085 Capital lease obligations 45 14 2 2 20 1 6 Long term operating leases 865 180 153 139 131 100 162 Standby letters of credit and guarantees 251 221 7 7 4 3 9 Total $ 5,262 $ 419 $ 202 $ 703 $ 565 $ 111 $ 3,262 The letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security for certain portions under a selected number of programs to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under our professional and general liability insurance programs. The amount of collateral required is principally dependent upon the level of claims activity and the credit worthiness of the Company. The insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible and or self insured retention layers. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the design and construction of new buildings, expansion and renovation of existing facilities, including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations, equipment and systems additions and replacements, introduction of new medical technologies, construction of new hospitals and various other capital improvements. Capital expenditures were $833 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, including $80 million related to the construction of two new hospitals, compared to $907 million in the corresponding period in 2002, which included $20 million related to the construction of two new hospitals. Capital expenditures were $889 million in the year ended May 31, 2002 and $601 million in the year ended May 31, 2001. We estimate our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2004 to be between $500 million and $550 million for our 69 core hospitals, including approximately $70 million for our systems standardization and business office consolidation projects. In addition, we will spend approximately $80 million to complete construction of two new hospitals in Texas and Tennessee. For the year ending December 31, 2005, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to $500 million. These capital expenditures include approximately $4 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2005 of the estimated $300 million required to meet the California seismic requirements by 2012 for the remaining California facilities after all planned divestitures. We are currently involved in significant investigations and legal proceedings. (See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, beginning on page 18 for a description of these matters.) Although we cannot presently determine the timing or the amounts of any potential liabilities resulting from the ultimate resolutions of these investigations and lawsuits, we will incur significant costs in defending them and their outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. 64  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2003 was derived primarily from proceeds from the sales of new senior notes, sales of facilities and net cash provided by operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2002, as well as the years ended May 31, 2002 and 2001, our liquidity was derived primarily from net cash provided by operating activities, the sales of new senior notes, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit agreement, and from proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $838 million, down significantly from approximately $2.3 billion in each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and May 31, 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended May 31, 2001 was $1.8 billion. The principal reasons for the decline in 2003 were reduced Medicare outlier revenue, reduced reimbursements for managed care, higher operating costs and costs of litigation and investigations, and changes in our business mix as admissions of uninsured patients grew at an escalating rate. Cash proceeds from the sale of new senior notes were $979 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 and $981 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. We used the proceeds to redeem other long term debt, to retire existing bank loans under the credit agreements and for general corporate purposes. With these note sales and other similar transactions in the past three years, the maturities of $2.6 billion of our long term debt fall between the years ending December 31, 2011 and 2013. An additional $450 million is not due until 2031. We have no significant long term debt that becomes due until November 2006. Proceeds from the sales of hospitals and other assets during 2003 aggregated $730 million. Approximately $88 million of these proceeds were invested in an escrow account dedicated to funding costs associated with completing construction at certain of the Companys hospitals. The estimated proceeds from forecasted hospital sales in 2004 and any tax benefit associated with such sales should further bolster our liquidity, although we do not expect to realize in cash a significant portion of the potential proceeds anticipated from such tax benefits until mid 2005. Between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2003, we purchased 48,734,599 shares of our common stock for $1.4 billion, of which $208 million was spent in the year ended December 31, 2003. The repurchases were authorized by our board of directors and are held as treasury stock. We have not made any repurchases since June 30, 2003 and do not intend to repurchase any more shares in 2004. DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND RELATED COVENANTS We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our bank credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes. (See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 89.) Under the terms of an agreement recently reached with a required number of our lenders, the total commitments available to us will be reduced from $1.2 billion to $800 million, but the maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge ratio permitted under the agreement will be changed from no higher than 3.5 to 1 to 5.5 to 1 prior to June 30, 2005 and 5.0 to 1 thereafter for the leverage ratio and no less than 1.5 to 1 for the fixed charge ratio. Cash borrowings will be limited to $500 million under the agreement, but undrawn availability may be used to issue letters of credit up to the $800 million limit. The amended credit agreement will require us to pledge the capital stock of our hospital operating subsidiaries to secure our obligations under the agreement. The subsidiaries will guarantee our obligations. We currently have approximately $214 million of letters of credit outstanding under the bank credit agreement, but no cash borrowings are currently outstanding. We had approximately $600 million in unrestricted cash on hand at December 31, 2003. 65 The bank credit agreement includes a covenant that restricts our ability to repurchase non credit agreement debt in excess of $50 million if our leverage ratio is greater than 2.50 to 1, unless the credit facility is undrawn and we would have a minimum of $100 million of unrestricted cash on hand following the repurchase of the debt. LIQUIDITY We believe that existing unrestricted cash on hand, future cash provided by operating activities, the sales of facilities, the availability of credit under the credit agreement, and, depending on capital market conditions, other borrowings should be adequate to meet known debt service requirements. It should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other presently known operating needs over the next three years. However, our cash needs could be materially affected by the various uncertainties discussed in this section and the impact of potential judgments and settlements addressed in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, as well as changes in our results of operations. We are aggressively identifying and implementing further actions to reduce costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. Among the areas being addressed are commercial payer contracting, improved procurement efficiencies, cost standardization, bad debt expense reduction initiatives and trimming certain non patient care hospital costs. We believe our restructuring plan and the various initiatives we have undertaken will ultimately position us to report improved operating and margin performance, although that margin performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other potential differences in hospital portfolios. We believe it is important for a reader to understand that (1) if our results of operations continue to deteriorate, and or (2) if claims, lawsuits, settlements or investigations are resolved in a materially adverse manner, there could be substantial doubt about the Companys liquidity. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors, except for $251 million of standby letters of credit and guarantees as of December 31, 2003 (shown in the table on page 64). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use. In general, we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, given the particular circumstances in which the Company operates. Actual results may vary from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine, and (3) may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas: Recognition of net operating revenues, including contractual allowances. Provisions for doubtful accounts. Accruals for general and professional liability risks. 66 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill. Accounting for exit plans. Accounting for income taxes. Accounting for stock based compensation. REVENUE RECOGNITION We recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed. Net operating revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates (i.e., gross charges), less estimated discounts for contractual allowances (principally for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and managed care and other health plans). Revenues under the traditional fee for service Medicare and Medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems. Discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues, which were more prevalent in earlier periods, and certain other payments, which are based on the hospitals cost reports, are estimated using historical trends and current factors. Cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by Medicare and Medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review, which can take several years until final settlement of such matters are determined and completely resolved. Because the laws, regulations, instructions, and the interpretation of the rules governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently, the estimates recorded by the Company could change by material amounts. Adjustments related to cost report settlements increased revenues in each of the years ended May 31, 2001 and 2002 by $3 million and $25 million, respectively, and by $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. Prior to 2003, the Company recorded estimates for contractual allowances and cost report settlements based on amounts generated from information accumulated from various accounting and information systems. Adjustments to these accruals were generally made upon the final settlement of Medicare and Medicaid cost reports. In 2003, the Company completed the implementation of a new system and methodology for recording Medicare net revenue and estimated cost report settlements. This resulted in a refinement in recording the accruals to more closely reflect the expected final settlements on its cost reports. For filed cost reports, the Company now records the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and records a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the accrual is recorded based on estimates of what the Company expects to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must be filed generally within the five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual may be adjusted accordingly. This change in approach was inseparable from a change in estimate and resulted in a charge of approximately $133 million. This amount is included in the table on page 44 under the line item "Adjustments for valuation allowance and prior year cost report settlements." Revenues under managed care health plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues also are subject to review and possible audit by the payers. We believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements. We know of no known material claims, disputes or unsettled matters with any payers for which we have not adequately provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 67 PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS We provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable, our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer, and other relevant factors. Our practice is to write down self pay accounts receivable, including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, to their estimated net realizable value as they age over the course of 120 days, at which time any uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency. Prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2003, we had employed a methodology that utilized graduated write downs that escalated toward the end of the period. Because of the speed and severity of new, adverse trends in self pay account collection, we changed to a straight line write down methodology beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2003. These changes resulted in an additional charge of approximately $198 million to increase the provision for doubtful accounts during the quarter ended September 30, 2003. Collections on self pay accounts assigned to our in house collection agency have recently deteriorated from a historical pattern of approximately 17 cents on the dollar to a pattern of approximately 12 cents on the dollar. As a result, we have changed our accounts receivable evaluation process in the third quarter of 2003 to give more weight to the latest 12 months of collection experience. ACCRUALS FOR GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY RISKS We insure substantially all of our professional and comprehensive general liability risks in excess of self insured retentions through insurance subsidiaries. (See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 99.) Risks in excess of these retentions are reinsured with major independent insurance companies. Tenet records reserves for claims when they are probable and reasonably estimable. We maintain reserves, which are based on actuarial estimates by an independent third party, for the portion of our professional liability risks, including incurred but not reported claims, to the extent we do not have insurance coverage (i.e., self insured retentions). We estimate reserves for losses and related expenses using expected loss reporting patterns. Reserves are discounted to their estimated present value under a risk free rate approach using a Federal Reserve 10 year maturity composite rate that approximates our claims payout period. There can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates. Adjustments to the estimated reserves are recorded in our results of operations in the periods when such amounts are determined. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL We evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. However, there is an evaluation performed at least annually. We base the measurement of the amount of the impairment, if any, on independent appraisals, established market values of comparable assets or estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. The estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable. They require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates. These assumptions may vary by type of facility. We report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell or close. In such circumstances, our estimates of fair value are based on independent 68 appraisals, established market prices for comparable assets or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually. For goodwill, we perform the test at the reporting unit level, as defined by appropriate accounting standards, when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually. If we find the carrying value of goodwill to be impaired, or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value, then we reduce the carrying value, including any allocated goodwill, to fair value. Estimates of fair value are based on independent appraisals, established market prices for comparative assets or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows. Our analyses resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $1.124 billion in the year ended December 31, 2003. There was no goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2002. Our remaining goodwill at December 31, 2003 was $1.949 billion. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of potential tax exposure items requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. While we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method recommended by SFAS No. 123 under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees, directors, advisors and consultants generally is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant date and is recognized over the vesting periods of the awards, whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant, using a Black Scholes option pricing model. This model incorporates our reasoned assumptions regarding (1) the expected volatility of our common stock price, (2) estimated risk free interest rates, and (3) the expected dividend yield, if any, all over the expected lives of the respective options. We do not adjust the model for non transferability, risk of forfeiture or the vesting restrictions of the option all of which would reduce the option value if factored into our calculations. The most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option, because it, in turn, is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates. Accordingly, we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date. Our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns and is reviewed from time to time by an outside, independent consulting firm. 69  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of December 31, 2003. The fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. At December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings under our five year revolving credit agreement. If we do borrow under that agreement, we will be exposed to variable interest rate changes. Maturity Date, Year ending December 31 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Fair Value (Dollars in Millions) Fixed rate long term debt $ 18 $ 42 $ 557 $ 430 $ 8 $ 3,091 $ 4,146 $ 4,034 Average interest rates 6.6 % 7.6 % 5.7 % 5.5 % 7.3 % 6.8 % 6.5 % We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. At December 31, 2003, we had no significant long term, market sensitive investments. Our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as a current asset is substantially mitigated by the frequent turnover of the portfolio. We have no affiliation with partnerships, trusts or other entities (sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities) whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements. Thus, we have no exposure to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risks associated with such entities. 70
