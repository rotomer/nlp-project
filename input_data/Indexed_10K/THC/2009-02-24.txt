ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The purpose of this section, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, is to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to better understand our business, to enhance our overall financial disclosures, to provide the context within which our financial information may be analyzed, and to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial and statistical information included herein relates to our continuing operations, with dollar amounts expressed in millions (except per share, per admission, per patient day and per visit amounts). This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. It includes the following sections: Executive Overview Sources of Revenue Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Recently Issued Accounting Standards Critical Accounting Estimates EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We continue to focus on the execution of our operating strategies. While we have seen certain areas of improvement, we are still facing several industry challenges that continue to negatively affect our progress. We are dedicated to improving our patients, shareholders and other stakeholders confidence in us. We believe we will accomplish that by providing quality care and generating positive volume growth and earnings at our hospitals. KEY DEVELOPMENTS Recent key developments include the following: Definitive Agreement to Sell USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital On February 10, 2009, we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement with the University of Southern California for the sale of USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital. An ongoing dispute between us and the University will be resolved upon consummation of the transaction, which is targeted for completion by March 31, 2009 and is subject to conditions and regulatory approvals that must be satisfied prior to closing. We recorded an impairment charge of approximately $40 million, pre tax and after tax, in discontinued operations in the three months ended December 31, 2008 related to the sale. 27 Table of Contents Exchange Offer In early 2009, we made an offer to exchange up to $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes maturing in December 2011 and June 2012 for an equal aggregate principal amount of two new series of senior secured notes maturing in 2015 and 2018 in a private placement. As of the filing date of this report, the offer remained open. Any new notes ultimately issued as part of the exchange offer will be guaranteed by and secured by a pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our subsidiaries. New Agreement with Blue Shield of California In January 2009, we entered into a new, multi year agreement with Blue Shield of California. Under the agreement, members of Blue Shield of Californias managed care plans will retain access to 12 of our acute care hospitals, our cancer hospital and three of our freestanding ambulatory surgery centers for their in network health care services. In addition, nine of the acute care hospitals and our cancer hospital are in Blue Shield of Californias Medicare Advantage network. Closures of Community Hospital of Los Gatos and Irvine Regional Hospital and Medical Center On January 15, 2009, we closed Irvine Regional Hospital and Medical Center, including its emergency room, as announced in October 2008. Also in January 2009, we announced plans to close Community Hospital of Los Gatos, including its emergency room, on April 10, 2009. We had previously announced our intention to allow the leases for both hospitals to expire in February 2009 and May 2009, respectively; however, the lessor subsequently requested we return the Irvine property as a closed hospital and advised us that the Los Gatos property was not required to be operational at the expiration of our lease. Formation of Conifer Health Solutions In November 2008, we announced the formation of a wholly owned operating subsidiary, Conifer Health Solutions, Inc., offering a full range of revenue cycle management and patient communication services. The new company has more than 100 hospitals, including those operated by us, under contract. Outsourcing of Materials Management and Procurement Functions In October 2008, we announced we had signed a seven year agreement to outsource our materials management and procurement functions to Broadlane, Inc., a former affiliate and provider of hospital supply chain services. Divestiture of Tarzana Hospital In September 2008, we completed the previously disclosed divestiture of the Tarzana campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center in California. Our interest in a joint venture was also sold in connection with that divestiture as part of our previously disclosed settlement of a lease dispute. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Quality Awards In September 2008, we announced that CIGNA HealthCare, a subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation, awarded 38 of our hospitals with 214 quality designations. In addition, 21 Tenet hospitals received 60 Center of Excellence designations for 2008 from CIGNA HealthCare. Sale of Interest in Broadlane In August 2008, we completed the previously disclosed sale of our entire interest in Broadlane, Inc. Our estimated sales proceeds are $159 million. Approximately ten percent of the proceeds are being held in escrow to be distributed to us over approximately six years. Decision to Relocate Our Corporate Headquarters to Downtown Dallas In August 2008, we announced that we will move our corporate headquarters from north Dallas, Texas to downtown Dallas. The move is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2009. Settlement of Lease Disputes In July 2008, we announced we had reached a settlement with HCP, Inc., a real estate investment trust that owned seven hospitals leased by our subsidiaries, to resolve pending litigation and arbitration proceedings relating to the lease agreements for those hospitals. As part of the settlement, we acquired the Tarzana campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center from HCP and simultaneously sold it to a third party in September 2008. We also continued or extended our HCP leases for Frye Regional Medical Center, North Fulton Regional Hospital, NorthShore Regional Medical Center and Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, and provided notice of non renewal of the leases for Community Hospital of Los Gatos and Irvine Regional Hospital and Medical Center. New General Counsel and Secretary In July 2008, Gary Ruff, our vice president and assistant general counsel for hospital operations, was appointed senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary. Mr. Ruff replaced E. Peter Urbanowicz, our former general counsel and corporate secretary, who left the company in March 2008 to pursue other opportunities. 28 Table of Contents Amendment of Credit Agreement In June 2008, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that allows us to grant liens on certain hospital facilities and inventory up to certain dollar limits set forth in the amendment. The amendment also provides us with additional flexibility over the remaining term of the credit agreement to pursue, at our option, various alternatives to refinance our existing unsecured senior debt, if market conditions and other considerations warrant. The alternatives include the issuance of secured debt, preferred stock and convertible debt, as well as other unsecured debt. New Managed Care Agreements In June 2008, we entered into a multi year agreement with MultiPlan, Inc., which includes participation in both the MultiPlan and PHCS (formerly Private Healthcare Systems) networks. The agreement includes all of our hospitals, outpatient facilities and ambulatory care centers effective July 1, 2008. In July 2008, we entered into a three year agreement with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, which includes all of that payers commercial and Medicare products and covers our 10 acute care hospitals in Florida. Also in July 2008, we announced we had reached a new contract with WellPoint, Inc.s affiliated health plans in California, Missouri and Georgia, as well as its affiliated UniCare health plan in Texas. The agreement expands our existing pay for performance provisions and adds seven more of our hospitals to WellPoints affiliated health plans networks. Sale of Three California Hospitals In June 2008, we sold the Encino campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center. Also in June, we completed the sale of two other acute care hospitals Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center and San Dimas Community Hospital for pretax proceeds of approximately $41 million. Opening of New Hospital In May 2008, we opened our newly constructed Sierra Providence East Medical Center, a 110 bed acute care facility located in El Paso, Texas. Beech Street and ppoNEXT Agreements Signed In April 2008, we signed multi year agreements to include all of our hospitals, outpatient and ambulatory centers, and employed physicians in the Beech Street and ppoNEXT managed care networks. Sale of North Ridge Medical Center On March 31, 2008, we completed the sale of North Ridge Medical Center in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida for pretax proceeds of approximately $21 million. Union Organizing Activities In 2008, the California Nurses Association and the Service Employees International Union commenced union organizing activities at several of our hospitals as contemplated by the terms of the peace accords we entered into with both unions in 2007, as described in Part I of this report under the caption Business Medical Staff and Employees. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES As stated above, there are significant industry wide challenges that have been impacting our operating performance. Below is a summary of these items. Volumes Although we have seen some improvements in recent quarters, we have experienced declines in patient volumes over the last several years. We believe the reasons for these declines include, but are not limited to, factors that have affected many hospital companies, including decreases in the demand for invasive cardiac procedures, increased competition and managed care contract negotiations or terminations. Given our geographic concentration, we are also affected by population trends, which have been a particular concern in Florida. In addition, we believe the industry wide challenges associated with physician recruitment, retention and attrition have also been significant contributors to our past volume declines. Our operations depend on the efforts, abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, most of whom have no contractual relationship with us. It is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs. Although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs during 2007 and 2008, in some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance. Other issues facing physicians, such as proposed decreases in Medicare payments, are forcing them to consider alternatives, including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected. In some of our markets, we have not been able to attract physicians to our medical staffs at a rate to offset the physicians relocating or retiring. 29 Table of Contents We continue to take steps to increase patient volumes; however, due to the concentration of our hospitals in California, Florida and Texas, we may not be able to mitigate some factors that contribute to volume declines. One of our initiatives is our Physician Relationship Program, which is centered around understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations. We have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals, which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes. We have also sought to include all of our hospitals in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts, which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks. In addition, we have been completing clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results. This Targeted Growth Initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations, which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes. However, the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are more profitable. Our Commitment to Quality initiative is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge. We continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care. As a result of these efforts, our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care. We believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction, potentially improving our volumes as a result. Bad Debt Like other organizations in the health care industry, we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans. The discounting components of our Compact with Uninsured Patients (Compact) have reduced our provision for doubtful accounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, but they do not mitigate the net economic effects of treating uninsured or underinsured patients. We continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts. Our collection efforts have improved, and we continue to focus, where applicable, on placement of patients in various government programs such as Medicaid. However, unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses, we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue. Cost Pressures Labor and supply expenses remain a significant cost pressure facing us as well as the industry in general. Controlling labor costs in an environment of fluctuating patient volumes and increased labor union activity will continue to be a challenge. Also, inflation and technology improvements are driving supply costs higher, and our efforts to control supply costs through product standardization, bulk purchases and improved utilization are constantly challenged. General Economic Conditions The current economic downturn, tightening in the credit markets, and instability in the banking and financial institution industries has not yet had a direct material impact on our volumes, but has affected our ability to collect outstanding receivables. In addition, a significant amount of our admissions comes through our emergency rooms and, therefore, is not usually materially impacted by broad economic factors. However, our levels of elective procedures and our ability to collect accounts receivable, due to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment, may be materially impacted if the current economic environment continues. We could also be negatively affected if California, Florida or other states reduce funding of Medicaid and other state healthcare programs. 30 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide challenges, including fluctuating volumes, decreased demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt, that have negatively affected our revenue growth and operating expenses. We believe our future profitability will be achieved through volume growth, appropriate reimbursement levels and cost control across our portfolio of hospitals. Because we believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect the trends we are currently experiencing with respect to volumes, revenues and expenses, we have provided below detailed information about these metrics for the three months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. In order to disclose trends using data comparable to the prior year, operating statistics in this section and throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis are presented on a same hospital basis, where noted, and exclude the results of Coastal Carolina Medical Center and Sierra Providence East Medical Center, for which we did not yet have a full calendar year of operating results at the beginning of the three months ended December 31, 2008. Same Hospital ContinuingOperations Three Months EndedDecember 31, Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Commercial managed care admissions 34,734 35,809 (3.0 )% Governmental managed care admissions 28,542 25,930 10.1 % Medicare admissions 39,452 40,419 (2.4 )% Medicaid admissions 16,102 16,502 (2.4 )% Uninsured admissions 5,957 6,331 (5.9 )% Charity care admissions 2,269 2,293 (1.0 )% Other admissions 3,328 3,330 (0.1 )% Total admissions 130,384 130,614 (0.2 )% Paying admissions (excludes charity and uninsured) 122,158 121,990 0.1 % Charity admissions and uninsured admissions 8,226 8,624 (4.6 )% Admissions through emergency department 73,570 72,106 2.0 % Commercial managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions 26.6 % 27.4 % (0.8 )%(1) Emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions 56.4 % 55.2 % 1.2 %(1) Uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions 4.6 % 4.8 % (0.2 )%(1) Charity admissions as a percentage of total admissions 1.7 % 1.8 % (0.1 )%(1) Surgeries inpatient 38,713 38,727 Surgeries outpatient 52,201 50,333 3.7 % Total surgeries 90,914 89,060 2.1 % Patient days total 636,724 643,533 (1.1 )% Adjusted patient days(2) 924,882 917,133 0.8 % Patient days commercial managed care 138,117 143,385 (3.7 )% Average length of stay (days) 4.9 4.9 (1) Adjusted patient admissions(2) 190,535 187,589 1.6 % (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2007. (2) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Our Florida and Central regions achieved the strongest admissions growth in the three months ended December 31, 2008, and our Central region achieved its second highest growth of the year in that period. Our California region experienced a decline in admissions in the three months ended December 31, 2008, which was its only negative growth of the year. Both our Southern States region and our Philadelphia market had admissions declines during the period. While total same hospital admissions declined by 0.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2008, paying admissions grew by 0.1%. There was also a 4.6% decline in uninsured and charity admissions. Commercial managed care admissions declined by 3.0% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2007, but improved relative to the 3.4% year over year decline reported in the three months ended September 30, 2008. A decline in obstetrics volumes accounted for 59% of our decline in commercial managed care admissions in the three months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Under our Targeted Growth 31 Table of Contents Initiative, we have deemphasized the obstetrics service line in a significant number of hospitals. Surgery growth remained strong in the three months ended December 31, 2008, supported by growth in outpatient surgeries of 3.7%. Inpatient surgeries were flat relative to the three months ended December 31, 2007. Our Targeted Growth Initiative brought incremental focus to a number of the service lines that contributed to this growth in surgeries. Same Hospital ContinuingOperations Three Months EndedDecember 31, Outpatient Visits 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Total visits 929,750 932,837 (0.3 )% Paying visits (excludes charity and uninsured) 830,633 823,364 0.9 % Uninsured visits 93,063 104,278 (10.8 )% Uninsured visits as a percentage of total visits 10.0 % 11.2 % (1.2 )%(1) Charity care visits 6,054 5,195 16.5 % Charity care visits as a percentage of total visits 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.1 %(1) Surgery visits 52,201 50,333 3.7 % Commercial managed care visits 355,424 356,303 (0.2 )% Commercial visits as a percentage of total visits 38.2 % 38.2 % (1) (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2007. While total same hospital outpatient visits declined by 0.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2008, paying outpatient visits (which excludes uninsured and charity outpatient visits) increased by 0.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. Competition from physician owned enterprises offering outpatient services continues to restrain our growth in outpatient volumes. Our recent acquisitions of outpatient facilities added 2,053 outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2008 and was more than offset by 3,928 lost visits resulting from recent divestitures and the joint venturing of some of our existing outpatient facilities where we took a minority interest. Excluding the impact of this resultant net loss of 1,875 outpatient visits from acquisitions and divestitures, outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2008 would have declined by 1,212 visits, or 0.1%. Same Hospital ContinuingOperations Three Months EndedDecember 31, Revenues 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues $ 2,172 $ 2,070 4.9 % Net patient revenue from commercial managed care $ 872 $ 818 6.6 % Revenues from the uninsured $ 148 $ 155 (4.5 )% Net operating revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2008 include $8 million from the partial reversal of a $17 million unfavorable adjustment recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2008 related to a graduate medical education reimbursement dispute at one of our California hospitals. Excluding this $8 million from net operating revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2008, net operating revenues would have increased by $94 million, or 4.5%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2007. As the charge reversal was recorded in other revenue, our patient pricing statistics for the three months ended December 31, 2008 were unaffected. Prior year cost report adjustments contributed $2 million to net operating revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2008. Prior year cost report adjustments made no contribution to net operating revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2007. 32 Table of Contents Same Hospital ContinuingOperations Three Months EndedDecember 31, Revenues on a Per Patient Day, Per Admission and Per Visit Basis 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Net inpatient revenue per admission $ 11,052 $ 10,665 3.6 % Net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 2,263 $ 2,165 4.5 % Net outpatient revenue per visit $ 691 $ 646 7.0 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient admission(1) $ 10,933 $ 10,643 2.7 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient day(1) $ 2,252 $ 2,177 3.4 % Managed care: net inpatient revenue per admission $ 11,803 $ 11,284 4.6 % Managed care: net outpatient revenue per visit $ 808 $ 759 6.5 % (1) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Pricing improvement was evident across all key metrics, primarily reflecting the improved terms of our commercial managed care contracts. Outpatient pricing again outpaced the growth in inpatient pricing due to an improving mix of procedures performed in our outpatient facilities. Our investment and development of higher end procedures in both the surgery and imaging areas of our outpatient business, as well as recent acquisitions, have contributed to this improving mix. Same Hospital ContinuingOperations Three Months EndedDecember 31, Selected Operating Expenses 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Salaries, wages and benefits $ 957 $ 942 1.6 % Supplies $ 384 $ 364 5.5 % Other operating expenses $ 467 $ 473 (1.3 )% Total $ 1,808 $ 1,779 1.6 % Rent/lease expense(1) $ 35 $ 34 2.9 % Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day(2) $ 1,035 $ 1,027 0.8 % Supplies per adjusted patient day(2) $ 415 $ 397 4.5 % Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day(2) $ 505 $ 516 (2.1 )% Total per adjusted patient day $ 1,955 $ 1,940 0.8 % (1) Included in other operating expenses. (2) Adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. On a per adjusted patient day basis, salaries, wages and benefits increased 0.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. This increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees and increased health benefits costs, partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount, reduced contract labor expense, improved workers compensation loss experience and lower incentive compensation costs. Contract labor expense, which is included in salaries, wages and benefits, was $30 million in the three months ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $6 million, or 16.7%, as compared to the same period in 2007. Supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by 4.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. The increase in supplies expense is primarily due to the increased number of surgeries as well as the use of certain new, higher cost drugs. A portion of the increase in supplies expense relates to revenue growth for increased reimbursements from certain payers. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day decreased by 2.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. Included in this decrease was a significant decline in malpractice expense. On a total hospital basis, malpractice expense declined to $18 million in the three months ended December 31, 2008 from $36 million in the same period in 2007, a decline of $18 million or 50%. This decrease is primarily attributable to improved claims experience and was partially offset by $4 million of incremental expenses related to a lower interest rate environment that increased the discounted present value of projected future liabilities. Other operating expenses were also impacted by higher physician fees (reflecting increases in emergency department on call payments), increases in costs of contracted services, as well as repair and maintenance costs. Declining consulting costs also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses. 33 Table of Contents Same Hospital ContinuingOperations Three Months EndedDecember 31, Provision for Doubtful Accounts 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Provision for doubtful accounts $ 163 $ 133 22.6 % Provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues 7.5 % 6.4 % 1.1 %(1) Collection rate from self pay 33 % 35 % (2.0 )%(1) Collection rate from managed care payers 98 % 98 % (1) (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2007. Provision for doubtful accounts increased by $30 million, or 22.6%, despite declines in uninsured admissions and outpatient visits of 5.9% and 10.8%, respectively. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts resulted from the decline in our self pay collection rate, which decreased to approximately 33% from 35% in the in the three months ended December 31, 2007, higher pricing, higher patient insurance deductibles, and a favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts in 2007 that did not recur. CASH FLOW DATA FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents were $507 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $5 million from $512 million at September 30, 2008. Significant cash flow items in the three months ended December 31, 2008 included: (1) Capital expenditures of $134 million, consisting of $130 million in continuing operations and $4 million in discontinued operations; (2) Interest payments of $70 million; (3) $22 million in principal payments (excluding interest of $2 million) classified as operating cash outflows from continuing operations related to our 2006 civil settlement with the federal government; (4) A $39 million decline in the cash and cash equivalents balance related to our Medicare health maintenance organization insurance subsidiary operating in Louisiana, primarily due to the timing of monthly payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is classified as a discontinued operations cash outflow from operations; (5) Cash distributions of $34 million we received related to our investment in the Reserve Yield Plus Fund, which are classified as investing activity cash flows; and (6) Insurance recoveries of $14 million related to our December 2004 Redding Medical Center litigation settlement; based on the components of the recoveries, $5 million was classified as operating cash flows from continuing operations and $9 million was classified as operating cash flows from discontinued operations. SOURCES OF REVENUE We receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources, primarily managed care payers and the federal Medicare program, as well as state Medicaid programs, indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients (i.e., patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement). 34 Table of Contents The table below shows the sources of net patient revenues on a same hospital basis, expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources: Years Ended December 31, Net Patient Revenues from: 2008 2007 2006 Medicare 25.4 % 25.9 % 26.9 % Medicaid 8.4 % 8.8 % 10.1 % Managed care governmental 13.5 % 12.1 % 10.3 % Managed care commercial 41.3 % 41.0 % 40.4 % Indemnity, self pay and other 11.4 % 12.2 % 12.3 % Our payer mix on a same hospital admissions basis, expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources, is shown below: Years Ended December 31, Admissions from: 2008 2007 2006 Medicare 30.7 % 31.6 % 32.7 % Medicaid 12.4 % 12.5 % 12.8 % Managed care governmental 21.1 % 18.9 % 17.5 % Managed care commercial 26.8 % 27.9 % 28.1 % Indemnity, self pay and other 9.0 % 9.1 % 8.9 % The increase in managed care governmental admissions is primarily due to a shift from traditional government programs to managed government programs. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS The Medicare program, the nations largest health insurance program, is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals 65 years of age and older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with end stage renal disease, and is provided without regard to income or assets. Medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources, and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nations poor and most vulnerable individuals. These government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future, as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced, if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited, or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government health care program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents Medicare Medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits. One option, the Original Medicare Plan, is a fee for service payment system. The other option, called Medicare Advantage, includes health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, private fee for service Medicare special needs plans and Medicare medical savings account plans. The major components of our net patient revenues for services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are set forth in the table below: Years Ended December 31, Revenue Descriptions 2008 2007 2006 Diagnosis related group operating $ 1,177 $ 1,139 $ 1,149 Diagnosis related group capital 110 112 115 Outlier 67 64 66 Outpatient 380 342 322 Disproportionate share 212 200 192 Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education 110 103 101 Other(1) 92 64 61 Adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances 4 43 31 Total Medicare net patient revenues $ 2,152 $ 2,067 $ 2,037 (1) The other revenue category includes one skilled nursing facility, inpatient psychiatric units, one inpatient rehabilitation hospital, inpatient rehabilitation units, one long term acute care hospital, other revenue adjustments, and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances. A general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan is provided below. Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found under Regulatory and Legislative Changes. Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System Medicare Severity Adjusted Diagnosis Related Group Payments Sections 1886(d) and 1886(g) of the Social Security Act (the Act) set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system. Under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), Medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge. Discharges are classified according to a system of Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups (MS DRGs), which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources. CMS assigns to each MS DRG a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular MS DRG, relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all MS DRGs. The base payment amount for the operating component of the MS DRG payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share. Both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs, respectively. These base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the MS DRG assigned to each case. The MS DRG operating and capital base rates, relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually, with consideration given to: the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals; the relative costs associated with each MS DRG; and changes in labor data by geographic area. Although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials, the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospitals operating and capital costs. Outlier Payments Outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals for treating Medicare patients who are costlier to treat than the average patient in the same MS DRG. To qualify as a cost outlier, a hospitals billed charges, adjusted to cost, must exceed the payment rate for the MS DRG by a fixed threshold established annually by CMS. The Medicare fiscal intermediary calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospitals most recent filed cost report. Generally, if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the MS DRG payment plus the fixed threshold, the hospital receives 80% of the difference as an outlier payment. Under the Act, CMS must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all prospective payment system (PPS) hospitals to be not less than 5% or more than 6% of total MS DRG payments (Outlier Percentage). The Outlier Percentage is 36 Table of Contents determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of MS DRG and outlier payments. CMS annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit. A change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing: (1) the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments; and (2) the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify. Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients. Disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by CMS and are calculated as a percentage add on to the MS DRG payments. This percentage varies, depending on several factors that include the percentage of low income patients served. During 2008, 42 of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for DSH payments. Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education The Medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions. This additional reimbursement, which is subject to certain limits, including intern and resident full time equivalent (FTE) limits established in 1996, is made in the form of Direct Graduate Medical Education (GME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME) payments. During 2008, 13 of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments. Medicare rules permit hospitals to enter into Medicare GME Affiliation Agreements for the purpose of applying the FTE limits on an aggregate basis, and some of our hospitals have entered into such agreements. We have been contacted by CMS in connection with GME FTE limits and related reimbursement at Doctors Medical Center in Modesto, California as a result of our 1997 transaction with a county owned hospital in Modesto. We have annually collected approximately $2.5 million of GME reimbursement at the hospital. We replied to CMS that, based on our analysis of the transaction and the applicable CMS rules, we believe that the GME FTE limits and related reimbursement reported on the hospitals cost reports were substantially correct. In January 2008, CMS preliminarily advised us that they disagree with our analysis. During the three months ended June 30, 2008, we submitted additional information to CMS regarding the original transaction. CMS subsequently contacted us and stated that: (1) they continue to disagree with our analysis; and (2) they instructed our fiscal intermediary to reopen settled cost reports to recover IME and GME payments made to the hospital. During the three months ended September 30, 2008, we submitted additional information for CMS consideration. Also during the three months ended September 30, 2008, we received notices from our fiscal intermediary of its intent to reopen certain cost reports in connection with this matter. We have since received settlement notices for the hospitals 2001 through 2007 cost reporting periods that reflect a disallowance of all of the hospitals IME and GME payments, and the hospitals 2008 cost report was filed consistent with the fiscal intermediarys disallowance on the prior year cost reports. Additionally, the fiscal intermediary ceased making IME and GME interim payments to the hospital for current and future services. Although we are pursuing a reversal of CMS decision, the outcome is uncertain at this time. As a result, in the three months ended June 30, 2008, we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $17 million ($16 million related to prior years and $1 million related to the current year), and we have not subsequently recorded any IME or GME revenue for this hospital. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, Stanislaus County confirmed its obligation with respect to a residency program funding grant agreement between Doctors Medical Center and the County; as a result, we recorded an $8 million receivable for that additional grant funding. Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Under the outpatient prospective payment system, hospital outpatient services, except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule, are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (APCs). Services in each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require, and a payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, hospitals may be paid for more than one APC for an encounter. CMS periodically updates the APCs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each APC. Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System The inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system (IPF PPS) applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system. The IPF PPS includes several provisions to ease the transition to this system from the previous cost based system. For example, CMS phased in the IPF PPS for existing hospitals and units over a three year period to avoid disrupting the delivery of inpatient psychiatric services. All of our hospitals psychiatric units transitioned to the IPF PPS on or before June 1, 2008. The IPF PPS, which is based on prospectively determined per diem rates, includes a stop loss provision to protect providers against significant losses during the transition period, and an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases. 37 Table of Contents Inpatient Rehabilitation Prospective Payment System Rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by CMS are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) under the IRF prospective payment system (IRF PPS). Payments under the IRF PPS are made on a per discharge basis. A patient classification system is used to assign patients in IRFs into case mix groups. The IRF PPS uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups. Prior to July 1, 2004, a rehabilitation hospital or unit was eligible for classification as an IRF if it could show that, during its most recent 12 month cost reporting period, it served an inpatient population of which at least 75 percent of the patients required intensive rehabilitation services for the treatment of one or more of ten specific conditions. This became known as the 75 percent rule. On May 7, 2004, CMS released a final rule entitled Medicare Program; Changes to the Criteria for Being Classified as an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility that revised the medical condition criteria rehabilitation hospitals and units must meet. This rule also replaced the 75 percent rule compliance threshold with a three year transition compliance threshold of 50%, 60% and 65% for years one, two and three, respectively, then a return to 75% in year four, commencing with cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2004. The three year transition period was later delayed by one year, and then was permanently set at 60% in 2007. See Regulatory and Legislative Changes below. As of December 31, 2008, our inpatient rehabilitation hospital and all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required 60% compliance threshold. Cost Reports The final determination of certain Medicare payments to our hospitals, such as DSH, GME, IME and bad debt expense, are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports. The final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal, and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. For filed cost reports, we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. Medicaid Medicaid programs are funded by both the federal government and state governments. These programs and the reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year. Estimated payments under various state Medicaid programs, excluding state funded managed care Medicaid programs, constituted approximately 8.4%, 8.8% and 10.1% of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These payments are typically based on fixed rates determined by the individual states. We also receive DSH payments under various state Medicaid programs. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our revenue attributable to DSH payments and other state funded subsidy payments was approximately $155 million $165 million, and $157 million, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Medicaid patient revenues by state for the year ended December 31, 2008 are set forth in the table below: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 Florida $ 167 California 133 Georgia 83 Missouri 73 Pennsylvania 56 Texas 52 South Carolina 49 Nebraska 25 North Carolina 25 Alabama 23 Louisiana 10 Tennessee 8 $ 704 Several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Further, although most states addressed projected 2008/2009 budgetary gaps in their final budgets, because of the recent economic downturn, many states are facing mid year budget gaps that could result in additional reductions to Medicaid payments, coverage and eligibility or additional taxes on hospitals. Based on a recent report, at least 45 states are projecting budget shortfalls in their 2008 and or 2009 budgets. For example: In Florida, the legislature held a special session in January 2009 to address the states budget deficit and proposed several changes for consideration in the full legislative session that commenced February 1, 2009. If enacted as proposed, the changes would result in a 4% across the board reduction in Medicaid rates effective July 1, 2009. We estimate that the annual impact of these changes on our Florida hospitals revenues would be a reduction of approximately $5 million to $8 million in 2009. On September 23, 2008, the Governor of California signed into law a budget containing more than $544 million in reductions to Medi Cal, the states Medicaid program, for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008. Under the budget, a 10% reduction to certain Medi Cal provider payments is in effect until March 1, 2009, when the 10% reduction will be reduced to 1%. At this time, we estimate that these payment reductions will reduce our revenues by approximately $9 million in 2009. The reductions also apply to capitation payments to Medi Cal managed care plans; however, we cannot estimate at this time what impact the reductions will have on such payments. In addition to provider payment reductions, the budget includes payment deferrals and reductions in coverage. On December 31, 2008, a new budget plan for California was released to address budget deficits in the current year as well as the new fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. The new plan includes a one month payment deferral in 2009 in addition to the previous payment deferral already budgeted, elimination of some benefits and further reductions in coverage. At this time, we cannot estimate the impact on our revenues from these proposed budget cuts. Further, we cannot predict the extent of the impact on our hospitals of future actions the states might take to address additional budgetary shortfalls. Although legislation has been introduced to provide additional federal funding to states facing budgetary shortfalls, we cannot predict what action Congress will take on the legislation and the impact, if any, of such legislation on our hospitals. In May 2007, CMS issued a final rule, Medicaid Program; Cost Limit for Providers Operated by Units of Government and Provisions to Ensure the Integrity of the Federal State Financial Partnership, that places limits and restrictions on Medicaid reimbursement to safety net hospitals. A one year moratorium on implementation of the final rule was included in the federal fiscal year (FFY) 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Act, which meant that the rule could not take effect before May 25, 2008. On May 21, 2008, CMS announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional 60 days; then in June 2008 the moratorium was extended through March 31, 2009 as part of the FFY 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act. Congress is currently considering legislation that would extend the moratorium until June 30, 2009. We cannot predict what further action, if any, Congress or CMS may take to extend the moratorium or implement the final rule. However, the provisions of the rule could materially reduce the amount of Medicaid payments we receive in the future. 39 Table of Contents Also in May 2007, CMS issued a proposed rule clarifying that the agency would no longer provide federal Medicaid matching funds for GME purposes; however, the FFY 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Act contained language that placed a one year moratorium on any such restriction. The moratorium was scheduled to expire on May 23, 2008. On May 21, 2008, CMS announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional 60 days; then in June 2008 the moratorium was extended through March 31, 2009 as part of the FFY 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act. Congress is currently considering legislation that would extend the moratorium until June 30, 2009. Annual Medicaid GME payments to our hospitals are approximately $35 million. We cannot predict what further action, if any, Congress or CMS will take on this issue. Regulatory and Legislative Changes Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems are provided below. Annual Update to the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System Under Medicare law, CMS is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system. The updates generally become effective October 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. On July 31, 2008, CMS issued the Final Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and FFY 2009 Rates (Final Rule). The Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: A market basket increase of 3.6% for MS DRG operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data (hospitals that do not report specified quality measure data will receive an increase of 1.6%); A 0.9% increase in the capital federal MS DRG rate; An increase in the number of quality measures hospitals would need to report in FFY 2009 in order to qualify for the full market basket update from 30 in FFY 2009 to 42 in FFY 2010; An across the board reduction of 0.9% as required by the Transitional Medical Assistance, Abstinence Education, and Qualifying Individuals Programs Extension Act of 2007 to offset the effect of changes in documentation and or coding or the classification of discharges that do not reflect real changes in case mix; Further implementation of a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 preventing Medicare from giving hospitals higher payments for the additional costs of treating a patient that acquires a condition (including an infection) during a hospital stay by adding three hospital acquired conditions; and A decrease in the cost outlier threshold from $22,185 to $20,185 (which was later further reduced to $20,045 as described below). As a result of recent legislation affecting wage index reclassifications, CMS did not have sufficient time between the passage of the legislation and the deadline for publication of the Final Rule to recalculate wage indices based on the new reclassification data. On September 29, 2008, CMS issued the Final FFY 2009 Rates Notice (2009 Rate Notice), which contains the final FFY 2009 wage indices and payment rates. In addition to revising the wage indices and standardized amounts, the cost outlier threshold was further reduced to $20,045. CMS projects that the combined impact of the final payment and policy changes will yield an average 5.2% increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas (populations over 1 million). This includes CMS estimate of a 1.8% increase in payments resulting from improved coding and documentation. Based on an analysis of the payment and policy changes in the Final Rule, including the impact of the 2009 Rate Notice, as applied to our hospitals, the estimated annual impact is an increase in our Medicare inpatient revenues of approximately $45 million. Because of the uncertainty of other factors that may influence our future IPPS payments by individual hospital, including admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. In addition to the 0.9% across the board reduction described above, the Transitional Medical Assistance, Abstinence Education, and Qualifying Individuals Programs Extension Act of 2007 specifies that, to the extent the documentation and coding adjustments applied in FFY 2008 and FFY 2009 result in overpayments or underpayments relative to the actual amount of documentation and coding related increases, CMS shall correct the overpayments and underpayments in fiscal years 2010 2012. A determination of overpayment will result in a reduction of Medicare inpatient payments in those years. We expect CMS to address the documentation and coding adjustments in the FFY 2010 proposed rule to be issued during 2009; however, we cannot predict at this time how CMS will conduct the final analysis or the outcome of the final determination, or estimate the potential impact on our revenues. 40 Table of Contents Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System On July 31, 2008, CMS issued the Final Rule for the Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System for FFY 2009 (IRF PPS Final Rule). The IRF PPS Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: An increase in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from $7,362 to $10,250; and An update to the case mix group relative weights and average length of stay values using FFY 2006 data. CMS is also implementing the following statutorily mandated provisions of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007: A compliance threshold held at 60% for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2006; A continuation of counting comorbidities when determining an IRFs compliance with the threshold; and An update to the IRF PPS payment rate equal to 0% effective for discharges beginning on and after April 1, 2008 through FFY 2009. At December 31, 2008, we operated one inpatient rehabilitation hospital, and 13 of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient rehabilitation units. CMS projects that the payment and policy changes will result in an estimated total decrease in aggregate IRF payments of $40 million or 0.7% of total IRF PPS payments for FFY 2009. This decrease is due to the update to the outlier threshold amount to reduce estimated outlier payments from 3.7% for FFY 2008 to 3.0% for FFY 2009. We do not believe that the statutorily mandated or IRF PPS Final Rule changes will have a material impact on our net operating revenues. Because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future IRF payments, including admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, and the impact of compliance with the IRF admission criteria, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes. Payment Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System On May 1, 2008, CMS issued a Notice of the Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Facility (IPF) Prospective Payment System Update for the rate year beginning July 1, 2008 (IPF PPS Notice). The IPF PPS Notice includes the following payment changes: An update to the IPF payment equal to the market basket of 3.2%; and A decrease in the fixed dollar loss threshold amount for outlier payments from $6,488 to $6,113. At December 31, 2008, 14 of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient psychiatric units. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment changes will yield an average 2.5% increase in payments for all IPFs (including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals), and an average 0.4% increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas. Using the urban unit impact percentage as applied to our Medicare IPF payments for the 12 months ended June 30, 2008, we do not believe the payment changes will have a material impact on our net operating revenues. Because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future IPF payments, including admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes. 41 Table of Contents Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System On October 30, 2008, CMS issued the Final Changes to the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System and Calendar Year 2009 Payment Rates (OPPS Final Rule). The OPPS Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: A 3.6% inflation update in Medicare payment rates for hospital outpatient services paid under the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS); For purposes of the calendar year (CY) 2010 update, an increase in the number of measures that hospitals are required to report to receive the full CY 2010 market basket update from four measures in CY 2008 to 11 measures in CY 2009; and Making a single payment for multiple services of a particular type (such as multiple ultrasound procedures) performed in a single hospital session (in addition to ultrasound, CMS will apply this policy to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging services). CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the OPPS Final Rule will yield an average 3.9% increase in payments for all hospitals and an average 4.1% increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas (populations over 1 million). According to the CMS hospital specific OPPS Final Rule impact file, the 2009 increase in our Medicare outpatient revenues is expected to be approximately $12 million. Because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future OPPS payments, including volumes and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. Payments for Emergency Health Services Provided to Undocumented Aliens Section 1011 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 provides $250 million each year for FFYs 2005 2008 to eligible providers for emergency services furnished to undocumented and other specified aliens. The statutory authorization for the funding of that program expired on September 30, 2008, although CMS indicated that payments to providers would continue after that date until all allocated funds are exhausted. The fiscal intermediary assigned to process the Section 1011 claims recently announced that CMS has approved payment for medical services delivered on or before March 31, 2009. Congress considered legislation to provide additional funding for the program in 2009, but ultimately took no action. We cannot predict whether Congress will provide new funding in 2009 or when currently allocated funds will be exhausted. Our hospitals received approximately $5 million in Section 1011 payments in calendar year 2008. TRICARE Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System TRICARE is the managed care component of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Military Health System. It provides benefits to active duty members of the United States armed services, including some National Guard and Reserve members, and military retirees, as well as their dependents. TRICARE brings together the health care resources of the uniformed services and supplements them with networks of civilian health care professionals, institutions, pharmacies and suppliers. In Section 707 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, Congress mandated that TRICARE payment methods and amounts for institutional care should be determined, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules used by Medicare. Medicare outpatient reimbursement amounts are generally lower than current TRICARE rates. On December 8, 2008, the DOD issued a final rule, with an effective date of January 1, 2009, to implement a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services under TRICARE that is modeled after the Medicare outpatient prospective payment system. In that final rule, the DOD estimates that the TRICARE outpatient payment and policy changes will result in a reduction of approximately 25% from current payment levels for urban hospitals. We estimate that implementation of the new outpatient payment system could reduce annual TRICARE payments to our hospitals by approximately $10 million. On February 5, 2009, the DOD released a rule that delays the effective date of the new TRICARE outpatient payment system until May 1, 2009 and invited additional public comment on the final rule. Because of uncertainty regarding the final rule and other factors that may influence our future TRICARE outpatient payments, including volumes and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. 42 Table of Contents Long Term Care Hospitals On May 2, 2008, CMS issued a final rule for long term care hospital that provides for a 2.7% increase in the payment rate and increases the fixed outlier threshold from $20,738 to $22,960. CMS estimates that the changes adopted in the final rule will increase total payments to long term care hospitals by approximately 2.5%. We operate one long term care hospital. CMS Medicare Value Based Purchasing Program Report Congress, through Section 5001(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, authorized the Secretary of HHS to develop a plan to implement value based purchasing (VBP) commencing in FFY 2009 for Medicare hospital services paid under the IPPS. By statute, the plan must include consideration of: (1) the development and selection of measures of quality and efficiency in inpatient settings; (2) reporting, collection and validation of quality data; (3) the structure, size and source of value based payment adjustments; and (4) disclosure of information on hospital performance. On November 21, 2007, CMS issued a report to Congress with its plan to implement a VBP program. In the report, CMS proposes to transform Medicare from a passive payer of claims to an active purchaser of care. The options in the report build on the foundation of the current program of reporting hospital quality data for the annual payment update, which ties a portion of the IPPS annual payment update to a hospital meeting certain requirements, including reporting on a defined set of inpatient quality measures. Under CMS proposal, its VBP program would phase out those requirements and would make a portion of a hospitals payments contingent on actual performance on specified measures, rather than simply on the hospitals reporting data for these measures. Under VBP, payments to high performing hospitals would be larger than those to lower performing hospitals because the IPPS would be used to provide financial incentives to drive improvements in clinical quality, patient centeredness and efficiency. Public reporting of performance on Medicares Hospital Compare website, a key component of the current reporting program, would remain an essential component of VBP. On September 25, 2008, the Quality First Act was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would have established a program of performance based payment for Medicare inpatient services starting in FFY 2011; however, the 110th Congress adjourned without taking action on the bill. We cannot predict what action the new Congress or CMS under the new Administration may take with respect to the development or implementation of a VBP program, nor can we predict at this time what impact, if any, a VBP program might have on our results of operations or cash flows. Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Initiative Section 306 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 directed the Secretary of HHS to demonstrate the use of RACs under CMS Medicare Integrity Program in identifying underpayments and overpayments under the Medicare program, and recouping those overpayments. RACs are third party organizations under contract with CMS, and the law provides that compensation paid to each RAC be based on a percentage of overpayment recoveries identified by the RAC. The RAC demonstration was slated to end in March 2008; however, Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the RAC program permanent and instructed CMS to use RACs to identify Medicare underpayments and overpayments nationwide by 2010. In November 2007, CMS released the revised RAC Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW included several improvements, including placing certain restrictions on the claims subject to review by the RACs, and it delayed implementation of the RAC program in some states. Several of our hospitals included in the RAC demonstration received notices of overpayments resulting from RAC reviews. The overpayment determinations are subject to reconsideration and appeal through various forums, and we will pursue the reversal of the determinations where appropriate; however, we cannot predict the outcome of the appeals. In addition to overpayments identified by the RACs that are not reversed, we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials. On October 6, 2008, CMS announced the names of the new national RACs and according to CMS timetable, the new RACs were to begin reviews in December 2008. However, two unsuccessful bidders protested the awarding of the permanent contracts, and all RAC activity was stopped pending a determination by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In February 2009, the two unsuccessful bidders withdrew their protests, and CMS announced that it is taking steps to resume its rollout of the permanent RAC program beginning March 2009. We cannot predict the impact of future RAC reviews on our results of operations or cash flows. MedPAC Recommendations The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent Congressional agency established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. The Commissions statutory mandate is quite broad; in addition to advising Congress on payments to private health plans participating in Medicare and providers in Medicares traditional fee for service program, MedPAC is also tasked with analyzing access to care, quality of care and other issues affecting Medicare. 43 Table of Contents On January 8, 2009, MedPAC voted on final recommendations for their March 2009 Report to Congress. Their final recommendations affecting hospital payments include the following: Congress should increase payment rates for the acute inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems for 2010 by the projected rate of increase in the hospital market basket index concurrent with the implementation of a quality program; and Congress should reduce the IME adjustment in 2010 by 1% to 4.5% per 10% increment in the resident to bed ratio, and the funds obtained by reducing the IME adjustment should be used to fund a quality incentive payment program. We cannot predict what actions, if any, Congress or CMS may take with respect to MedPACs recommendations or what impact those actions may have on our operations. Any actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows. Regulations Addressing Serious Medical Events In an effort to encourage hospitals to improve quality of care, the Medicare program and certain state Medicaid programs have taken steps to reduce or withhold payments to hospitals for treatment given to patients whose conditions were caused by serious medical error. Under rules that went into effect on October 1, 2008, Medicare will no longer pay hospitals for the higher costs of care resulting from eight complications, including falls, objects left inside patients during surgery, pressure ulcers and three types of hospital acquired infections. Certain states have established policies or proposed legislation to prohibit hospitals from charging or receiving payment from their Medicaid programs for highly preventable adverse medical events (sometimes called serious reportable events or never events), which were developed by the National Quality Forum, a non profit organization that seeks to improve the quality of American healthcare. Also, some states impose fines and penalties on hospitals when these events occur. Serious reportable events include wrong site surgery, serious medication mistakes and discharging a baby to the wrong mother, among others. Hospitals in some states, including California, are required to report certain adverse events to a state agency charged with publicizing the events, as well as the results of any ensuing investigation conducted by the agency. We believe that our Commitment to Quality initiative, which utilizes the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care, reduces our exposure to serious reportable events, but we are unable to predict the future impact of this development on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Medicare, Medicaid and State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Extension Act of 2007 The State Childrens Health Insurance Program provides health insurance to poor children. SCHIP is jointly financed, under the provisions of the Social Security Act, by federal and state governments and administered by the states. Within broad federal guidelines, each state determines the design of its program, eligibility groups, benefit packages, payment levels for coverage, and administrative and operating procedures. SCHIP provided a capped amount of funds to states on a matching basis through September 30, 2007, when it expired. The Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, which was signed into law on December 29, 2007, extended funding through March 31, 2009. On February 4, 2009, the President signed the State Childrens Health Insurance Program bill, which extends the SCHIP program by 4.5 years and expands the program to an additional 4.5 million children. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 On February 17, 2009, the President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 into law. The $787 billion economic stimulus plan includes the following measures affecting medical providers: $21 billion in health insurance assistance, which includes premium subsidies for COBRA continuation coverage for unemployed workers; A freeze until September 30, 2009 of the final rule phasing out Medicare IME capital payments; 44 Table of Contents $90 billion in state fiscal relief, which includes $86.7 billion for a temporary (27 month) increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (the rate at which the federal government matches states Medicaid expenditures), and a 2.5% increase in the states fiscal year 2009 and 2010 DSH payments that would revert to 100% of the payments under current law; and $31 billion in new spending on health information technology, most of which is for incentive payments to physicians and hospitals, which the Congressional Budget Office assumes will generate $12 billion in savings over time, and $2 billion for health information technology grants. We cannot predict how or when these measures will be implemented. We also cannot predict what impact any of the measures might have on our results of operations or cash flows. PRIVATE INSURANCE Managed Care We currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). HMOs generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician, hospital, pharmacy and ancillary service providers that HMO members must access through an assigned primary care physician. The members care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the HMOs quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner. HMOs typically provide no benefit or reimbursement to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care. PPOs generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers. PPO members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit, typically in the form of lower co payments, co insurance or deductibles. As employers and employees have demanded more choice, managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both HMO and PPO plans. The amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $4.6 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. Approximately 61% of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 was derived from our top ten managed care payers. National payers generate approximately 44% of our total net managed care revenues. The remainder comes from regional or local payers. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 55% and 53%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers. We expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term. However, the managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans, which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend. Although we have had fourteen consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing, we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in the future. Through the year ended December 31, 2008, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately 50% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. Indemnity An indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient, subject to an increasing number of policy conditions and exclusions. Unlike an HMO member, a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers. SELF PAY PATIENTS Self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and who do not have some form of private insurance and, therefore, are responsible for their own medical bills. A significant 45 Table of Contents portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment. High acuity treatment is more costly to provide and, therefore, results in higher billings, which are the least collectible of all accounts. We believe our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors, including reductions in state Medicaid budgets, increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance, and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers. Self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 8% and 9%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients. Further, a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients. We have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible. This is just one example of our continuous improvement efforts dedicated to modifying and refining our processes, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. Over the longer term, several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge. For example, our Compact with Uninsured Patients (Compact) is designed to offer managed care style discounts to most uninsured patients, which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges. A significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts. Under the Compact, the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance, which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded. The uninsured patient accounts, net of contractual allowances recorded, are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process. The estimated costs (based on selected operating expenses, which include salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses) of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $361 million, $345 million and $257 million, respectively. We also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. Most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received, subject to a cap. Except for the per diem amounts, our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care; therefore, we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts. Most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospitals eligibility for Medicaid DSH payments. The estimated costs (based on the selected operating expenses described above) of providing charity care for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $113 million, $121 million and $110 million, respectively. 46 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 8,489 $ 7,995 $ 494 Other operations 174 172 2 Net operating revenues 8,663 8,167 496 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 3,816 3,655 161 Supplies 1,528 1,418 110 Provision for doubtful accounts 632 561 71 Other operating expenses, net 1,955 1,876 79 Depreciation and amortization 373 338 35 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries 18 49 (31 ) Hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs (3 ) 3 Litigation and investigation costs 41 13 28 Operating income $ 300 $ 260 $ 40 Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals 98.0 % 97.9 % 0.1 % Other operations 2.0 % 2.1 % (0.1 )% Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 44.0 % 44.8 % (0.8 )% Supplies 17.6 % 17.4 % 0.2 % Provision for doubtful accounts 7.3 % 6.9 % 0.4 % Other operating expenses, net 22.6 % 22.8 % (0.2 )% Depreciation and amortization 4.3 % 4.2 % 0.1 % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries 0.2 % 0.6 % (0.4 )% Hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs % % % Litigation and investigation costs 0.5 % 0.1 % 0.4 % Operating income 3.5 % 3.2 % 0.3 % Net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues, as well as nonpatient revenues (primarily rental income, management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias, gift shops and parking) and other miscellaneous revenue. Net operating revenues of other operations primarily consist of revenues from (1) physician practices, (2) rehabilitation hospitals and (3) a long term care facility. Only one of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% (approximately 5.2%) of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, and none represented more than 5% of our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2008. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $174 million and $172 million in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Equity earnings for unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $13 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing general hospitals on a same hospital basis. We have excluded two hospitals from the same hospital statistics for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The hospitals excluded are Coastal Carolina Medical Center and Sierra Providence East Medical Center, for which we did not yet have a full calendar year of operating results at the beginning of the three months ended December 31, 2008. 47 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Patient Day, Per Admission and Per Visit Amounts) Net inpatient revenues(1) $ 5,724 $ 5,485 4.4 % Net outpatient revenues(1) $ 2,568 $ 2,376 8.1 % Net patient revenue from commercial managed care $ 3,427 $ 3,225 6.3 % Revenues from the uninsured $ 613 $ 609 0.7 % Provision for doubtful accounts $ 623 $ 559 11.4 % Provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues 7.2 % 6.9 % 0.3 %(2) Collection rate from self pay 33 % 35 % (2.0 )%(2) Collection rate from managed care payers 98 % 98 % (2) Number of general hospitals (at end of period) 48 48 (2) Licensed beds (at end of period) 13,411 13,454 (0.3 )% Average licensed beds 13,398 13,431 (0.2 )% Utilization of licensed beds(3) 53.2 % 53.0 % 0.2 %(2) Patient days 2,610,199 2,599,420 0.4 % Adjusted patient days(4) 3,759,463 3,695,444 1.7 % Net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 2,193 $ 2,110 3.9 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient day(4) $ 2,206 $ 2,127 3.7 % Commercial managed care admissions 141,079 145,438 (3.0 )% Governmental managed care admissions 111,166 98,594 12.8 % Medicare admissions 162,010 164,767 (1.7 )% Medicaid admissions 65,535 65,017 0.8 % Uninsured admissions 24,050 23,649 1.7 % Charity care admissions 9,287 10,189 (8.9 )% Other admissions 14,021 13,374 4.8 % Total admissions 527,148 521,028 1.2 % Adjusted patient admissions(4) 764,490 745,917 2.5 % Paying admissions (excludes charity and uninsured) 493,811 487,190 1.4 % Charity admissions and uninsured admissions 33,337 33,838 (1.5 )% Admissions through emergency department 295,473 287,713 2.7 % Commercial managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions 26.8 % 27.9 % (1.1 )%(2) Emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions 56.1 % 55.2 % 0.9 %(2) Uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions 4.6 % 4.5 % 0.1 %(2) Charity admissions as a percentage of total admissions 1.8 % 2.0 % (0.2 )%(2) Net inpatient revenue per admission $ 10,858 $ 10,527 3.1 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient admission (4) $ 10,847 $ 10,539 2.9 % Average length of stay (days) 5.0 5.0 (2) Surgeries inpatient 155,896 154,905 0.6 % Surgeries outpatient 205,117 201,759 1.7 % Total surgeries 361,013 356,664 1.2 % Net outpatient revenue per visit $ 681 $ 629 8.3 % Uninsured outpatient visits 395,991 420,176 (5.8 )% Uninsured outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits 10.5 % 11.1 % (0.6 )%(2) Charity care outpatient visits 21,954 25,367 (13.5 )% Charity care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits 0.6 % 0.7 % (0.1 )%(2) Paying outpatient visits (excludes charity and uninsured) 3,355,514 3,330,676 0.7 % Commercial managed care outpatient visits 1,410,822 1,425,406 (1.0 )% Commercial outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits 37.4 % 37.7 % (0.3 )%(2) Total outpatient visits 3,773,459 3,776,219 (0.1 )% Managed care: net inpatient revenue per admission $ 11,555 $ 11,056 4.5 % Managed care: net outpatient revenue per visit $ 798 $ 742 7.5 % Salaries, wages and benefits $ 3,784 $ 3,648 3.7 % 48 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Patient Day, Per Admission and Per Visit Amounts) Supplies $ 1,521 $ 1,417 7.3 % Other operating expenses $ 1,927 $ 1,868 3.2 % Total salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses $ 7,232 $ 6,933 4.3 % Rent/lease expense(5) $ 139 $ 135 3.0 % Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day(4) $ 1,006 $ 987 1.9 % Supplies per adjusted patient day(4) $ 405 $ 383 5.7 % Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day(4) $ 513 $ 506 1.4 % Total salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses per adjusted patient day $ 1,924 $ 1,876 2.6 % (1) Net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues.

(5) Included in other operating expenses. REVENUES During the year ended December 31, 2008, net operating revenues from continuing operations increased 6.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 4.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. There were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues. Key positive factors include: Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts, partially offset by a reduction in stop loss payments to $241 million in 2008 from $282 million in 2007; and An increase in total admissions and patient days. Key negative factors include: A decrease in commercial managed care admissions; A decrease in DSH payments under various states Medicaid programs to $155 million in 2008 from $165 million in 2007; and Favorable adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances of $4 million in 2008 compared to $46 million in 2007. Same hospital admissions for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 1.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to net volume increases in many of the service lines emphasized by our Targeted Growth Initiative, psychiatric volumes at a facility we acquired in Modesto, California in November 2007, and a net growth in physicians resulting from our general focus on recruitment efforts and our targeted physician recruitment strategies at various hospitals for specific service lines, partially offset by lower invasive cardiac procedures. Same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 8.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, while outpatient visits declined by 0.1% for the same periods. The primary reason for the revenue increase is improved managed care pricing. 49 Table of Contents SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately 2.1% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, an increase in the number of employed physicians, increased health benefits and retirement plans costs, increased annual incentive compensation costs, and hurricane related labor costs, partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount, a decline in contract labor expenses and stock compensation expense, and improved workers compensation loss experience. At December 31, 2008, approximately 21% of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions. Labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory. We, and the hospital industry in general, are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country. As union activity increases, our salaries, wages and benefits expense may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues. We currently have labor contracts and collective bargaining agreements with the California Nurses Association (CNA), the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the United Nurses Associations of California and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that cover registered nurses, service and maintenance workers, and other employees at 10 of our continuing general hospitals in California, three of our continuing general hospitals in Florida and one of our continuing general hospitals in Philadelphia. All of these union agreements set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations through various dates in 2010 and early 2011. In 2008, the CNA and the SEIU commenced union organizing activities at several of our hospitals pursuant to the terms of the separate peace accords we entered into with those unions in 2007. To date, we have granted the CNA access to Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia and three of our hospitals in Houston Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center, Park Plaza Hospital and Houston Northwest Medical Center. We are currently engaged in collective bargaining with the CNA at Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center after registered nurses at that facility voted 119 111 in favor of representation by the CNA in March 2008 and the results of that election were certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in May 2008. In August 2008, two registered nurses from Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center and Park Plaza Hospital, with the help of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, filed unfair labor practice charges against us and the CNA with the NLRB. The charges allege that our peace accord with the CNA violates federal rules prohibiting employer dominated unions and improperly restricts nurses from speaking out against the union. The filing also claims that the peace accord subverts the NLRBs role by stipulating that an arbitrator will resolve conflicts rather than federal board representatives. In February 2009, additional charges were filed with the NLRB relating to our Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. The NLRB is considering all of the claims, and we expect a formal decision shortly; however, we presently cannot determine the ultimate resolution of this matter. Separately, we are defending our actions in connection with the SEIUs failed attempt to organize employees at our Saint Francis Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. A trial in that matter was expected to commence in January 2009, but has since been postponed while the parties engage in settlement discussions. In addition, in January 2009, we executed an agreement with the SEIU postponing for one year any further organizing efforts by that union as contemplated by the terms of our peace accord. Included in salaries, wages and benefits expense in the year ended December 31, 2008 is $33 million of stock based compensation expense compared to $40 million in 2007. The decrease is primarily due to the vesting of higher grant date fair value awards from prior years and the issuance of new awards at lower grant date fair values primarily due to our lower stock price. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues increased by 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, while supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased approximately 5.4% in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day reflects higher costs for orthopedics, pharmaceuticals and implants due to increased volumes, inflation and technology improvements, and higher surgical supply costs due to an increase in surgeries, partially offset by lower cardiovascular supply costs, which resulted from a decrease in cardiovascular procedures. We strive to control supplies expense through product standardization, bulk purchases, contract compliance, improved utilization and operational improvements that should minimize waste. The items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers, orthopedics and implants, and high cost pharmaceuticals. We also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of Broadlane (a company in which we held a 48% interest until August 2008), which offers group purchasing procurement strategy, outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry. 50 Table of Contents PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues was 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The negative impact on bad debts as a result of the growth in self pay accounts assigned to our collection agencies, a slight decline in self pay collection trends since the first half of 2008, pricing increases and improved charge capture in our emergency departments were only partially mitigated by improved point of service collections and improved insurance balances by aging category. The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts Net AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts Net (In Millions) Medicare $ 158 $ $ 158 $ 163 $ $ 163 Medicaid 122 122 134 134 Net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (20 ) (20 ) (15 ) (15 ) Commercial managed care 556 72 484 531 78 453 Governmental managed care 179 179 170 170 Self pay uninsured 191 161 30 192 152 40 Self pay balance after 140 72 68 129 67 62 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agencies 40 40 33 33 Other 178 41 137 210 67 143 Total continuing operations 1,544 346 1,198 1,547 364 1,183 Total discontinued operations 189 50 139 279 77 202 $ 1,733 $ 396 $ 1,337 $ 1,826 $ 441 $ 1,385 A significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients. Collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus, particularly over the past several years, as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix. At December 31, 2008, our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 33%, including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors. During 2008, we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows: 35% at March 31, 2008; 34% at June 30, 2008; and 33% at September 30, 2008. These self pay collection rates include payments made by patients, including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance, prior to an account being classified and assigned to our in house self pay collection group. The comparable self pay collection percentage as of December 31, 2007, adjusted for the reclassification of certain hospitals to discontinued operations, was approximately 35%. Our provision for doubtful accounts in the three months ended December 31, 2008 includes a $3 million unfavorable adjustment in the estimate of necessary bad debt reserve levels at year end compared to a favorable adjustment of $16 million in the three months ended December 31, 2007. The change in anticipated collections as of December 31, 2008 was based on a look back period of 18 months of collections. We have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible. This is just one example of our continuous improvement efforts dedicated to modifying and refining our processes, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. Payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts. We typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes; however, we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services. Our estimated collection rate on managed care accounts was approximately 98% as of both December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, adjusted for hospitals reclassified to discontinued operations, which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors. 51 Table of Contents We continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow. One specific initiative that was started during the three months ended September 30, 2006 and is expected to be completed in 2009 is the Center for Patient Access Services, which is a centralized dedicated operation that performs financial clearance, including completing insurance eligibility checks, documenting verification of benefits, providing required notifications to managed care payers, obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling. Although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable. We manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as (1) total cash collections, (2) point of service cash collections, (3) accounts receivable days outstanding (AR Days), and (4) accounts receivable aging. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our continuing operations net accounts receivable of $1.218 billion and $1.198 billion, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $20 million and $15 million, at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively: December 31, 2008 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 99 % 64 % 77 % 33 % 69 % 61 120 days 1 % 24 % 14 % 24 % 15 % 121 180 days % 12 % 5 % 11 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 4 % 32 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % December 31, 2007 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 96 % 63 % 76 % 34 % 69 % 61 120 days 3 % 25 % 14 % 25 % 16 % 121 180 days 1 % 12 % 5 % 12 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 5 % 29 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 50 days at December 31, 2008 compared to 52 days at December 31, 2007. AR Days at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are within our target of less than 55 days. AR Days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter. As of December 31, 2008, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $4.5 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house and outside collection agencies or vendors. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts at collection agencies is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. Patient advocates from our Medical Eligibility Program (MEP) screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs. They also expedite the process of applying for these government programs. Receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for Medicaid are classified as Medicaid pending, under our MEP, with appropriate contractual allowances recorded. Based on recent trends, approximately 86% of all accounts in our MEP are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as Medicaid. 52 Table of Contents The following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our MEP, still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2008 and 2007, by aging category: December 31, 2008 2007 0 60 days $ 87 $ 59 61 120 days 25 15 121 180 days 6 6 Over 180 days(1) Total $ 118 $ 80 (1) Includes accounts receivable of $10 million at both December 31, 2008 and 2007 that are fully reserved. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased by 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by approximately 2.0% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher physician fees, contracted services, repair and maintenance costs, utility costs and an $8 million gain on a sale of a medical office building in Florida in 2007, which reduced 2007 other operating expenses, partially offset by lower information systems implementation costs, consulting costs and malpractice expense. Malpractice expense was $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $163 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in malpractice expense is primarily attributable to improved claims experience, partially offset by $15 million of incremental expense related to the lower interest rate environment, which increased the discounted present value of projected future liabilities. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $18 million compared to $49 million, net of insurance recoveries of $5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail of these charges and related liabilities. Our impairment tests presume stable or, in some cases, improving results in our hospitals. If these expectations are not met, or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we will incur additional restructuring charges. Future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $41 million compared to $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 amount includes a $47 million increase in the estimated liabilities for wage and hour actions and other unrelated employment matters further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. NET GAIN ON SALES OF INVESMENTS During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded net gains of $125 million on the sale of our entire interest in Broadlane and $14 million on the sale of our interest in a joint venture with a real estate investment trust. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about these amounts. INCOME TAX BENEFIT Income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2008 included: (1) an income tax benefit of $27 million to reduce our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including related interest; and 53 Table of Contents (2) an income tax benefit of $23 million to decrease the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and for other tax adjustments. Income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2007 included: (1) an income tax benefit of $83 million to reduce our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including related interest; and (2) income tax expense of $48 million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and for other tax adjustments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income (loss) from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 7,995 $ 7,605 $ 390 Other operations 172 139 33 Net operating revenues 8,167 7,744 423 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 3,655 3,477 178 Supplies 1,418 1,375 43 Provision for doubtful accounts 561 491 70 Other operating expenses, net 1,876 1,780 96 Depreciation and amortization 338 316 22 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries 49 318 (269 ) Hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs (3 ) (14 ) 11 Litigation and investigation costs 13 766 (753 ) Operating income (loss) $ 260 $ (765 ) $ 1,025 Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals 97.9 % 98.2 % (0.3 )% Other operations 2.1 % 1.8 % 0.3 % Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 44.8 % 44.9 % (0.1 )% Supplies 17.4 % 17.8 % (0.4 )% Provision for doubtful accounts 6.9 % 6.3 % 0.6 % Other operating expenses, net 22.8 % 23.1 % (0.3 )% Depreciation and amortization 4.2 % 4.0 % 0.2 % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries 0.6 % 4.1 % (3.5 )% Hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs % (0.2 )% 0.2 % Litigation and investigation costs 0.1 % 9.9 % (9.8 )% Operating income (loss) 3.2 % (9.9 )% 13.1 % Net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues, as well as nonpatient revenues (primarily rental income, management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias, gift shops 54 Table of Contents and parking) and other miscellaneous revenue. Net operating revenues of other operations primarily consist of revenues from (1) physician practices, (2) rehabilitation hospitals and a long term care facility, and (3) equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates that are not directly associated with our general hospitals. None of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% of our net operating revenues or more than 5% of our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $172 million and $139 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $20 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing general hospitals on a same hospital basis. The impact of our acquisition of Coastal Carolina Medical Center at the end of June 2007 is excluded from same hospital statistics for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Net inpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $275 million and $233 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net outpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $334 million and $268 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2) The change is the difference between the 2007 and 2006 amounts shown. (3) Utilization of licensed beds represents patient days divided by number of days in the period divided by average licensed beds. (4) Adjusted patient admissions/days represent actual patient admissions/days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient admissions/days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues. (5) Included in other operating expense. REVENUES During the year ended December 31, 2007, net operating revenues from continuing operations increased 5.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Same hospital outpatient visits, surgeries, patient days and admissions were lower during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 by 1.7%, 2.6%, 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively. We believe the following factors contributed to the overall decline in our inpatient and outpatient volume levels: (1) loss of patients to competing health care providers; (2) challenges in physician recruitment, retention and attrition, specifically with respect to recruiting physicians at our Florida hospitals to replace doctors who have retired or relocated; (3) strategic reduction of services related to our Targeted Growth Initiative discussed in Executive Overview Significant Challenges Company Specific Volume Challenge above; (4) population trends in Florida; and (5) unfavorable publicity about us, which impacts our relationships with physicians and patients. Our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by 3.7% compared to the prior year. There were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues. The positive factors include: Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts; Favorable net adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances, primarily attributable to Medicare and Medicaid, of $46 million in 2007 compared to $34 million in 2006; and An increase in DSH payments under various states Medicaid programs to $165 million in 2007 from $157 million in 2006. 56 Table of Contents The negative factors include: Lower overall volumes, particularly at our Florida hospitals; and A shift in volume from traditional Medicaid to managed Medicaid plans. Same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 8.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, although overall same hospital outpatient visits decreased 1.7% in 2007. The primary reason for the same hospital net outpatient revenue increase is improved managed care pricing. SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased 0.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately 5.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase is primarily due to merit increases since the prior year and a greater number of employed physicians. Included in salaries, wages and benefits expense in the year ended December 31, 2007 is $40 million of stock based compensation expense compared to $50 million in 2006. The decrease is due to the vesting of higher grant date fair value awards from prior years and the issuance of new awards at lower grant date fair values primarily due to our lower stock price. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006; however, supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased approximately 3.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. This increase in supplies expense reflected higher costs for implants and pacemakers due to inflation and technology improvements, partially offset by lower cardiovascular and pharmaceutical supply costs, which resulted from a decrease in cardiovascular procedures and our efforts to use more cost effective pharmaceuticals. PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues increased 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to higher self pay revenues. The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer: December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts Net AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts Net (In Millions) Medicare $ 163 $ $ 163 $ 151 $ $ 151 Medicaid 134 134 134 134 Cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (15 ) (15 ) (39 ) (39 ) Commercial managed care 531 78 453 518 100 418 Governmental managed care 170 170 149 149 Self pay uninsured 192 152 40 162 142 20 Self pay balance after 129 67 62 123 61 62 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agencies 33 33 36 36 Other 210 67 143 251 78 173 Total continuing operations 1,547 364 1,183 1,485 381 1,104 Total discontinued operations 279 77 202 426 117 309 $ 1,826 $ 441 $ 1,385 $ 1,911 $ 498 $ 1,413 At December 31, 2007, our collection rate on self pay accounts, adjusted for hospitals reclassified to discontinued operations, was approximately 35%, including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors. The comparable self pay collection percentage as of December 31, 2006 for these same 57 Table of Contents hospitals was approximately 31%. Our provision for doubtful accounts in the three months ended December 31, 2007 includes a $16 million favorable adjustment in the estimate of necessary bad debt reserve levels at year end primarily related to uninsured patients billings in 2007 compared to a favorable adjustment of $8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2006. The change in anticipated collections as of December 31, 2007 was based on a look back period of 18 months of collections. At December 31, 2007, our collection rate on managed care accounts, adjusted for hospitals reclassified to discontinued operations, was approximately 98%, including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors. The comparable managed care collection percentage as of December 31, 2006 for these same hospitals was approximately 97%. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our continuing operations net accounts receivable of $1.198 billion and $1.143 billion, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $15 million and $39 million, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively: December 31, 2007 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 96 % 63 % 76 % 34 % 69 % 61 120 days 3 % 25 % 14 % 25 % 16 % 121 180 days 1 % 12 % 5 % 12 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 5 % 29 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % December 31, 2006 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 98 % 61 % 74 % 32 % 68 % 61 120 days 2 % 26 % 16 % 25 % 17 % 121 180 days % 13 % 6 % 12 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 4 % 31 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 52 days at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. AR Days at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were within our target during those periods of less than 60 days. As of December 31, 2007, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $4.5 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house and outside collection agencies or vendors. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts at collection agencies is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. Receivables from patients who were potentially eligible for Medicaid were classified as Medicaid pending, under our MEP, with appropriate contractual allowances recorded. Based on trends as of December 31, 2007, approximately 80% of all accounts in our MEP were ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as Medicaid. The following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our MEP, still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2007 and 2006, by aging category: December 31, 2007 2006 0 60 days $ 59 $ 54 61 120 days 15 19 121 180 days 6 9 Over 180 days(1) Total $ 80 $ 82 (1) Includes accounts receivable of $10 million at December 31, 2007 and $12 million at December 31, 2006 that were fully reserved. 58 Table of Contents OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues were 22.8% and 23.1% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other operating expense per adjusted patient day increased approximately 5.7% in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher physician fees, contracted services and information technology services costs. Also included in other operating expenses is malpractice expense of $163 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $174 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is due primarily to lower patient volume levels, tort reform in several states, and reduced claims experience and ultimate indemnity paid on claims. Also included in other operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2007 is $3 million in net gains compared to $3 million in net losses in the year ended December 31, 2006. The 2007 amount includes an $8 million net gain on the sale of a medical office building in Florida, offset by various immaterial losses on sales of equipment. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $49 million, net of insurance recoveries of $5 million, compared to $318 million, net of insurance recoveries of $3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The primary reason for the decrease is lower impairment charges in 2007. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail of these charges and related liabilities. In the second quarter of 2006, we announced several changes to our operating structure. Because of the restructuring of our regions, our goodwill reporting units (as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) changed in the second quarter of 2006, requiring us to perform a goodwill impairment evaluation. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $35 million during the three months ended June 30, 2006 based on the estimated fair value of goodwill associated with the reconfigured reporting units. In addition, as part of our annual impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $152 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2006 for our former Central Northeast region due to a lower estimated fair value as a result of adverse industry and company specific challenges that continued to affect our operating results and our anticipated future financial trends, including reduced patient volumes, high levels of bad debt expense related to uninsured and underinsured patients, and continued pressure on labor and supply costs. We estimated the fair value of the goodwill based on appraisals, established market values of comparable assets, or internal estimates of future net cash flows. Our impairment tests presume stable or, in some cases, improving results in our hospitals. If these expectations are not met, or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we will incur additional restructuring charges. Future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $13 million compared to $766 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The amount for 2007 includes a $7 million increase in the estimated liabilities for wage and hour actions and other unrelated employment matters further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2006 expenses primarily consisted of legal settlements with the federal government and costs to defend ourselves in various lawsuits. INCOME TAX BENEFIT Income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2007 included: (1) an income tax benefit of $83 million to reduce our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including related interest; and (2) income tax expense of $48 million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and for other tax adjustments. 59 Table of Contents Income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2006 included: (1) a $247 million income tax benefit ($171 million recorded as a current income tax receivable and $76 million as a non current deferred tax asset) to record the tax effects of our global civil settlement with the federal government; (2) the impact of the non deductibility of goodwill impairment charges ($52 million unfavorable tax impact on the effective tax rate reconciliation as a result of this permanent difference); (3) income tax expense of $138 million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, including the impact on the valuation allowance of an IRS Revenue Agents Report (the RAR) discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and (4) an income tax benefit of $40 million to reflect changes in our tax contingency reserves, including interest and including the impact of the RAR and settlement discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH REQUIREMENTS Our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees, are summarized in the table below, all as of December 31, 2008: Years Ending December 31, Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 LaterYears (In Millions) Long term debt(1) $ 7,301 $ 382 $ 382 $ 1,381 $ 899 $ 1,242 $ 3,015 Global civil settlement payable(1) 170 97 73 Capital lease obligations(1) 3 3 Long term non cancelable operating leases 477 114 89 74 62 56 82 Standby letters of credit 196 192 4 Guarantees(2) 129 87 24 6 3 3 6 Asset retirement obligations 154 154 Academic affiliation agreements(3) 319 40 37 32 19 19 172 Tax liabilities 154 36 62 56 Supplemental executive retirement plan obligations 496 18 18 18 18 18 406 Information technology contract services 872 102 105 108 105 108 344 Purchase orders 212 212 Total $ 10,483 $ 1,280 $ 794 $ 1,619 $ 1,106 $ 1,446 $ 4,238 (1) Includes interest through maturity date/lease termination. (2) Includes minimum revenue guarantees, primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals, and operating lease guarantees. (3) These agreements contain various rights and termination provisions. The standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs. The amount of collateral required is principally dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness. The insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers. The standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities, including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations, equipment and information systems additions and replacements, introduction of new medical technologies, design and construction of new hospitals and buildings, and various other capital improvements. Capital expenditures were $547 million, $743 million and $693 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2009 will total approximately $400 million to $450 million, including $59 million that was accrued at December 31, 2008, but not paid until 2009. The anticipated capital expenditures include approximately $9 million in 2009 to meet California seismic requirements for 60 Table of Contents our remaining California facilities after all planned divestitures. We currently estimate spending a total of approximately $147 million to comply with the requirements under Californias seismic regulations. Our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than certain previous estimates because several of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using a new evaluation tool. Our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for inflation. Our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2009 also include approximately $4 million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities, as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit. We expect to spend a total of approximately $120 million on such improvements over the next seven years. We were previously required to complete the same work over the next three years, but negotiated an extension to allow for a more orderly use of cash flow. Interest payments, net of capitalized interest, were $391 million, $395 million and $376 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest payments since 2006 is primarily due to payments related to our 2006 civil settlement with the federal government, as such payments did not begin until the fourth quarter of 2007. We anticipate that our gross interest payments, including capitalized interest, for the year ending December 31, 2009 will be approximately $385 million. However, this amount could increase depending on the success of our recent offer to exchange up to $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes maturing in December 2011 and June 2012 for an equal aggregate principal amount of two new series of senior secured notes maturing in 2015 and 2018 in a private placement. Although the total amount of our long term debt will not change as a result of the exchange offer, the interest rates on the new notes actually issued in connection with the exchange offer will be higher than the interest rates on our existing 2011 and 2012 notes, resulting in increased interest payments for us. Income tax payments, net of tax refunds, were approximately $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to approximately $162 million in income tax refunds during the year ended December 31, 2007. In April 2007, we received a tax refund of approximately $171 million. At December 31, 2008, our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of (1) federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion pretax expiring in 2024 to 2028, (2) approximately $27 million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration, and (3) general business credit carryforwards of approximately $13 million expiring in 2023 to 2028. SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily derived from operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of investments and facilities. Our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable. As we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients grow, our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $208 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $326 million in the year ended December 31, 2007. Key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the 2008 and 2007 periods include the following: Net income tax payments of $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to refunds of $162 million received in 2007; Payments of $97 million ($88 million in principal and $9 million in interest) in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to our 2006 civil settlement with the federal government compared to $39 million ($24 million in principal and $15 million in interest) in 2007, as these payments did not begin until the fourth quarter of 2007; Additional aggregate annual 401(k) matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of $20 million ($116 million in year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $96 million in 2007); Additional cash flows as a result of enhanced management of accounts payable ($80 million) and accounts receivable ($58 million); Insurance recoveries of $60 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to litigation, which was settled in December 2004, involving our former Redding Medical Center; Lower investment earnings in 2008 compared to 2007 of approximately $33 million, excluding $10 million of Redding insurance recoveries (part of the $60 million of Redding recoveries discussed above) classified as investment earnings; A $20 million decline in the cash and cash equivalents balance related to our Medicare HMO insurance subsidiary operating in Louisiana primarily due to the timing of monthly payments from CMS; and 61 Table of Contents Lease termination payments of $9 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 associated with the divestiture of the Tarzana campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center. Excluding the simultaneous purchase and sale of the Tarzana campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center for $89 million, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we received proceeds of $71 million from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations, primarily from the sales of North Ridge Medical Center, the Encino campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center, Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center, and San Dimas Community Hospital. Proceeds from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2007 aggregated $91 million. We also received proceeds, which are classified as investing activities, during the year ended December 31, 2008 of $144 million from the sale of our investment in Broadlane, $25 million from the sale of our interest in a joint venture with a real estate investment trust and $8 million from our investment in Metrocrest Hospital Authority bonds related to previously divested hospitals in the Dallas, Texas area. In 2007, we received proceeds of $31 million from our investment in Metrocrest Hospital Authority bonds (essentially, the source of these proceeds was our final payment of $31 million under our lease agreement with the Authority to operate two hospitals in the Dallas, Texas area) and $82 million from the cash surrender value or basis reduction of certain life insurance policies. In addition, in 2007 we received $6 million of insurance recoveries for hurricane related property damage. Further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet during 2009 could generate incremental cash. These initiatives include the sale of our medical office buildings and excess land, buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets. We are currently working to reach definitive agreements in connection with our previously announced intention to sell up to 31 of our 47 owned medical office buildings. These types of transactions are subject to significant negotiation and due diligence efforts and likely will be delayed as a result of the effects of the current credit environment. The remaining 16 owned medical office buildings are less likely to be sold as we are either a substantial or the primary occupant, or because the buildings are strategically located for our purposes. The realization of any incremental cash as a result of balance sheet initiatives cannot be assured. Capital expenditures were $547 million and $743 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, including $75 million and $67 million, respectively, for construction of a new hospital in El Paso, Texas, which was completed in May 2008, and a replacement hospital in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, which we expect to complete in 2010. We use the fair market value to record our investments that are held for sale. As shown in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs. However, at December 31, 2008, one of our captive insurance subsidiaries held $2 million (principal value) of auction rate securities, classified as investments, whose auctions have failed due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. Due to the illiquidity of these securities for over a year, we recorded an other than temporary impairment of approximately $1 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, we recorded a loss of approximately $1 million related to $49 million of investments in the Reserve Yield Plus Fund and reclassified the balance from cash equivalents as the fund has experienced liquidity issues and temporarily suspended distributions. The fund is currently in the process of liquidating its investments and distributing cash to its investors and, in the three months ended December 31, 2008, we received $34 million of cash distributions from the fund. We expect the fund to liquidate all of its investments; however, the ultimate timing is uncertain. We will continue to closely monitor our investments, but do not anticipate any future decrease in value of either the auction rate securities or the Reserve Yield Plus Fund to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have no other investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the current economic crisis that will materially impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND RELATED COVENANTS We have a five year, $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility that is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of our acute care and specialty hospitals, and bears interest at our option based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 175 basis points or Citigroups base rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus 75 basis points. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision, which we believe is customary in receivables backed credit facilities, that gives our banks the right to require that proceeds of collections of substantially all of our consolidated accounts receivable be applied directly to repay outstanding loans and other amounts that are due and payable under the revolving credit facility at any time that unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is less than $100 million or if an event of default has occurred and is continuing thereunder. In that event, we would seek to re borrow under the revolving credit facility to satisfy our operating cash requirements. Our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to conditions that we believe are customary in such facilities, including that no events of default then exist. 62 Table of Contents In June 2008, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that allows us to grant liens on certain hospital facilities and inventory up to certain dollar limits set forth in the amendment. The amendment also provides us with additional flexibility over the remaining term of the credit agreement to pursue, at our option, various alternatives to refinance our existing unsecured senior debt, if market conditions and other considerations warrant. The alternatives include the issuance of secured debt, preferred stock and convertible debt, as well as other unsecured debt. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants and conditions that have, among other requirements, limitations on (1) liens on principal properties and (2) sale and lease back transactions with respect to principal properties. A principal property is defined in the indentures as a hospital that has an asset value on our books in excess of 5% of our consolidated net tangible assets, as defined. The above limitations do not apply, however, to (1) debt that is secured by assets other than principal properties or (2) debt that is secured by principal properties if the aggregate of such secured debt does not exceed 15% of our consolidated net tangible assets, as further described in the indentures. The indentures also prohibit the consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all assets unless no event of default would result after giving effect to such transaction. All of our senior notes are general unsecured senior debt obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness, but are effectively subordinated to the obligations of our subsidiaries and any obligations under our revolving credit facility to the extent of the collateral. In early 2009, we made an offer to exchange up to $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes maturing in December 2011 and June 2012 for an equal aggregate principal amount of two new series of senior secured notes maturing in 2015 and 2018 in a private placement. As of the filing date of this report, the offer remained open. Any new notes ultimately issued as part of the exchange offer will be guaranteed by and secured by a pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our subsidiaries. Although the total amount of our long term debt will not change as a result of the exchange offer, the interest rates on the new notes actually issued in connection with the exchange offer will be higher than the interest rates on our existing 2011 and 2012 notes, resulting in increased interest expense for us. We may also be required to record a significant net gain in connection with the exchange offer, primarily based on the anticipated fair value of the new notes. From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital markets, bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time. We believe our existing indentures provide significant flexibility for future collateralized borrowings. Although we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes, our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was limited to $444 million at December 31, 2008, based on our eligible receivables and limitations related to our fixed charge coverage ratio under the agreement. At December 31, 2008, there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and we had approximately $196 million of letters of credit outstanding. We also had approximately $507 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2008 to fund our operations and capital expenditures. We generally indemnify our current and former officers and directors from claims and lawsuits related to their actions taken on our behalf during their employment. LIQUIDITY We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand, our investments in the Reserve Yield Plus Fund, marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet, availability under our revolving credit facility, future cash provided by operating activities and anticipated proceeds from the sales of hospitals and other assets held for sale should be adequate to meet our current cash needs. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures, payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs. Long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities, results of balance sheet initiatives previously discussed and, given favorable market conditions, future borrowings or refinancings. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by the deterioration in our results of operations, as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections, which could require us to pursue any number of financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt refinancing, asset sales or other financing alternatives. With the current tightening in the credit markets, the level, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured, and the ability of our counterparties to close asset sales as previously anticipated could also be affected. 63 Table of Contents We are aggressively identifying and implementing further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. Among the areas being addressed are volume growth, managed care payer contracting, procurement efficiencies, cost standardization, bad debt expense reduction initiatives, underperforming hospitals, and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care. Although these initiatives may result in improved performance, that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Excluding the hospitals whose operating results are included in discontinued operations, our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include $1.0 billion, $972 million and $908 million, respectively, of net operating revenues and $79 million, $84 million and $71 million, respectively, of income from operations generated from five general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the respective buildings and the future lease obligations under four of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases. The current terms of these leases expire between 2010 and 2027, not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise. If these leases expire, we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, except for $325 million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of December 31, 2008. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use. In general, we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, given the particular circumstances in which we operate. Actual results may vary from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine, and (3) may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas: Recognition of net operating revenues, including contractual allowances; Provisions for doubtful accounts; Accruals for general and professional liability risks; Accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans; Accruals for litigation losses; Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill; Asset retirement obligations; Accounting for income taxes; and Accounting for stock based compensation. 64 Table of Contents REVENUE RECOGNITION We recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed. Net operating revenues primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates (i.e., gross charges), less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances, principally for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care and other health plans, as well as uninsured patients under the Compact. Revenues under the traditional fee for service Medicare and Medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems. Discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues, which were more prevalent in earlier periods, and certain other payments, such as DSH, GME, IME and bad debt expense, which are based on our hospitals cost reports, are estimated using historical trends and current factors. Cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by Medicare and Medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review, and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved. Because the laws, regulations, instructions and rule interpretations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently, the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts. We have a system and estimation process for recording Medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements. This results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports. For filed cost reports, we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports, and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. Revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers. The payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis. At the end of each month, on an individual hospital basis, we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms. These estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history. Although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill, we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. We do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues. In addition, on a corporate wide basis, we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans. Revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the Compact, whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance. We believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements. We know of no material claims, disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our Consolidated Financial Statements. PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Although outcomes vary, our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients, including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). Generally, as required by EMTALA, patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay. Therefore, services, including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient, are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information. In non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services, it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated. We provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital, our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an 18 month look back period, and other relevant factors. 65 Table of Contents Our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable, including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing. Generally, uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency between 90 to 180 days, once patient responsibility has been identified. When accounts are assigned to the collection agency by the hospital, the accounts are completely written off the hospitals books through the provision for doubtful accounts, and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospitals books at the same time. The estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates. The estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our in house collection agency. Managed care accounts are collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices, whereby the account balances remain in the hospitals patient accounting system and on the hospitals books, and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age. Managed care accounts collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years. Changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts. We continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings. We aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal, including arbitration and litigation, but we may not be successful. ACCRUALS FOR GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY RISKS We accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims, to the extent not covered by insurance, when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We maintain reserves, which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks, including incurred but not reported claims to the extent we do not have insurance coverage. Our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors, including the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, the timing of historical payments, and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments. The liability is adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known. Malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from historical trends. In addition, because of the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. ACCRUALS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS Our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the framework of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement. We evaluate this critical assumption annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover, and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. We decreased our discount rate to 5.75% in 2008 from 6.25% in 2007 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our December 31, 2008 measurement date. The assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for 2009 by $0.5 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 by $26.2 million. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would increase net periodic pension expense for 2009 by $0.4 million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 by $22.1 million. 66 Table of Contents ACCRUALS FOR LITIGATION LOSSES We record reserves for litigation losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). Under SFAS 5, a loss contingency is recorded if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss. If a range of loss can be reasonably estimated, but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. These estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS We evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. We calculate the amount of an impairment if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals, established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. The estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable. They require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates. These assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. We report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell. In such circumstances, our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows. These fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods. Many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates, including the future financial results of our hospitals, how the hospitals are operated in the future, changes in health care industry trends and regulations, and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets. In certain cases, these fair value estimates assume the highest and best use of the assets in the future to a market place participant is other than as a hospital. In these cases, the estimates are based on the fair value of the real property and equipment if utilized other than as a hospital. The impairment recognized does not include the costs of closing the hospital or other future operating costs, which could be substantial. Accordingly, the ultimate net cash realized from the hospital, should we choose to sell it, could be significantly less than its impaired value. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually. For goodwill, we perform the test at the reporting unit level, as defined by appropriate accounting standards, when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually. If we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired, or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value, then we reduce the carrying value, including any allocated goodwill, to fair value. Estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. 67 Table of Contents ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS We recognize the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with asset retirements in the period in which it is incurred, in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation can be made. When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost of the asset retirement obligation by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost associated with the retirement obligation is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, any difference between the cost to settle the asset retirement obligation and the liability recorded is recognized as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The calculation of the asset retirement obligation is a critical accounting estimate because factors used in calculating the obligation can change, which could result in larger or smaller estimated obligations that could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The significant assumptions and estimates used in the calculation include the following: Estimated settlement date of the obligation The year when the asset is no longer deemed to have any future useful life, and the facility or asset is closed, or otherwise disposed of, is when final settlement of the obligation is estimated to occur, and is generally based on the remaining years of useful life of our facilities or the expiration of a lease. Changes in demand, competing facilities, economic conditions, technology advancements, state regulations and availability of physicians, nurses and staff can affect the estimated settlement date. Retirement obligation costs These costs are estimated based on our knowledge of the applicable laws and regulations, known facts and circumstances of specific obligations, and cost estimates obtained from our knowledge and past experience. Asbestos presence The estimated amount of asbestos in our facilities was determined by our construction staff based on their knowledge of the architectural state of the facility, the age of the facility and whether any renovation had recently occurred. Due to facilities changing ownership several times and our experience during renovations of inconsistent use of building materials, it cannot be known with certainty the exact amount of asbestos present or the exact location of all asbestos that may need to be remediated. Inflation rate The inflation rate applied to current remediation costs is used to estimate the future value of the remediation costs at the time the retirement obligation is estimated to be settled. We have assumed an inflation rate of 5% based on the nature of the retirement obligations. Discount rate The estimated costs at the anticipated settlement date are discounted back to the year the asset was built or acquired to determine the amount of the obligation when it was incurred. The estimate of the initial obligation has been accreted to the current date in accordance with SFAS 143. The discount rate represents our credit adjusted, risk free rate of interest, at the time the obligation was originally recorded, which was estimated to be 9.5%. Using these estimates and assumptions, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle, fixed asset cost, accumulated depreciation and the asset retirement obligation were calculated for each of our facilities that have known asset retirement obligations. Subsequent changes to these assumptions will affect future depreciation and accretion expense. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) and FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, as amended by FASB Staff Position No. 48 1 (FIN 48). This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities. 68 Table of Contents Developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. We assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified, we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The main factors that we consider include: Cumulative losses in recent years; Income/losses expected in future years; Unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels; The availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits; The carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities; and Prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions, and such judgments are subject to periodic review. Tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied; (2) the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired. Tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied. While we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities in accordance with SFAS 109 and FIN 48, adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method required by SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees, directors, advisors and consultants generally is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant date and is recognized over the vesting periods of the awards, whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period. Under SFAS 123(R), we estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant, using a binomial lattice model. The key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include: Expected volatility; Expected dividend yield; Expected life; Expected forfeiture rate; Risk free interest rate range; Early exercise threshold; and Early exercise rate. The expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options. The expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options, and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges. The historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 due to unique events occurring during that time, which caused the extreme volatility of our stock price. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. This model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price. The risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon United States Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes. 69 Table of Contents The most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option, because it, in turn, is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates. Accordingly, we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date. Our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of December 31, 2008. The fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. At December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings subject to or with variable interest rates. Maturity Date, Year Ending December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Fair Value (Dollars in millions) Fixed rate long term debt $ 2 $ 2 $ 1,002 $ 602 $ 1,001 $ 2,251 $ 4,860 $ 3,563 Average interest rates 8.7 % 8.7 % 6.7 % 6.7 % 7.7 % 9.4 % 8.2 % We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. At December 31, 2008, we had long term, market sensitive investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries. Our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as non current assets is substantially mitigated by the long term nature and type of the investments in the portfolio. At December 31, 2008, the net accumulated unrealized losses related to our captive insurance companies investment portfolios were approximately $4 million. We have no affiliation with partnerships, trusts or other entities (sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities) whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements by us. Thus, we have no exposure to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risks associated with such entities. 70 Table of Contents
