ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The purpose of this section, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, is to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to better understand our business, to enhance our overall financial disclosures, to provide the context within which our financial information may be analyzed, and to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial and statistical information included herein relates to our continuing operations, with dollar amounts expressed in millions (except per share, per admission, per patient day and per visit amounts). This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. It includes the following sections: Executive Overview Sources of Revenue Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Recently Issued Accounting Standards Critical Accounting Estimates EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We continue to focus on the execution of our operating and financing strategies. While we have seen certain areas of improvement, we are still facing several industry wide and company specific challenges that continue to negatively affect our progress. We are dedicated to improving our patients, shareholders and other stakeholders confidence in us. We believe we will accomplish that by providing quality care and generating positive volume growth and earnings at our hospitals. KEY DEVELOPMENTS Recent key developments include the following: NorthShore Regional Medical Center Lease Not Renewed In January 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain of our owned assets and transition the operation of NorthShore Regional Medical Center in Slidell, Louisiana to a new hospital operator. We had previously announced in May 2009 that we would not renew the lease for this hospital. We anticipate that the transaction will close effective April 1, 2010. Repurchases of Outstanding Senior Notes In December and November 2009, we completed open market repurchases of $3 million aggregate principal amount of our 9 1/4% senior notes due 2015 and $2 million aggregate principal amount of our 63/8% senior notes due 2011 for cash of approximately $5 million. In September 2009, we repurchased approximately $8 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for cash of approximately $8 million. In July 2009, we completed open market repurchases of approximately $68 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 3/8 % senior notes due 2011, our 6 1/2% senior notes due 2012, our 9 7/8 % senior notes due 2014, and our 6 7/8 % senior notes due 2031 for cash of approximately $60 million. As a result of our July note repurchases, we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2009. 25 Table of Contents Interest Rate Swap In November 2009, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement we had entered into effective May 1, 2009 with respect to our 7 3/8 % senior notes due 2013. We realized approximately $8 million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement. For additional information, refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Quality Designations In November 2009, we announced that 42 of our hospitals received 257 quality designations through CIGNA HealthCare. These quality designations are based on outcomes for treatment of 29 surgical procedures and medical conditions. In addition, 26 of our hospitals received 76 Centers of Excellence designations for 2009 from CIGNA. These designations recognize hospitals meeting CIGNAs standards for quality and efficiency. In August 2009, we announced that 29 of our hospitals received 73 UnitedHealth Premium Specialty Center designations for cardiac care, cardiac surgery and heart rhythm disorders. To receive these designations, hospitals must meet or exceed UnitedHealthcares quality criteria based on nationally recognized medical standards. Sale of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Repurchase of Outstanding Senior Notes with Sales Proceeds In September 2009, we sold 345,000 shares of 7% mandatory convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately $334 million. We used $315 million of the net proceeds to repurchase $300 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 91/4% senior notes due 2015 in September 2009. Private Offering of Senior Secured Notes In June 2009, we sold $925 million aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8% senior secured notes due 2019. We will pay interest on the senior secured notes semi annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The senior secured notes rank equally with our 9% senior secured notes due 2015 and 10% senior secured notes due 2018, which we issued in May and March 2009, as described below. All of our senior secured notes are guaranteed by and secured by a first priority pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our subsidiaries. Tender Offer to Purchase Senior Notes In June 2009, we purchased in a cash tender offer approximately $900 million of the $1 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 9 7/8% senior notes due 2014 for total consideration of approximately $941 million, representing approximately $900 million in principal payments and approximately $41 million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase. We purchased the 9 7/8% senior notes with the net proceeds of approximately $881 million from the offering of the 8 7/8% senior secured notes due 2019 and cash on hand. In connection with the purchases of our 97/8% senior notes, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $24 million in the three months ended June 30, 2009. New Joint Venture Created In May 2009, we announced the creation of MED3000 Practice Resources, LLC, a joint venture between MED3000, Inc., an unaffiliated third party, and one of our subsidiaries, which is a 20% minority owner. The new joint venture will initially focus on providing services to physician practices in the 12 states where we currently operate. In addition, the joint venture will provide health information technology (including practice management systems, electronic health records and personal health records) and management services (including revenue cycle management, group purchasing and comprehensive practice and data management). Sale of Peoples Health Network In May 2009, we completed the sale of our 50% membership interest in Peoples Health Network (PHN), the company that administered the operations of Tenet Choices, Inc. (TCI), our wholly owned Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization insurance subsidiary in Louisiana. As part of the transaction, we transferred substantially all of the insurance assets and liabilities of TCI to a PHN subsidiary. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain in continuing operations of approximately $15 million. Note Exchanges In May and March 2009, we exchanged approximately $918 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 3/8% senior notes due 2011 and $510 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 1/2% senior notes due 2012 for approximately $714 million aggregate principal amount of new 9% senior secured notes due 2015 and approximately $714 million aggregate principal amount of new 10% senior secured notes due 2018, plus additional consideration described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sale of USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital On March 31, 2009, we completed the previously disclosed sale of USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital to the University of Southern California. The transaction generated cash proceeds of approximately $275 million from the sale of property and equipment. Approximately $30 million from these proceeds was deferred and placed in an escrow account, where they will remain for up to four years. We retained substantially all of the hospitals working capital, which is expected to result in approximately $30 million of incremental cash proceeds. The total net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 26 Table of Contents National Agreement with Aetna In March 2009, we announced that Tenet Physicians Inc., one of our subsidiaries, had entered into a national agreement with Aetna that covers 400 employed physicians and facilitates the participation of those physicians in Aetnas provider networks. The agreement also includes provisions promoting a joint, collaborative effort to enhance the credentialing process for the employed physicians. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES As stated above, there are a number of significant industry wide and company specific challenges that have been impacting our operating performance, including those summarized below. Volumes Although we have seen some improvements in recent quarters, we have experienced declines in patient volumes over the last several years. We believe the reasons for these declines include, but are not limited to, factors that have affected many hospital companies, including decreases in the demand for invasive cardiac procedures, increased competition and utilization pressure by managed care organizations. Given our geographic concentration, we are also affected by population trends, which have been a particular concern in Florida. In addition, we believe the industry wide challenges associated with physician recruitment, retention and attrition have also been significant contributors to our past volume declines. Our operations depend on the efforts, abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, most of whom have no contractual relationship with us. It is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs. Although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs in each of the last three years, in some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance. Other issues facing physicians, such as proposed decreases in Medicare payments, are forcing them to consider alternatives, including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected. We continue to take steps to increase patient volumes; however, due to the concentration of our hospitals in California, Florida and Texas, we may not be able to mitigate some factors that contribute to volume declines. One of our initiatives is our Physician Relationship Program, which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations. We have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals, which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes. We have also sought to include all of our hospitals and an increased number of our affiliated physicians in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts, which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks. In addition, we have completed clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results. This Targeted Growth Initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations, which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes. However, the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are in higher demand and are more profitable. Our Commitment to Quality initiative is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge. We continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care. As a result of these efforts, our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care. In our continuing efforts to improve our clinical outcomes and drive down our costs of care, we launched our Medicare Performance Initiative in 2009. This initiative is focused on the identification and reduction of costs associated with variations in physician and hospital practices. The project includes the dissemination of best practices based on evidence based medicine, which we expect will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay, as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients. We believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction, potentially improving our volumes. Bad Debt Like other organizations in the health care industry, we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans. The discounting components of our Compact with Uninsured Patients (Compact) have reduced our provision for doubtful accounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, but they do not mitigate the net economic effects of treating uninsured or underinsured patients. We continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts, and we continue to focus, where applicable, on placement of patients in various government programs, such as Medicaid. However, unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses, we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue or increase. 27 Table of Contents Cost Pressures Labor and supply expenses remain significant cost pressures for us as well as the industry in general. Controlling labor costs in an environment of fluctuating patient volumes and increased labor union activity will continue to be a challenge. Also, inflation and technology improvements are driving supply costs higher, and our efforts to control supply costs through product standardization, bulk purchases and improved utilization are constantly challenged. General Economic Conditions We believe the current economic downturn, tight credit markets, and instability in the banking and financial institution industries has had some impact on our volumes and has affected our ability to collect outstanding receivables. A significant amount of our admissions comes through our emergency rooms and, therefore, is not usually materially impacted by broad economic factors. However, our levels of elective procedures and our ability to collect accounts receivable, due to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment, may be materially impacted if the current economic environment continues. We could also be negatively affected if California, Florida or other states reduce funding of Medicaid and other state health care programs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide and company specific challenges, including fluctuating volumes, decreased demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt, that have negatively affected our revenue growth and operating expenses. We believe our future profitability will be achieved through volume growth, appropriate reimbursement levels and cost control across our portfolio of hospitals. We also believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect recent trends we are experiencing with respect to volumes, revenues and expenses; therefore, we have provided below detailed information about these metrics for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. In order to disclose trends using data comparable to the prior year period, operating statistics in this section and throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis are presented on a same hospital basis, where noted, and exclude the results of our Sierra Providence East Medical Center, which opened in May 2008, and NorthShore Regional Medical Center, which was reclassified to discontinued operations in the three months ended June 30, 2009.

(2) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. 28 Table of Contents Total same hospital admissions declined by 1,207, or 0.9%, in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Our California region and our Philadelphia market each reported positive total admissions growth, while our other regions reported admissions declines, in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. Commercial managed care admissions declined by 5.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Admissions through all government programs, including both traditional and managed government programs, achieved positive growth of 0.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. Uninsured and charity admissions grew by 0.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. There were 666 flu related admissions in the three months ended December 31, 2009.

We had growth of 32,551 total same hospital outpatient visits, or 3.5%, in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. All of our regions reported growth in outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2009, with the strongest growth occurring in our Philadelphia market, which achieved double digit growth. The outpatient growth in our Philadelphia market was impacted by an increase in flu related visits at St. Christophers Hospital for Children. In addition, our Central region achieved outpatient visit growth of 5.2%. There were 10,391 flu related outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2009. Newly opened or acquired facilities contributed 967 visits, net of the loss of visits from a center in which our ownership was converted to a minority interest in 2009. Excluding these 967 visits, organic growth in outpatient visits was an increase of 31,584 visits, or 3.4%, in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. 29 Table of Contents Outpatient surgery visits grew by 1.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Outpatient imaging experienced a decline in visits of 1.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. Emergency department outpatient visits increased 30,637 visits, or 9.5%, in the three months ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. This increase in emergency department outpatient visits contributed 94.1% of the increase in total outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Charity and uninsured outpatient visits decreased by 1.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. Same HospitalContinuing Operations Three Months Ended December 31, Revenues 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues $ 2,235 $ 2,160 3.5 % Net patient revenues from commercial managed care $ 892 $ 868 2.8 % Revenues from the uninsured $ 149 $ 148 0.7 % Net inpatient revenues(1) $ 1,468 $ 1,431 2.6 % Net outpatient revenues(1) $ 679 $ 641 5.9 % (1) Net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues. Net inpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $60 million and $63 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net outpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $89 million and $85 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net operating revenues increased approximately $75 million, or 3.5%, on a same hospital basis in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Favorable prior year cost report adjustments contributed approximately $6 million to net operating revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to a contribution of $2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2008. Also, in the three months ended December 31, 2008, net operating revenues included $8 million related to a Medicare medical education reimbursement issue. Excluding prior year cost report adjustments and the $8 million medical education reimbursement revenue from the three months ended December 31, 2008, same hospital net operating revenues would have shown an increase of 3.7% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Commercial managed care revenues increased by 2.8% on a same hospital basis despite the 5.3% decline in commercial managed care admissions and the decline of 3.9% in commercial managed care outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Same HospitalContinuing Operations Three Months Ended December 31, Revenues on a Per Admission, Per Patient Day and Per Visit Basis 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) Net inpatient revenue per admission $ 11,466 $ 11,073 3.5 % Net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 2,358 $ 2,268 4.0 % Net outpatient revenue per visit $ 710 $ 694 2.3 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient admission(1) $ 11,263 $ 10,942 2.9 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient day(1) $ 2,332 $ 2,256 3.4 % Managed care: net inpatient revenue per admission $ 12,364 $ 11,821 4.6 % Managed care: net outpatient revenue per visit $ 832 $ 813 2.3 % (1) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Unit revenue improvement was evident across all key metrics, primarily reflecting the improved terms of our commercial managed care contracts. The growth in net inpatient revenue per admission of 3.5% was adversely impacted by a shift in payer mix, including a decline in commercial managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions to 25.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 26.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2008. The outpatient revenue per visit increase of 2.3% was also constrained by an adverse mix shift, including a decline in commercial managed care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits to 35.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 38.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2008. 30 Table of Contents Same HospitalContinuing Operations Three Months Ended December 31, Selected Operating Expenses 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) Salaries, wages and benefits $ 981 $ 951 3.2 % Supplies 390 382 2.1 % Other operating expenses 474 463 2.4 % Total $ 1,845 $ 1,796 2.7 % Rent/lease expense(1) $ 37 $ 34 8.8 % Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day(2) $ 1,065 $ 1,035 2.9 % Supplies per adjusted patient day(2) 424 416 1.9 % Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day(2) 515 504 2.2 % Total per adjusted patient day $ 2,004 $ 1,955 2.5 % (1) Included in other operating expenses. (2) Adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Total selected operating expenses, which is defined as salaries, wages and benefits, supplies, and other operating expenses, increased by 2.5% on a per adjusted patient day basis in the three months ended December 31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the $16 million discretionary contribution expense for our 401(k) plan discussed below, the percentage increase is 1.6%. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased by approximately 2.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. This increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, increased accruals for annual incentive compensation and our $16 million discretionary contribution to the 401(k) plan accounts of employees who are not eligible for incentive compensation awards, partially offset by reduced contract labor expense and a decline in full time employee headcount. Excluding the discretionary contribution expense for our 401(k) plan, the percentage increase is 1.3% Supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by 1.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. The increase in supplies expense is primarily due to increased utilization of high cost pharmaceuticals and biologics, as well as implantable devices. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by 2.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. The increase is primarily due to higher state provider taxes, increases in costs of contracted services, and a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations. The increase was offset by a $4 million, or 22.2%, decline in total hospital malpractice expense to $14 million in the three months ended December 31, 2009 compared to $18 million in the three months ended December 31, 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to improved claims experience. Same HospitalContinuing Operations Three Months Ended December 31, Provision for Doubtful Accounts 2009 2008 Increase (Decrease) Provision for doubtful accounts $ 176 $ 164 7.3 % Provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues 7.9 % 7.6 % 0.3 %(1) Collection rate on self pay accounts(2) 30.1 % 32.5 % (2.4 )%(1) Collection rate from managed care payers 98.0 % 97.8 % 0.2 %(1) (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2008. (2) Self pay accounts receivable are comprised of both uninsured and balance after insurance receivables. Provision for doubtful accounts increased by $12 million, or 7.3%, in the three months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. The increase in provision for doubtful accounts was related to higher pricing and the 240 basis point decline in our collection rate on self pay accounts. These items were partially offset by a decline in uninsured volumes, improved collection rates from managed care payers and improved managed care accounts receivable aging categories. 31 Table of Contents The self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 30.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2009, compared to 32.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2008. The estimated direct and allocated costs (based on selected operating expenses, which include salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses) of caring for uninsured patients were $93 million for both of the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The table below shows the pretax and after tax impact on continuing operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of the following items: Three Months EndedDecember 31, Years EndedDecember 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 (Expense) Income Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges $ (14 ) $ (12 ) $ (27 ) $ (16 ) Litigation and investigation benefit (costs) (18 ) 4 (31 ) (41 ) Gain from early extinguishment of debt 97 Net gain (loss) on sales of investments (1 ) 15 139 Pretax impact $ (32 ) $ (9 ) 54 $ 82 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance and other tax adjustments $ 33 $ 9 $ 110 $ 56 Total after tax impact $ 12 $ 6 $ 144 $ 109 Diluted per share impact of above items $ 0.03 $ 0.01 $ 0.28 $ 0.22 Diluted earnings (loss) per share, including above items $ 0.03 $ (0.01 ) $ 0.43 $ 0.15 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Cash and cash equivalents were $690 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $41 million from $731 million at September 30, 2009. Significant cash flow items in the three months ended December 31, 2009 included: $21 million we received under our interest rate swap agreement; Cash distributions of $1 million we received related to our investment in the Reserve Yield Plus Fund, which are classified as investing activity cash flows; Capital expenditures of $192 million; $23 million in principal payments classified as operating cash outflows from continuing operations related to our 2006 civil settlement with the federal government; Interest payments of $99 million; and Income tax payments of $58 million, including $60 million in settlement of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit disputes in order to forestall future interest accruals as described in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash provided by operating activities was $425 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $208 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. Key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the 2009 and 2008 periods include the following: Additional interest payments of $48 million, primarily due to monthly interest payments under our interest rate swap agreement, higher interest rate debt issued during the year and interest payments that were accelerated and paid in 2009 as a result of our various long term debt transactions discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; $39 million we received under our interest rate swap agreement; 32 Table of Contents Increased operating income from continuing operations of $243 million, excluding litigation and investigation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, and depreciation and amortization in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008; $81 million in payments related to our 2009 settlement of wage and hour actions; Increased income tax payments of $39 million, including $60 million in settlement of IRS audit disputes as discussed above; $60 million of insurance recoveries received in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to our December 2004 Redding Medical Center litigation settlement (based on the components of the recoveries, $39 million was classified as discontinued operations cash flows from operations and $21 million was classified as continuing operations cash flows from operations); $61 million of additional cash flows related to divested hospitals classified as discontinued operations primarily due to the liquidation of accounts receivable and other working capital balances (such amount excludes the $39 million of insurance recoveries received in 2008 related to Redding Medical Center discussed above); Additional cash flows as a result of enhanced management of account payable ($39 million) and accounts receivable ($70 million); Lease termination payments of $9 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 associated with the divestiture of the Tarzana campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center; Additional aggregate annual 401(k) matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of $7 million ($123 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $116 million in 2008); and Lower cash investment earnings of approximately $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. SOURCES OF REVENUE We receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources, primarily managed care payers and the federal Medicare program, as well as state Medicaid programs, indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients (i.e., patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement). The table below shows the sources of net patient revenues on a same hospital basis, expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources: Years Ended December 31, Net Patient Revenues from: 2009 2008 2007 Medicare 25.1 % 25.5 % 25.9 % Medicaid 8.1 % 8.4 % 8.7 % Managed care governmental 14.7 % 13.3 % 12.0 % Managed care commercial 41.3 % 41.4 % 41.1 % Indemnity, self pay and other 10.8 % 11.4 % 12.3 % Our payer mix on a same hospital admissions basis, expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources, is shown below: Years Ended December 31, Admissions from: 2009 2008 2007 Medicare 30.1 % 30.8 % 31.8 % Medicaid 12.4 % 12.3 % 12.4 % Managed care governmental 22.7 % 21.0 % 18.8 % Managed care commercial 25.7 % 26.8 % 28.0 % Indemnity, self pay and other 9.1 % 9.1 % 9.0 % The increase in managed care governmental admissions is primarily due to a shift from traditional government programs to managed government programs. 33 Table of Contents GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS The Medicare program, the nations largest health insurance program, is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals 65 years of age and older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with end stage renal disease, and is provided without regard to income or assets. Medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources, and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nations poor and most vulnerable individuals. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future, as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced, if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited, or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government health care program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Medicare Medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits. One option, the Original Medicare Plan, is a fee for service payment system. The other option, called Medicare Advantage, includes health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, private fee for service Medicare special needs plans and Medicare medical savings account plans. The major components of our net patient revenues for services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are set forth in the table below: Years Ended December 31, Revenue Descriptions 2009 2008 2007 Diagnosis related group operating $ 1,191 $ 1,170 $ 1,132 Diagnosis related group capital 109 109 111 Outlier 68 66 63 Outpatient 421 378 339 Disproportionate share 219 211 199 Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education(1) 111 110 103 Other(2) 76 92 63 Adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances 10 4 43 Total Medicare net patient revenues $ 2,205 $ 2,140 $ 2,053 (1) Includes Indirect Medical Education (IME) revenue earned by our childrens hospital under the Childrens Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment Program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration of HHS. (2) The other revenue category includes one skilled nursing facility (which we sold in the three months ended June 30, 2009), inpatient psychiatric units, one inpatient rehabilitation hospital (which we closed in the three months ended March 31, 2009), inpatient rehabilitation units, one long term acute care hospital, other revenue adjustments, and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances. A general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan is provided below. Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found under Regulatory and Legislative Changes. Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System Medicare Severity Adjusted Diagnosis Related Group Payments Sections 1886(d) and 1886(g) of the Social Security Act (the Act) set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system (PPS). Under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), Medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge. Discharges are classified according to a system of Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups (MS DRGs), which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources. CMS assigns to each MS DRG a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular MS DRG, relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all MS DRGs. 34 Table of Contents The base payment amount for the operating component of the MS DRG payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share. Both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs, respectively. Using diagnosis and procedure information submitted by the hospital, CMS assigns each discharge to a MS DRG, and the base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the MS DRG assigned. The MS DRG operating and capital base rates, relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually, with consideration given to: the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals; the relative costs associated with each MS DRG; and changes in labor data by geographic area. Although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials, the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospitals operating and capital costs. Outlier Payments Outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals on individual claims for treating Medicare patients whose medical conditions are costlier to treat than those of the average patient in the same MS DRG. To qualify for a cost outlier payment, a hospitals billed charges, adjusted to cost, must exceed the payment rate for the MS DRG by a fixed threshold established annually by CMS. A Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) (formerly known as a Medicare fiscal intermediary) calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospitals most recently filed cost report. Generally, if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the MS DRG payment plus the fixed threshold, the hospital receives 80% of the difference as an outlier payment. Under the Act, CMS must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all prospective payment system (PPS) hospitals to be not less than 5% nor more than 6% of total MS DRG payments (Outlier Percentage). The Outlier Percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of MS DRG and outlier payments. CMS annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit. A change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing: (1) the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments; and (2) the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify for outlier payments. Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients. Disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by CMS and are calculated as a percentage add on to the MS DRG payments. During 2009, 41 of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for DSH payments. The primary method for a hospital to qualify for DSH payments is based on a complex statutory formula that results in a DSH percentage that is applied to payments based on MS DRGs. The hospital specific DSH percentage is equal to the sum of the percentage of Medicare inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for both the Traditional Medicare Plan (Part A) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) percentage, and the percentage of total inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for Medicaid but not Medicare Part A. Hospitals receive interim DSH payments that are reconciled in the annual cost report. CMS develops and distributes the hospital specific SSI percentages, typically one year after the close of the federal fiscal year (FFY); however, the release of the SSI percentages has been delayed in recent years as CMS continues to examine and refine the data. Historically, the SSI percentage included only patient days paid under Part A. In June 2009, CMS released the FFY 2007 SSI percentages, which reflect a policy change to include the Medicare Advantage (Part C) days in the ratio. The 2007 SSI percentages will be used to settle our 2007 cost reports, and we estimate they will have an unfavorable impact on our Medicare net revenue of approximately $9 million. CMS has not released the 2008 and 2009 SSI percentages; however, using the 2007 SSI percentages to approximate the 2008 and 2009 SSI percentages, we estimate they will have an unfavorable impact on our Medicare net revenue for our 2008 and 2009 cost reporting periods through June 30, 2009 of approximately $14 million. Accordingly, we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $23 million ($16 million related to prior years and $7 million related to the current year) in the three months ended June 30, 2009. In 2009, CMS instructed hospitals to submit information related to Part C for FFY 2006 and, according to the CMS website, the 2006 SSI data is under review. While we believe it is likely that CMS will revise the 2006 SSI percentages in the future, we cannot predict what those changes will be or how they might impact our Medicare net revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we learned that CMS had instructed the MACs to suspend the settlement of all cost reports (including ours) in which the 2007 SSI percentages would be used. However, the MACs are authorized to use the 2007 SSI percentages for current DSH interim payments and tentative settlements for post 2007 cost reporting periods pending the release of the 2008 SSI percentages. The cost report settlement suspension is still in effect, and we cannot predict when the suspension will be lifted. The SSI percentage is subject to administrative and judicial review through the cost report appeal process, and we have filed a request for a hearing before the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) on the inclusion of Part C days in the SSI percentage; however, cost report appeals can take many years to resolve. We cannot predict the outcome of our appeal before the PRRB or any action CMS might take with respect to the SSI percentages. Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education The Medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions. This additional reimbursement, which is subject to certain limits, including intern and resident full time equivalent (FTE) limits established in 1996, is made in the form of Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education payments. During 2009, 13 of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments. Medicare rules permit teaching hospitals to enter into Medicare Graduate Medical Education Affiliation Agreements for the purpose of applying the FTE limits on an aggregate basis, and some of our teaching hospitals have entered into such agreements. 35 Table of Contents We were previously contacted by CMS in connection with DGME FTE limits and related reimbursement at Doctors Medical Center in Modesto, California as a result of our 1997 transaction with a county owned hospital in Modesto and the IME and DGME residency program sponsored by the county. We have annually collected approximately $2.5 million of DGME reimbursement at the hospital. We replied to CMS that, based on our analysis of the transaction and the applicable CMS rules, we believe that the DGME FTE limits and related reimbursement reported on the hospitals cost reports were substantially correct. In January 2008, CMS preliminarily advised us that they disagree with our analysis. During the three months ended June 30, 2008, we submitted additional information to CMS regarding the original transaction. CMS subsequently contacted us and stated that: (1) they continue to disagree with our analysis; and (2) they instructed our MAC to reopen settled cost reports to recover IME and DGME payments made to the hospital. During the three months ended September 30, 2008, we submitted additional information for CMS consideration. Also during the three months ended September 30, 2008, we received notices from our MAC of its intent to reopen certain cost reports in connection with this matter. We have since received settlement notices for the hospitals 2001 through 2007 cost reporting periods that reflect a disallowance of all of the hospitals IME and DGME payments, and the hospitals 2008 cost report was filed consistent with the MACs disallowance on the prior year cost reports. Additionally, the MAC ceased making IME and DGME interim payments to the hospital for current and future services. Although we have taken steps necessary to protect our rights to formally challenge CMS decision to disallow the IME and DGME funding for prior periods, it could take several years to resolve this issue and the outcome is uncertain at this time. As a result, in the three months ended June 30, 2008, we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $17 million ($16 million related to 2007 and prior years and $1 million related to the year ended December 31, 2008), and we have not subsequently recorded any IME or DGME revenue for this hospital. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, Stanislaus County confirmed its obligation with respect to a residency program funding grant agreement between Doctors Medical Center and the county; as a result, we recorded an $8 million receivable for that additional grant funding, which we received during 2009. CMS recently revised certain of its policies regarding the eligibility of teaching programs for Medicare IME and DGME reimbursement. In January 2010, the program sponsored by the county, Doctors Medical Center and other hospitals obtained accreditation and other approvals effective for the academic year beginning July 1, 2010 for a residency program that we believe will satisfy CMS requirements for reimbursement. However, the aforementioned CMS policy changes are not retroactive. Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Under the outpatient prospective payment system, hospital outpatient services, except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule, are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (APCs). Services in each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require, and a payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, hospitals may be paid for more than one APC for an encounter. CMS periodically updates the APCs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each APC. Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System The inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system (IPF PPS) applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system. The IPF PPS is based on prospectively determined per diem rates and includes an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases. Inpatient Rehabilitation Prospective Payment System Rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by CMS are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) under the IRF prospective payment system (IRF PPS). Payments under the IRF PPS are made on a per discharge basis. A patient classification system is used to assign patients in IRFs into case mix groups. The IRF PPS uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups. To be paid under the IRF PPS, each hospital or unit must demonstrate on an annual basis that at least 60% of its total population had either a principal or secondary diagnosis that fell within one or more of the qualifying conditions designated in the Medicare regulations governing IRFs. As of December 31, 2009, all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required 60% threshold. 36 Table of Contents Cost Reports The final determination of certain Medicare payments to our hospitals, such as DSH, DGME, IME and bad debt expense, are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports. The final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal, and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. For filed cost reports, we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. Medicaid Medicaid programs and the corresponding reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year. Estimated payments under various state Medicaid programs, excluding state funded managed care Medicaid programs, constituted approximately 8.1%, 8.4% and 8.7% of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also receive DSH payments under various state Medicaid programs. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our revenue attributable to DSH payments and other state funded subsidy payments was approximately $171 million, $153 million and $162 million, respectively. Medicaid patient revenues of our continuing general hospitals by state for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are set forth in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Florida $ 182 $ 167 California 125 133 Missouri 75 73 Georgia 73 83 Texas 67 52 Pennsylvania 53 56 South Carolina 52 49 North Carolina 27 25 Nebraska 23 25 Alabama 14 23 Tennessee 9 8 $ 700 $ 694 Several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Most states began a new fiscal year on July 1, and although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets, some states may face mid year budget gaps and many are already projecting shortfalls for state fiscal year 2011, which could result in additional reductions to Medicaid payments, coverage and eligibility or additional taxes on hospitals. Other states have proposed or enacted measures that are designed to preserve or restore Medicaid funding. Provided below is information regarding recent significant state proposals and actions that are likely to affect our hospitals. California The State of California has taken numerous actions over the past year to address severe budget shortfalls, including actions that affect revenues for our hospitals in the state. On February 20, 2009, a new budget plan for California was released to address budget deficits in the 2008 2009 state fiscal year, as well as the new state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. The new plan included eliminating some benefits and further reductions in coverage. Legal challenges to these reductions have been filed, and temporary injunctive relief on certain elements of the reductions was granted in March 2009. We cannot predict the final outcome of the litigation or the impact it might have on our results of operations, net revenues or cash flows. Additional cuts to the February 2009 budget, including approximately $2 billion in cuts to health programs allocated between disproportionate share hospitals, the Distressed Hospital Fund, hospital based skilled nursing facilities and other areas, were approved July 28, 2009. The budget agreement approved in July 2009 also included substantial cuts to funding for prison health care, which would have an estimated annual impact on revenues of certain of our California hospitals of approximately $17 million. 37 Table of Contents According to recent state estimates, California faces a combined fiscal year 2009 2010 and fiscal year 2010 2011 deficit of approximately $20 billion. To address this shortfall, in January 2010, the Governor of California proposed nearly $3 billion in cuts to health and human services programs, including a plan to reduce Medi Cal spending by limiting services, implementing an additional delay of payments to providers, eliminating Medi Cal coverage for certain immigrants and cutting other areas of the program. Further savings are proposed that could result in a $64 million reduction in the Healthy Families program and an $811 million reduction in funding for prison health care. The proposed cuts require legislative action and some may require approval by CMS. We cannot predict the final outcome of the proposed reductions or the impact it might have on our results of operations, net revenues or cash flows. Separately, in October 2009, the Governor of California signed legislation supported by the hospital industry to impose an annual provider fee on general acute care hospitals that, combined with federal matching funds, will be used to provide supplemental Medi Cal payments to hospitals, as well as provide the state with $320 million annually for childrens health care coverage. The provider supplemental payment plan created by this legislation proposes to provide these payments for up to 21 months retroactive to April 2009 and expiring on December 31, 2010. The state has submitted the plan to CMS for a required review and approval process and is awaiting a final determination. Based on modeling prepared as part of the legislative process, we estimate that, if the legislation is implemented as approved by the state, revenues, net of provider taxes, for our California hospitals could increase by approximately $106 million for the full 21 month period of the plan. Legislation to extend the supplemental payment plan has been introduced and, if approved, would allow the state to extend the provider fee for the length of any Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage (FMAP) extension passed by Congress. We are unable to predict what action the State of California or CMS might take with respect to the provider fees and, because of the uncertainty regarding the final implementation and administration of the legislation, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the estimated impact. Florida Floridas legislature held a special session in January 2009 to address that states mid year budget deficit and proposed several changes for consideration in the full legislative session that commenced February 1, 2009. The changes passed in the special session resulted in a 4% across the board reduction in Medicaid rates effective March 1, 2009. The impact of these changes on our Florida hospitals revenues was a reduction of approximately $5 million in 2009. The fiscal year 2010 budget adopted in May 2009 did not include additional reductions to Medicaid hospital payments. Recently, the Governor of Florida issued a proposed budget for the state fiscal year 2010 2011 that includes a request for an additional $2.7 billion in Medicaid funding to cover costs associated with increased enrollment and utilization of Medicaid health care services. We cannot predict what action the legislature will take with regard to Medicaid funding in its final budget. In January 2010, CMS approved an amendment to an existing state Medicaid waiver that preserves $300 million in federal funding tied to the Low Income Pool program. We estimate that, without approval of this amendment, Low Income Pool payments to our hospitals would have been reduced by as much as $5 million in 2010. Georgia The Indigent Care Trust Fund (ICTF), or DSH program, for private hospitals is funded with state funds that are subject to an annual legislative appropriation. In 2009, we received approximately $8 million in ICTF funds. The availability and amount of future ICTF funds for our hospitals is not guaranteed. As in past years, the fiscal year 2010 2011 budget submitted by the Georgia Department of Community Health provided funding for private hospitals, for which some, but not all, of our Georgia hospitals would be eligible. Also, as in past years, the state legislature is considering extending eligibility for ICTF funds to additional private hospitals. We cannot predict what action the Georgia legislature might take with regard to this legislation. The Governors recent fiscal year 2010 2011 budget request includes a proposed provider tax on hospitals of 1.6% of net patient revenues and a managed care provider fee of 1.6% of premium revenues to balance the states Medicaid budget. In the absence of these fees, the Department of Community Health estimates it will need to reduce Medicaid provider payments by 16.5%. We cannot predict what action the Governor or the legislature might take with regard to the implementation of a provider tax or cuts to Medicaid provider payments. Missouri The Governor of Missouri is proposing $253 million in general revenue reductions for the state fiscal year 2010 2011, including $121 million to be cut from the states Medicaid program. Proposed reductions include cuts to the outpatient reimbursement methodology, placing a ceiling on inpatient unit costs for hospitals contracting with managed care plans, and re pricing of services for dual eligible individuals. Additionally, pending legislation would trade the states current income tax for a tax on goods and services (including health care) of approximately 6%. If passed by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, this proposal would also require approval by voters in November 2010. We cannot predict what action the Governor or the legislature might take with regard to the implementation of tax changes or cuts to Medicaid provider payments in Missouri. 38 Table of Contents Pennsylvania In October 2009, the Pennsylvania legislature passed and the Governor approved a commonwealth fiscal year 2009 2010 budget that cut $1.45 billion in spending compared to the previous fiscal year. Hospital Medicaid supplemental payments were cut an aggregate 11%. We estimate that these cuts will reduce our payments from Pennsylvania by approximately $4 million in the commonwealths fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. In January 2010, the commonwealth announced that revenues for the fiscal year were running $120 million below estimates, leading to a projected fiscal year 2009 2010 budget gap of $500 million to $1 billion. As a result, the Governor has proposed additional cuts to inpatient and outpatient DSH payments, medical education and certain supplemental payments. Based on limited details available at this time, we are unable to estimate the impact of the proposed reductions on the revenues of our hospitals in Pennsylvania. In addition, the commonwealth has indicated its intention to delay certain payments to providers. North Carolina The North Carolina legislature enacted a $76 million Medicaid reduction in provider rates effective October 1, 2009. This resulted in a 6.3% reduction of inpatient Medicaid rates to hospitals. Hospital outpatient rates were exempted from the cuts. We estimate that the aforementioned 6.3% reduction will reduce our annual Medicaid net revenues in North Carolina by approximately $1 million. Tennessee It is anticipated that the 9% reductions the TennCare Bureau outlined over the past several months will be included in the Governors budget recommendations. These cuts would reduce projected state payments to hospitals by $230 million and would include an annual $10,000 cap on inpatient hospital reimbursement and a limit of eight non emergency hospital outpatient procedures per year for non pregnant adults, as well as a reimbursement ceiling for hospitals at 100% of Medicare rates. These changes are in addition to the fiscal year 2009 2010 cuts scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2010 that are projected to reduce state hospital payments by $296 million and would reduce our annual Medicaid net revenues in Tennessee by approximately $4 million. Approval by CMS will be required for some of the cuts to be implemented. Recently, the member hospitals of the Tennessee Hospital Association voted to support the creation of a provider tax as an alternative to the proposed cuts. This proposal, which would require approval by CMS, could mitigate most, if not all, of the proposed and scheduled reductions. We cannot predict what action the state or CMS might take with respect to the proposed reductions or provider tax. Texas To address a projected budget shortfall in Texas of approximately $11 billion, the Governor and legislative leaders recently mandated that each agency submit plans for achieving a 5% reduction in state spending. In February 2010, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission presented options for achieving $304 million in savings from state health programs, including a 1% rate reduction for Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program providers, a $13 million reduction applied to provider rates under Medicaid managed care plans, and a $10 million reduction in emergency services and trauma funds allocated for hospitals to cover indigent care. Legislative approval is not required and some, if not all, of the recommendations could be implemented effective September 1, 2010. We cannot estimate at this time which proposals might be implemented or the impact on our results of operations, net revenues or cash flows. Pressures on state budgets are expected to continue in the future. The increased FMAP adopted by Congress in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) will expire at the end of December 2010. In addition, health care reform legislation, if enacted, will likely include an expansion of Medicaid eligibility. We cannot predict what action Congress might take to extend the increased FMAP or expand Medicaid eligibility or the impact those actions might have on state budgets or Medicaid payments to our hospitals. Moratorium on Medicaid Regulations In May 2007, CMS issued a final rule, Medicaid Program; Cost Limit for Providers Operated by Units of Government and Provisions to Ensure the Integrity of the Federal State Financial Partnership, that places limits and restrictions on Medicaid reimbursement to safety net hospitals. A one year moratorium on implementation of the final rule was included in the FFY 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Act, which meant that the rule could not take effect before May 25, 2008. On May 21, 2008, CMS announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional 60 days; then in June 2008 the moratorium was extended through March 31, 2009 as part of the FFY 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act. 39 Table of Contents Also in May 2007, CMS issued a proposed rule clarifying that the agency would no longer provide federal Medicaid matching funds for graduate medical education purposes; however, the FFY 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Act contained language that placed a one year moratorium on any such restriction. The moratorium was scheduled to expire on May 23, 2008. On May 21, 2008, CMS announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional 60 days; then in June 2008 the moratorium was extended through March 31, 2009 as part of the FFY 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act. Annual Medicaid graduate medical education payments to our hospitals are approximately $35 million. The ARRA did not extend the moratoria on these regulations; however, it did note that Congress believes that the Secretary of HHS should not promulgate the proposed regulations relating to cost limits on public providers and Medicaid graduate medical education payments as final. CMS has not taken further action on these rules, and we cannot predict what further action, if any, Congress or CMS will take on these issues. Regulatory and Legislative Changes Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems are provided below. Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System Under Medicare law, CMS is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system. The updates generally become effective October 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. On July 31, 2009, CMS issued the Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and Fiscal Year 2010 Rates (Final Rule). The Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: A market basket increase currently estimated at 2.1% for MS DRG operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data (hospitals that do not report specified quality measure data would receive an increase of 0.1%); An increase in the cost outlier threshold from $20,045 to $23,140; A reduction of 0.5% for projected outlier payments and the expiration of Section 508 hospital wage area reclassifications; A 1.4% increase in the capital federal MS DRG rate; and Restoration of 100% of capital IME payments for teaching hospitals. The Transitional Medical Assistance, Abstinence Education, and Qualifying Individuals Programs Extension Act of 2007 (TMA Act) specifies that, to the extent the documentation and coding adjustments applied in FFY 2008 and FFY 2009 result in overpayments relative to the actual amount of documentation and coding related increases in connection with the transition to the MS DRG system from the prior classification system, CMS shall correct the overpayments and underpayments in FFYs 2010 2012. In the Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and FFY 2010 Rates (Proposed Rule) issued on May 1, 2009, CMS estimated the adjustments required to recover estimated coding and documentation overpayments made in FFYs 2008 and 2009 and prevent future coding and documentation overpayments required under the TMA Act to be 5.2% and 3.3%, respectively. Also in the Proposed Rule, CMS proposed to reduce FFY 2010 rates by 1.9%, the adjustment required to remove the FFY 2008 estimated overpayment from the current rates in order to prevent future coding and documentation overpayments related to FFY 2008 rates. In the Final Rule, CMS confirmed its earlier estimates of the aforementioned adjustments required under the TMA Act; however, instead of imposing the 1.9% reduction to FFY 2010 rates as proposed, in the Final Rule CMS stated its intent not to impose any coding and documentation adjustments to the FFY 2010 IPPS rates pending its complete review of the FFY 2008 and 2009 data. Also in the Final Rule, CMS stated that it will defer the recovery of the FFY 2008 and 2009 estimated coding and documentation adjustments and consider phasing in future coding and documentation adjustments over an extended period beginning in FFY 2011 as permitted under the TMA Act. Refer to MedPAC 2011 Recommendations below for additional information regarding the coding and documentation adjustments. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes included in the Final Rule will yield an average 1.7% increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas (populations over 1 million). Using the impact percentages in the Final Rule as applied to our Medicare IPPS payments for the 12 months ended September 30, 2009, the estimated annual impact for all changes in the Final Rule on our hospitals is an increase in our Medicare inpatient revenues of approximately $23 million. Because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future IPPS payments by individual hospital, including admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. 40 Table of Contents Payment Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System On April 30, 2009, CMS issued a Notice of the Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System Update for the rate year beginning July 1, 2009 (IPF PPS Notice). The IPF PPS Notice includes the following payment changes: An update to the IPF payment equal to the market basket of 2.1%; and An increase in the fixed dollar loss threshold amount for outlier payments from $6,113 to $6,565. At December 31, 2009, 14 of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient psychiatric units. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment changes will yield an average 2.0% increase in payments for all IPFs (including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals), and an average 1.8% increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas. Using the urban psychiatric unit impact percentage as applied to our Medicare IPF payments for the 12 months ended June 30, 2009, the annual impact of the payment changes included in the IPF PPS Notice on our psychiatric units may result in an estimated increase in our Medicare revenues of approximately $1 million. Because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future IPF payments, including future legislation, admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes. Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System On July 31, 2009, CMS issued the Final Rule for the Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System for FFY 2010 (IRF PPS Final Rule). The IRF PPS Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes, which, except as noted, were effective for discharges on or after October 1, 2009: A market basket update to the IRF PPS payment rate equal to 2.5%; An increase in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from $10,250 to $10,652; An update to the case mix group relative weights and average length of stay values using FFY 2008 data; and A new regulatory framework that clarifies the coverage criteria (including provisions regarding patient selection and care) that became effective January 1, 2010. At December 31, 2009, 10 of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient rehabilitation units. CMS projects that the payment and policy changes in the IRF PPS Final Rule will result in an estimated total increase in aggregate IRF payments of $145 million or 2.5% of total IRF PPS payments. This estimated increase includes an average 2.5% increase for rehabilitation units in urban areas for FFY 2010. Using the urban rehabilitation unit impact percentage as applied to our Medicare IRF payments for the 12 months ended September 30, 2009, the annual impact of all payment and policy changes in the IRF PPS Final Rule on our rehabilitation units may result in an estimated increase in our Medicare revenues of approximately $1 million. Because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future IRF payments, including legislative action, admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, and the impact of compliance with the IRF admission criteria, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes. Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System On October 30, 2009, CMS issued the Changes to the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and Calendar Year (CY) 2010 Payment Rates (OPPS Rule). The OPPS Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: An update to OPPS payments equal to the estimated market basket of 2.1%; hospitals that did not take part in the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program (HOP QDRP) or that did not successfully report their quality measures will have their update reduced by two percentage points; The continuing requirement that hospitals taking part in the HOP QDRP report seven existing chart abstracted emergency department and perioperative measures, along with four claims based imaging efficiency measures for payment determination for CY 2011 payments; and 41 Table of Contents The implementation of provisions of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 that extend Medicare coverage to important rehabilitative and educational services intended to improve the health of patients diagnosed with certain respiratory, cardiac and renal diseases. Beginning January 1, 2010, hospitals are able to bill Medicare for new pulmonary and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services furnished in hospital outpatient departments to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the OPPS Rule will yield an average 1.9% increase in payments for all hospitals and an average 2.1% increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas (populations over 1 million). According to CMS estimates, the projected annual impact of the payment and policy changes in the OPPS Rule on our hospitals is $8 million, an increase of approximately 2.3% over projected CY 2009 OPPS payments. Because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future OPPS payments, including volumes, case mix and additional costs associated with the physician supervision requirements described below, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. In the preamble to the Medicare CY 2009 OPPS final rule, CMS provided a restatement and clarification of its requirements originally set forth in the April 2000 OPPS final rule for physician supervision of therapeutic services provided to Medicare patients in a hospital setting. In the OPPS Rule, CMS made several important changes to its outpatient physician supervision policy including the following: In CY 2010, CMS will allow certain nonphysician practitioners specifically physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives and licensed clinical social workers to provide direct supervision for all hospital outpatient therapeutic services that they are authorized to personally perform according to their state scope of practice rules and hospital granted privileges. Under prior policy, generally only physicians could provide the direct supervision of these services. For purposes of on campus hospital outpatient therapeutic services, CMS is defining direct supervision to mean that the physician or nonphysician practitioner must be present anywhere on the hospital campus and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure. For services furnished in an off campus provider based department, direct supervision would continue to mean that the physician or nonphysician practitioner must be present in the off campus provider based department and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure. CMS also will require that all hospital outpatient diagnostic services furnished directly or under arrangement, whether provided in the hospital, in a provider based department or at a non hospital location, follow the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule physician supervision requirements for individual tests. We have completed our evaluation of our provider based on campus and off campus outpatient departments to address the physician supervision requirements set forth in the OPPS Rule. Changes were made in a small number of off campus departments to meet the new requirements, including location changes and new contracts for required physician coverage. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. In the OPPS Rule, CMS has indicated that in the case of outpatient therapeutic services furnished on a hospitals campus from 2000 through 2008, CMS will exercise its discretion and decline to enforce in situations involving claims where a hospitals noncompliance with CMS direct physician supervision policy resulted from error or mistake. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 On February 17, 2009, the President signed the ARRA into law. The ARRA includes $31 billion in new spending on health information technology (HIT), most of which is for incentive Medicare and Medicaid payments to physicians and hospitals. The legislation requires that hospitals and physicians become meaningful users of electronic health records (EHR) and submit quality data as a condition of receiving the incentive payments beginning in 2011. If we are able to achieve full compliance at all of our hospitals by 2013, we could receive approximately $350 million in total estimated combined Medicare and Medicaid hospital incentive payments. However, based on the timeframe we anticipate it will take for us to achieve full compliance with the HIT requirements, it is unlikely that we will be able to realize the maximum amount of incentive payments of $350 million. We will be required to make investments in HIT through 2014 of approximately $620 million ($60 million of which has already been incurred) compared to approximately $320 million of Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments that we will likely be able to begin recognizing no later than 2012 based on our anticipated HIT implementation timeframe. The Medicare incentive payments to individual hospitals would be made over a four year, front weighted transition period. The Medicaid incentive payments, although 100% federally funded, will be administered by the states and are subject to more flexible payment and compliance standards. Hospitals that achieve compliance between 2014 and 2015 will receive reduced incentive payments during the transition period. We anticipate that, in addition to the expenditures we will incur to qualify for these incentive payments, our operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of these information system investments. Much or all of these expenditures may have been made by us as a part of our clinical systems enhancements, but would not have been incurred in the timeline to comply with the incentive payment requirements of the ARRA. However, we anticipate there will be other operational benefits that we can realize as a result of these HIT enhancements that are not included in the above amounts. Hospitals that fail to become meaningful users of EHR or fail to submit quality data by 2015 will be subject to penalties in the form of a reduction to Medicare payments. This reduction, which will be based on the market basket update, will be phased in over three years and will continue until a hospital achieves compliance. Using an estimated market basket of 2% and our annual Medicare inpatient net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, should all of our hospitals fail to become meaningful users of EHR and fail to submit quality data, the penalties would result in reductions to our annual Medicare traditional inpatient net revenues of approximately $15 million, $23 million and $30 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017 and subsequent years, respectively. 42 Table of Contents On December 30, 2009, CMS released a proposed rule defining the meaningful use of EHR and describing the provisions of the incentive programs that encourage the adoption and use of EHRs. A related interim final rule also issued on December 30, 2009 by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT sets initial standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for EHR technology. Both rules are open to public comment for 60 days from the date of issuance. The interim final rule for EHR certification will take effect 30 days after publication. We are currently evaluating what changes will be required to our information systems, the cost of those changes, and the time and resources required in order for our hospitals to become meaningful users of HIT. The complexity of the changes required to our hospitals systems and the time required to complete the changes will likely result in some or all of our hospitals not being fully compliant in time to be eligible for the maximum HIT funding permitted under the ARRA. Because of the uncertainties regarding the implementation of HIT, including CMS future implementation regulations, the ability of our hospitals to achieve compliance and the associated costs, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the aforementioned estimates. Medicare Payments to Physicians In the final rule updating the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for CY 2010, CMS adopted an update of negative 21.2% that was scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2010. MPFS rates are updated annually based on a formula that includes the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula. The SGR formula has resulted in negative updates since 2002; however, CMS has taken action or Congress has enacted legislation each year to avoid the negative updates. On December 21, 2009, the President signed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 into law. Among other things, that act delays the scheduled 21.2% Medicare payment reduction for physician services until March 1, 2010. Congress is now considering several proposals to delay the payment cut further, as well as proposals that would replace the sustainable growth rate formula with another methodology for setting Medicare physician payment rates. We cannot predict what actions, if any, Congress or CMS may take with respect to the MPFS update. Refer to MedPAC 2011 Recommendations below for additional information regarding the MPFS update. Health Care Reform On November 7, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed The Affordable Health Care for America Act and, on December 24, 2009, the U.S. Senate passed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, both of which would make significant changes to the U.S. health care system by requiring most individuals to have health insurance coverage. To fund the expansion of insurance coverage, both bills contain measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency in health care delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the Medicare program. In addition to proposals relating to Medicare Advantage payments, bundling acute and post acute care, readmissions and value based purchasing, Congress is considering: Negative adjustments to the annual market basket updates for Medicare inpatient, outpatient, long term acute hospital and inpatient rehabilitation payment systems; Reductions to Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments; and Adjustments to address variations in Medicare reimbursements among geographic regions and individual providers. To reduce the number of uninsured Americans, Congress is also considering expanding Medicaid eligibility to additional populations and creating a new insurance exchange. On February 22, 2010, the President outlined a proposal to bridge the gap between the aforementioned House and Senate bills. The Presidents proposal includes the following provisions: Improving insurance protections for consumers and creating a new federal authority to provide assistance and oversight to the states in monitoring and potentially denying unreasonable rate increases and other unfair practices of insurance companies; Requiring most Americans to carry health insurance coverage, with federal subsidies to help many afford the premiums (insurance companies would be barred from denying coverage to people with medical problems or charging them more); Strengthening the provisions to fight fraud, waste and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid; Increasing the threshold for the excise tax on the most expensive health plans from $23,000 for a family plan to $27,500 and starting the excise tax in 2018 for all plans; and Eliminating the favorable Nebraska FMAP provision in the Senate bill and providing additional funding to all states for the expansion of Medicaid. We are unable to predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to final legislation affecting health care or the impact such legislation might have on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows. 43 Table of Contents FFY 2011 Budget Proposal On February 1, 2010, the President released a $3.8 trillion FFY 2011 budget proposal. The budget request assumes enactment of health care reform legislation, but does not propose additional cuts to Medicare and Medicaid hospital payments for FFY 2011. The key provisions of the budget proposal affecting hospitals include: An extension of the FMAP increase contained in the ARRA for an additional six months through June 30, 2011; An extension of the period during which an individual may qualify for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act premium assistance provided in the ARRA through December 31, 2010; A proposal to allocate $371 billion over 10 years to eliminate the sustainable growth rate cut and freeze Medicare physician payments; and A $250 million increase in discretionary funding for federal Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities. Legislation to approve these proposals must be enacted by Congress for them to become effective. We cannot predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to such legislation or the impact the legislation might have on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows. The budget proposal also states that the President intends to create a bipartisan commission to make recommendations for balancing the federal budget and reducing the deficit starting in 2015. Those recommendations could include cuts to Medicare and Medicaid spending. We cannot predict at this time what recommendations might be made by such a commission or the potential impact of those recommendations on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows. Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Initiative Section 306 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 directed the Secretary of HHS to demonstrate the use of RACs under CMS Medicare Integrity Program in identifying underpayments and overpayments under the Medicare program, and recouping those overpayments. RACs are third party organizations under contract with CMS, and the law provides that compensation paid to each RAC be based on a percentage of overpayment recoveries identified by the RAC. The RAC demonstration was slated to end in March 2008; however, Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) made the RAC program permanent and instructed CMS to use RACs to identify Medicare underpayments and overpayments by 2010. The TRHCA also included several provisions that give Medicare providers certain protections and rights. For example, overpayments identified by the RACs are subject to reconsideration and appeal through several forums. We intend to pursue the reversal of adverse determinations where appropriate; however, we cannot predict the outcome of any such appeals. In addition to any overpayments identified by the RACs that are not reversed, we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials. We have established protocols to respond to RAC requests and payment denials, if any. Several of our hospitals recently received RAC requests and are in the process of responding to those requests. We cannot predict the impact of the RAC reviews on our results of operations or cash flows at this time. MedPAC 2011 Recommendations The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent Congressional agency established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. The MedPACs statutory mandate is quite broad; in addition to advising Congress on payments to private health plans participating in Medicare Advantage and providers in the Original Medicare Plan, MedPAC is also tasked with analyzing access to care, quality of care and other issues affecting Medicare. On January 14, 2010, MedPAC voted on final recommendations for their March 2010 Report to Congress. Recommendations affecting Medicare payments include the following: Congress should increase payment rates for the acute inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems in 2011 by the projected rate of increase in the hospital market basket index, concurrent with implementation of a quality incentive payment program. To restore budget neutrality, Congress should require the Secretary of HHS to fully offset increases in inpatient payments due to hospitals documentation and coding improvements. To accomplish this, HHS must reduce payment rates in the inpatient prospective payment system by the same percentage (not to exceed 2%) each year in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The lower rates would remain in place until overpayments are fully recovered. 44 Table of Contents The update to the payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation services should be eliminated for FFY 2011. Congress should update payments for physician services in 2011 by 1.0%. PRIVATE INSURANCE Managed Care We currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). HMOs generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician, hospital, pharmacy and ancillary service providers that HMO members must access through an assigned primary care physician. The members care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the HMOs quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner. HMOs typically provide reduced benefits or reimbursement to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care or none at all. PPOs generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers. PPO members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit, typically in the form of lower co payments, co insurance or deductibles. As employers and employees have demanded more choice, managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both HMO and PPO plans. The amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $4.9 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. Approximately 62% of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 was derived from our top ten managed care payers. National payers generate approximately 44% of our total net managed care revenues. The remainder comes from regional or local payers. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 57% and 55%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers. Revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers. The payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis. At the end of each month, on an individual hospital basis, we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans. A 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would impact the estimated reserves by $8 million. Some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include: (1) changes in reimbursement levels for procedures, supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered; (2) changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached; (3) changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing; (4) final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels; (5) secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments; and (6) reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels. Contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms, as well as payment history. Although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill, we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. We do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues. In addition, on a corporate wide basis, we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans. We expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term. However, the managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans, which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend. Although we have had eighteen consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing, we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in the future. In the year ended December 31, 2009, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately 58% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. 45 Table of Contents The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are currently considering legislation that would make significant changes to the U.S. health care system, including changes designed to expand insurance coverage to many of the estimated 47 million Americans who are uninsured. Proposals include a mandate on individuals to purchase insurance, a mandate on businesses to provide insurance or pay into a government insurance fund, and income based subsidies for individuals and families to purchase private or public insurance coverage through a government run health insurance exchange. The legislation as proposed would also establish new criteria for health insurance coverage in the individual and small group markets, including guaranteed issue and renewal requirements, restrictions on premium rating and rescissions, and limits on beneficiary cost sharing and annual and lifetime benefit caps. As part of reform legislation, Congress is also considering the Presidents proposal to cut as much as $176 billion over ten years from payments to Medicare Advantage health plans, and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost insurance plans or insurance companies directly. We are unable to predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to final legislation or the impact such legislation ultimately might have on our managed care business. Indemnity An indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient, subject to an increasing number of policy conditions and exclusions. Unlike an HMO member, a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers. SELF PAY PATIENTS Self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and who do not have some form of private insurance and, therefore, are responsible for their own medical bills. A significant portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment that is more costly to provide and, therefore, results in higher billings, which are the least collectible of all accounts. We believe our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors, including increased unemployment rates, reductions in state Medicaid budgets, increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance, and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers. Self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 7% and 8%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients. Further, a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients, as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. We have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts, as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance, that we deem highly collectible. We are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. Over the longer term, several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge. For example, our Compact is designed to offer managed care style discounts to most uninsured patients, which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges. A significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts. Under the Compact, the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance, which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded. The uninsured patient accounts, net of contractual allowances recorded, are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process. The estimated costs (based on selected operating expenses, which include salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses) of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $365 million, $359 million and $342 million, respectively. We also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. Most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received, subject to a cap. Except for the per diem amounts, our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care; therefore, we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts. Most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospitals eligibility for Medicaid DSH payments. The estimated costs (based on the selected operating expenses described above) of caring for charity care patients for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $118 million, $113 million and $121 million, respectively. 46 Table of Contents The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are currently working on legislation that would make significant changes to the U.S. health care system, including changes designed to expand insurance coverage to many of the estimated 47 million Americans who are uninsured. A reduction in the number of self pay patients likely would favorably impact our revenues and provision for doubtful accounts; however, with final legislation still pending, we are unable to predict what impact such legislation ultimately might have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 8,808 $ 8,412 $ 396 Other operations 206 173 33 Net operating revenues 9,014 8,585 429 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 3,857 3,779 78 Supplies 1,569 1,511 58 Provision for doubtful accounts 697 628 69 Other operating expenses, net 1,909 1,928 (19 ) Depreciation and amortization 386 371 15 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 27 16 11 Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 31 41 (10 ) Operating income $ 538 $ 311 $ 227 Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals 97.7 % 98.0 % (0.3 )% Other operations 2.3 % 2.0 % 0.3 % Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 42.8 % 44.0 % (1.2 )% Supplies 17.4 % 17.6 % (0.2 )% Provision for doubtful accounts 7.7 % 7.3 % 0.4 % Other operating expenses, net 21.2 % 22.5 % (1.3 )% Depreciation and amortization 4.3 % 4.3 % % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.1 % Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 0.3 % 0.5 % (0.2 )% Operating income 6.0 % 3.6 % 2.4 % Net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues, as well as nonpatient revenues (primarily rental income, management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias, gift shops and parking) and other miscellaneous revenue. Net operating revenues of other operations primarily consist of revenues from (1) physician practices, (2) a rehabilitation hospital, which we closed during the three months ended March 31, 2009, and (3) a long term acute care hospital. Only one of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% (approximately 5.1%) of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, and one represented more than 5% (approximately 5.5%) of our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2009. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $206 million and $173 million in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in net operating revenues from other operations during 2009 primarily relates to our additional owned physician practices. Equity earnings for unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $6 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 47 Table of Contents The tables below show certain selected historical operating statistics of our continuing hospitals on a same hospital basis. We have excluded two of our hospitals from the same hospital statistics for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The hospitals excluded are Sierra Providence East Medical Center, which opened in May 2008, and NorthShore Regional Medical Center, which was reclassified to discontinued operations during the three months ended June 30, 2009.

REVENUES During the year ended December 31, 2009, net operating revenues from continuing operations increased 5.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 2.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. There were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues. Key positive factors include: Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts; Favorable adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances of $15 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3 million in the year ended December 31, 2008; and DSH payments and other state funded subsidy payments of $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $153 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. Key negative factors include: A decrease in same hospital commercial managed care admissions of 4.7%. Same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 6.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The primary reasons for this increase are improved managed care pricing and increased volume levels. Total same hospital outpatient visits and outpatient surgery visits for 2009 increased by 3.4% and 3.5%, respectively, compared to 2008. Commercial managed care outpatient visits declined 1.2% in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. 50 Table of Contents SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Same hospital salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased by approximately 1.3% in 2009 as compared to 2008. This increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, an increase in the number of employed physicians and higher incentive compensation and health benefits costs, partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount, reduced contract labor expense, lower stock based compensation expense, and lower overtime costs. Contract labor expense, which is included in salaries, wages and benefits, was $81 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $63 million, or 43.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, approximately 19% of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions. Labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory. We and the hospital industry in general, are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country. We expect this trend to be even more pronounced in 2010, as we renegotiate our existing labor contracts, all of which are scheduled to expire in the next 14 months. As union activity increases, our operating expenses may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that could significantly change both union organizing and bargaining over initial labor contracts in a way that is likely to increase union membership, at least in the short term. We are unable to predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to this or any other labor related legislation or the impact such legislation might ultimately have on our relations with employees and unions. We currently have labor contracts and collective bargaining agreements with the California Nurses Association (CNA), the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the United Nurses Associations of California (UNAC) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that cover registered nurses, service and maintenance workers, and other employees at 10 of our general hospitals in California, three of our general hospitals in Florida and one of our general hospitals in Philadelphia. All of these union agreements set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations through various dates in 2010 and early 2011. In January 2010, we commenced the process of renegotiating these contracts, beginning with our collective bargaining agreements with UNAC at two of our hospitals in California. We also have separate peace accords with both the CNA and the SEIU that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize certain of our employees and establish specific guidelines for the parties to follow with respect to organizing activities. Both peace accords expire in December 2011. The CNA and the SEIU have engaged in union organizing activities at several of our hospitals in Houston, Memphis and Philadelphia pursuant to the terms of the peace accords. Registered nurses at two of these facilities have participated in elections concerning CNA representation, but to date union organizing has been successful at only Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center (CyFair). After extended collective bargaining negotiations over an initial contract for CyFair, the CNA triggered an agreed to interest arbitration process, which began in June 2009, that provides for a neutral third party to mediate unresolved contract terms. If the mediation is unsuccessful, those unresolved terms will be decided by binding arbitration. We also are defending various allegations that we are in violation of federal labor laws or the terms of our collective bargaining agreements and peace accords, and we expect to continue to be subject to such claims from time to time in the normal course of business. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 17.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008; supplies expense per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis increased by 2.7% in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in supplies expense is primarily due to the increase in the number of surgeries, which grew by 1.6%, and increased utilization of high cost implants, high cost pharmaceuticals and increased orthopedic costs. A portion of the increase in supplies expense was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers. We strive to control supplies expense through product standardization, bulk purchases, contract compliance, improved utilization and operational improvements that should minimize waste. The items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers, orthopedics and implants, and high cost pharmaceuticals. We also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of Broadlane, Inc., a company that offers group purchasing procurement strategy, outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry. 51 Table of Contents As part of health care reform legislation, Congress is considering imposing an annual tax on manufacturers of certain medical devices and pharmaceuticals, as well as other provisions that could affect hospital group purchasing organizations. We are unable to predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to the legislation or the impact those provisions ultimately might have on our supplies expense, if enacted. PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues on a same hospital basis was 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts was related to decreased collection rates on self pay accounts, higher pricing and higher patient insurance deductibles, partially offset by the decline in uninsured revenues and improved managed care accounts receivable aging categories. Our self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 30.1% in the year ended December 31, 2009 from 32.5% in the prior year. The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008: December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts Net AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts Net Medicare $ 162 $ $ 162 $ 156 $ $ 156 Medicaid 106 106 121 121 Net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (24 ) (24 ) (20 ) (20 ) Commercial managed care 527 62 465 549 71 478 Governmental managed care 185 185 175 175 Self pay uninsured 204 175 29 190 161 29 Self pay balance after insurance 118 62 56 139 71 68 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agencies 35 35 40 40 Other payers 164 42 122 176 40 136 Total continuing operations 1,477 341 1,136 1,526 343 1,183 Total discontinued operations 50 28 22 207 53 154 $ 1,527 $ 369 $ 1,158 $ 1,733 $ 396 $ 1,337 A significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients, as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. Collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus, particularly over the past several years, as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix. At December 31, 2009, our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 30.1%, including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency. During 2008 and 2009, we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows: 35.0% at March 31, 2008; 34.0% at June 30, 2008; 33.3% at September 30, 2008; 32.5% at December 31, 2008; 31.4% at March 31, 2009; 30.8% at June 30, 2009 and 30.3% at September 30, 2009. These self pay collection rates include payments made by patients, including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance, prior to an account being classified and assigned to our in house self pay collection group. Based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at December 31, 2009, a hypothetical 10% decline in our self pay collection rate, or approximately 3.0%, would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $6 million. We have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible. We are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. 52 Table of Contents Payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts. We typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes; however, we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services. Our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately 98.0% at December 31, 2009 and 97.8% at December 31, 2008, which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency. We continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow. One specific initiative is our Center for Patient Access Services (CPAS), which was completed during 2009 at the hospitals scheduled to participate in the program. CPAS is a centralized, dedicated operation that performs financial clearance, including completing insurance eligibility checks, documenting verification of benefits, providing required notifications to managed care payers, obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling. Although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable. We manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as (1) total cash collections, (2) point of service cash collections, (3) accounts receivable days outstanding (AR Days), and (4) accounts receivable by aging category. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from continuing operations of $1.160 billion and $1.203 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $24 million and $20 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively: December 31, 2009 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 94 % 63 % 78 % 26 % 69 % 61 120 days 3 % 24 % 12 % 27 % 15 % 121 180 days 3 % 11 % 5 % 13 % 6 % Over 180 days % 2 % 5 % 34 % 10 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % December 31, 2008 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 99 % 64 % 77 % 33 % 69 % 61 120 days 1 % 24 % 14 % 24 % 15 % 121 180 days % 12 % 5 % 11 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 4 % 32 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 46 days at December 31, 2009 and 50 days at December 31, 2008. AR Days at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were within our targets of less than 50 and 55 days, respectively. AR Days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter. As of December 31, 2009, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $4.3 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house collection agency. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts at collection agencies is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. Patient advocates from our Medical Eligibility Program (MEP) screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs. They also expedite the process of applying for these government programs. Receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for Medicaid are classified as Medicaid pending, under our MEP, with appropriate contractual allowances recorded. Based on recent trends, approximately 91% of all accounts in our MEP are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as Medicaid. 53 Table of Contents The following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our MEP still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2009 and 2008 by aging category: December 31, 2009 2008 0 60 days $ 66 $ 87 61 120 days 18 25 121 180 days 5 6 Over 180 days(1) Total $ 89 $ 118 (1) Includes accounts receivable of $10 million at both December 31, 2009 and 2008 that are fully reserved. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, NET Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased by 1.3% in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis decreased by approximately 1.6% in 2009 as compared to 2008. Contributing to this decrease was a $37 million, or 29.4%, decline in total hospital malpractice expense to $89 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $126 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in malpractice expense is principally due to a 6% reduction in the number of expected claims, partially offset by a 63 basis point decline in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future liabilities. Declines in consulting costs, utility costs, reimbursable business expenses, recruiting related costs and systems implementations costs also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses. These declines were partially offset by increases in other items, including higher physician fees relating to increased emergency department on call payments and higher costs for contracted services, as well as a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $27 million. We recorded a $7 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one hospital to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital, consistent with our prior estimates during 2008 when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. Unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying values of the long lived assets, this hospital is at risk of future impairments, particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate continues to decline. We also recorded a $10 million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the current campus of one hospital that is scheduled to move to a new, replacement campus during 2010. Our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from use of the current campus for several months during 2010 and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings at the current campus. We compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and, because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 include $4 million of employee severance and other related costs, a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals as a result of the buyer filing for bankruptcy, and a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of other assets primarily related to an option to purchase certain real property near one of our hospitals that no longer has value due to the financial condition of the owner of the real property. During the year ended December 31, 2008, net impairment and restructuring charges of $16 million included an $8 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of two hospitals to their estimated fair values due to adverse current and anticipated future financial trends based on their most recent projections at that time. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends include shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers and high levels of uninsured patients. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 include $6 million of employee severance and other related costs, $1 million for the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and $6 million in impairment charges for the write down of other assets primarily due to the write down of costs associated with an expansion project at one of our hospitals that we decided not to pursue based on unfavorable economics forecasted for the project, partially offset by a $5 million reduction in reserves recorded in prior periods. 54 Table of Contents Our impairment tests presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results of our hospitals, which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospitals most recent projections. If these projections are not met, or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we may incur additional restructuring charges. Future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS, NET OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $31 million compared to $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The 2009 costs primarily relate to reserves established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2009 costs also include amounts paid to indemnify a former officer of the Company in a matter to which the Company was not a party and costs to defend the Company in various matters. The 2008 costs primarily relate to changes in our estimated liability for now settled wage and hour actions further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2008 costs were partially offset by $6 million of insurance proceeds that were recorded as a recovery of litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for costs we previously incurred related to our December 2004 Redding Medical Center litigation settlement. INTEREST EXPENSE During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded interest expense of $445 million compared to $418 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in interest expense primarily relates to higher interest rates on the senior secured notes issued in 2009, partially offset by the impact of interest rate swap and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) cap agreements, all as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. GAIN (LOSS) FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $134 million relating to the estimated fair values of our new senior secured notes due in 2015 and 2018 issued in a note exchange at less than their par values, net of the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the senior notes tendered. In the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $24 million in connection with the purchases of our senior notes due 2014 related to the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs. Also during the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $3 million for cash we received relating to the difference in the fair values of tendered senior notes due in 2011 and 2012 as compared to the fair values of the senior secured notes due 2015 and 2018 issued in connection with an exchange, net of the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the senior notes tendered. During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22 million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the $308 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2015 that we repurchased during the period, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs associated with the notes. We also completed open market repurchases of approximately $68 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2031 for cash of approximately $60 million. We recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6 million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes, partially offset by the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details about our recent debt transactions. 55 Table of Contents INVESTMENT EARNINGS During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded no net investment earnings compared to investment earnings of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In 2009, investment earnings were offset a $7 million loss related to an agreement reached during June 2009 for the early redemption of our $56 million investment in hospital authority bonds related to previously divested hospitals in the Dallas, Texas area for $49 million of cash that we received in June 2009. In the year ended December 31, 2008, $10 million was recorded in investment earnings related to the Redding Medical Center litigation settlement. NET GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain on sale of investments of approximately $15 million related to the sale of our 50% membership interest in Peoples Health Network. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded net gains of $125 million from the sale of our entire interest in Broadlane, Inc. and $14 million on the sale of our interest in a joint venture with a real estate investment trust. INCOME TAX BENEFIT During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $23 million compared to $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about income taxes. ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL NON GAAP DISCLOSURES The financial information provided throughout this report, including in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, we use certain non GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements, some of which are recurring or involve cash payments. In addition, we from time to time use these measures to define certain performance targets under our compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA is a non GAAP measure that we use in our analysis of the performance of our business, which we define as net income attributable to our common shareholders before: (1) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax; (2) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (3) preferred stock dividends; (4) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (5) income tax (expense) benefit; (6) net gain (loss) on sales of investments; (7) investment earnings (loss); (8) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt; (9) interest expense; (10) litigation and investigation (costs) benefit, net of insurance recoveries; (11) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs; (12) impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries; (13) amortization; and (14) depreciation. As is the case with all non GAAP measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with this metric, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another, and should recognize that Adjusted EBITDA does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance because it excludes many items that are included in our financial statements. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance. 56 Table of Contents The table below shows the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to our common shareholders (the most comparable GAAP term) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Net income attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders $ 181 $ 25 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (10 ) (7 ) Preferred stock dividends (6 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (31 ) (47 ) Income from continuing operations 228 79 Income tax benefit 23 25 Investment earnings 22 Gain from early extinguishment of debt 97 Net gain on sales of investments 15 139 Interest expense (445 ) (418 ) Operating income 538 311 Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries (31 ) (41 ) Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges (27 ) (16 ) Amortization (44 ) (38 ) Depreciation (342 ) (333 ) Adjusted EBITDA 982 $ 739 Less: Adjusted EBITDA of hospital without a full calendar year of operating results in 2008 16 (10 ) Same hospital Adjusted EBITDA $ 966 $ 749 Net operating revenues $ 9,014 $ 8,585 Less: Revenues of hospital without full calendar year of operating results in 2008 96 32 Same hospital net operating revenues $ 8,918 $ 8,553 Adjusted EBITDA as % of net operating revenues (Adjusted EBITDA margin) 10.9 % 8.6 % Adjusted same hospital EBITDA as % of same hospital net operating revenues (Adjusted same hospital EBITDA margin) 10.8 % 8.8 % Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non GAAP term that we define as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less income tax refunds (payments), payments against reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs and settlements, operating cash flows from discontinued operations, capital expenditures in continuing operations, and new hospital construction expenditures. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a measure of liquidity that we use in our business as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. We provide this financial measure as a supplement to GAAP information to assist ourselves and investors in understanding the impact of various items on our cash flows, some of which are recurring. Because Adjusted Free Cash Flow excludes many items that are included in our financial statements, it does not provide a complete measure of our liquidity. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our liquidity. The following table shows the reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP term) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 425 $ 208 Less: Income tax payments, net (43 ) (4 ) Payments against reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs and settlements (192 ) (100 ) Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations 40 18 Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations 620 294 Purchases of property and equipment continuing operations (397 ) (452 ) Construction of new and replacement hospitals (58 ) (75 ) Adjusted Free Cash Flow continuing operations $ 165 $ (233 ) 57 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 8,412 $ 7,926 $ 486 Other operations 173 157 16 Net operating revenues 8,585 8,083 502 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 3,779 3,617 162 Supplies 1,511 1,401 110 Provision for doubtful accounts 628 555 73 Other operating expenses, net 1,928 1,852 76 Depreciation and amortization 371 336 35 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries 16 36 (20 ) Hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs (3 ) 3 Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 41 13 28 Operating income $ 311 $ 276 $ 35 Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals 98.0 % 98.1 % (0.1 )% Other operations 2.0 % 1.9 % 0.1 % Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 44.0 % 44.7 % (0.7 )% Supplies 17.6 % 17.3 % 0.3 % Provision for doubtful accounts 7.3 % 6.9 % 0.4 % Other operating expenses, net 22.5 % 22.9 % (0.4 )% Depreciation and amortization 4.3 % 4.2 % 0.1 % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries 0.2 % 0.4 % (0.2 )% Hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs % % % Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 0.5 % 0.2 % 0.3 % Operating income 3.6 % 3.4 % 0.2 % Only one of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% (approximately 5.2%) of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, and none represented more than 5% of our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2008. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $173 million and $157 million in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Equity earnings for unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $13 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tables below show certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing general hospitals on a same hospital basis. We have excluded two of our hospitals from the same hospital statistics for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The hospitals excluded are Coastal Carolina Medical Center, which we acquired in June 2007, and Sierra Providence East Medical Center, which opened in May 2008. 58 Table of Contents Same HospitalContinuing Operations Years Ended December 31, Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) Commercial managed care admission 139,862 144,021 (2.9 )% Governmental managed care admissions 109,357 96,564 13.2 % Medicare admissions 160,840 163,530 (1.6 )% Medicaid admissions 64,339 63,763 0.9 % Uninsured admissions 23,901 23,429 2.0 % Charity care admissions 9,276 10,153 (8.6 )% Other admissions 13,811 13,118 5.3 % Total admissions 521,386 514,578 1.3 % Paying admissions (excludes charity and uninsured) 488,209 480,996 1.5 % Total government program admissions 334,536 323,857 33.0 % Charity admissions and uninsured admissions 33,177 33,582 (1.2 )% Admissions through emergency department 292,432 284,417 2.8 % Commercial managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions 26.8 % 28.0 % (1.2 )%(1) Emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions 56.1 % 55.3 % 0.8 %(1) Uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions 4.6 % 4.6 % %(1) Charity admissions as a percentage of total admissions 1.8 % 2.0 % (0.2 )%(1) Surgeries inpatient 154,117 153,052 0.7 % Surgeries outpatient 201,598 198,009 1.8 % Total surgeries 355,715 351,061 1.3 % Patient days total 2,580,612 2,567,878 0.5 % Adjusted patient days(2) 3,717,171 3,650,471 1.8 % Patient days commercial managed care 562,413 586,500 (4.1 )% Average length of stay (days) 4.9 5.0 (0.1 )%(1) Adjusted patient admissions(2) 756,253 736,720 2.7 % Number of general hospitals (at end of period) 47 47 %(1) Licensed beds (at end of period) 13,246 13,289 (0.3 )% Average licensed beds 13,233 13,266 (0.2 )% Utilization of licensed beds(3) 53.3 % 53.0 % 0.3 %(1) (1) The change is the difference between the 2008 and 2007 amounts shown.

Our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 4.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. There were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues. Key positive factors include: Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts, partially offset by a reduction in stop loss payments to $239 million in 2008 from $278 million in 2007; and An increase in total admissions and patient days. Key negative factors include: A decrease in commercial managed care admissions; A decrease in DSH payments under various states Medicaid programs to $153 million in 2008 from $162 million in 2007; and Favorable adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances of $3 million in 2008 compared to $45 million in 2007. Same hospital admissions for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 1.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to net volume increases in many of the service lines emphasized by our Targeted Growth Initiative, psychiatric volumes at a facility we acquired in Modesto, California in November 2007, and a net growth in physicians resulting from our general focus on recruitment efforts and our targeted physician recruitment strategies at various hospitals for specific service lines, partially offset by lower invasive cardiac procedures. Same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 8.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, while outpatient visits declined by 0.1% for the same periods. The primary reason for the revenue increase is improved managed care pricing. SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Same hospital salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately 1.9% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, an increase in the number of employed physicians, increased health benefits and retirement plans costs, increased annual incentive compensation costs, and hurricane related labor costs, partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount, a decline in contract labor expenses and stock compensation expense, and improved workers compensation loss experience. Included in salaries, wages and benefits expense in the year ended December 31, 2008 is $33 million of stock based compensation expense compared to $40 million in 2007. The decrease is primarily due to the vesting of higher grant date fair value awards from prior years and the issuance of new awards at lower grant date fair values primarily due to our lower stock price. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues increased by 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007; supplies expense per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis increased approximately 5.7% in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day reflects higher costs for orthopedics, pharmaceuticals and implants due to increased volumes, inflation and technology improvements, and higher surgical supply costs due to an increase in surgeries, partially offset by lower cardiovascular supply costs, which resulted from a decrease in cardiovascular procedures. 61 Table of Contents PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues on a same hospital basis was 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The negative impact on bad debts as a result of the growth in self pay accounts assigned to our collection agencies, a slight decline in self pay collection trends since the first half of 2008, pricing increases and improved charge capture in our emergency departments were partially mitigated by improved point of service collections and improved managed care accounts receivable balances by aging category. The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts Net AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts AllowanceforDoubtfulAccounts Net (In Millions) Medicare $ 156 $ $ 156 $ 163 $ $ 163 Medicaid 121 121 134 134 Net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (20 ) (20 ) (16 ) (16 ) Commercial managed care 549 71 478 525 77 448 Governmental managed care 175 175 167 167 Self pay uninsured 190 161 29 190 150 40 Self pay balance after insurance 139 71 68 127 66 61 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agencies 40 40 32 32 Other payers 176 40 136 204 66 138 Total continuing operations 1,526 343 1,183 1,526 359 1,167 Total discontinued operations 207 53 154 300 82 218 $ 1,733 $ 396 $ 1,337 $ 1,826 $ 441 $ 1,385 At December 31, 2008, our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 32.5%, including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors. During 2008, we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows: 35.0% at March 31, 2008; 34.0% at June 30, 2008; and 33.3% at September 30, 2008. These self pay collection rates include payments made by patients, including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance, prior to an account being classified and assigned to our in house self pay collection agency. The comparable self pay collection percentage as of December 31, 2007, adjusted for the reclassification of certain hospitals to discontinued operations, was approximately 35.0%. Our provision for doubtful accounts in the three months ended December 31, 2008 includes a $4 million unfavorable adjustment in the estimate of necessary bad debt reserve levels at year end compared to a favorable adjustment of $16 million in the three months ended December 31, 2007. The change in anticipated collections as of December 31, 2008 was based on a look back period of 18 months of collections. Our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately 98.0% at both December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, adjusted for hospitals reclassified to discontinued operations, which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our continuing operations net accounts receivable of $1.203 billion and $1.183 billion, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $20 million and $16 million, at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively: December 31, 2008 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 99 % 64 % 77 % 33 % 69 % 61 120 days 1 % 24 % 14 % 24 % 15 % 121 180 days % 12 % 5 % 11 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 4 % 32 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 62 Table of Contents December 31, 2007 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 96 % 63 % 76 % 34 % 69 % 61 120 days 3 % 25 % 15 % 25 % 16 % 121 180 days 1 % 12 % 5 % 12 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 4 % 29 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 50 days at December 31, 2008 and 52 days at December 31, 2007. AR Days at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were within our target at that time of less than 55 days. As of December 31, 2008, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $4.4 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house and outside collection agencies or vendors. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts at collection agencies is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. The following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our MEP, still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2008 and 2007 by aging category: December 31, 2008 2007 0 60 days $ 87 $ 58 61 120 days 25 15 121 180 days 6 6 Over 180 days(1) Total $ 118 $ 79 (1) Includes accounts receivable of $10 million at both December 31, 2008 and 2007 that are fully reserved. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, NET Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased by 0.4% in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis increased by approximately 1.2% in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to higher physician fees, contracted services, repair and maintenance costs, utility costs and an $8 million gain on a sale of a medical office building in Florida in 2007, which reduced 2007 other operating expenses, partially offset by lower information systems implementation costs, consulting costs and malpractice expense. Malpractice expense was $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in malpractice expense is principally due to a 5% reduction in the number of expected claims, partially offset by a 118 basis point decline in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future liabilities. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $16 million. We recorded an $8 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of two hospitals to their estimated fair values due to adverse current and anticipated future financial trends based on their most recent projections at that time. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends include shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers and high levels of uninsured patients. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 include $6 million of employee severance and other related costs, $1 million for the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and $6 million in impairment charges for the write down of other assets primarily due to the write down of costs associated with an expansion project at one of our hospitals that we decided not to pursue based on unfavorable economics forecasted for the project, partially offset by a $5 million reduction in reserves recorded in prior periods. 63 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2007, net impairment and restructuring charges of $36 million included a $14 million net impairment charge primarily for the write down of buildings and equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one hospital to its estimated fair value due to adverse current and anticipated future financial trends based on its most recent projections at that time. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends included reductions in volume from insured patients due to competition and shifts in payer mix, increased uninsured patients, adverse trends in provision for doubtful accounts and reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 include $18 million of employee severance and other related costs, $7 million in lease costs, $1 million for the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and $3 million in impairment charges for the write down of other assets, partially offset by $5 million of insurance proceeds for property damage from Hurricane Wilma and a $2 million reduction of reserves recorded in prior periods. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS, NET OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $41 million compared to $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 costs primarily relate to changes in our estimated liability for now settled wage and hour actions further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2008 costs were partially offset by $6 million of insurance proceeds that were recorded as a recovery of litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for costs we previously incurred related to our December 2004 Redding Medical Center litigation settlement. NET GAIN ON SALES OF INVESMENTS During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded net gains of $125 million from the sale of our entire interest in Broadlane, Inc. and $14 million on the sale of our interest in a joint venture with a real estate investment trust. INCOME TAX BENEFIT Income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2008 included an income tax benefit of $27 million to reduce our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including related interest, and an income tax benefit of $29 million to decrease the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and for other tax adjustments. Income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2007 included an income tax benefit of $82 million to reduce our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including related interest, and income tax expense of $41 million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and for other tax adjustments. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about income taxes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH REQUIREMENTS Our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees, are summarized in the table below, all as of December 31, 2009: Years Ending December 31, Later Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Years (In Millions) Long term debt(1) $ 7,507 $ 390 $ 451 $ 436 $ 1,340 $ 402 $ 4,488 Global civil settlement payable(1) 73 73 Capital lease obligations(1) 2 2 Long term non cancelable operating leases 400 99 82 70 60 26 63 Standby letters of credit 185 183 2 Guarantees(2) 118 80 24 5 3 2 4 Asset retirement obligations 155 155 Academic affiliation agreements(3) 247 34 33 18 17 17 128 Tax liabilities 77 28 49 Supplemental executive retirement plan obligations 514 18 19 19 19 19 420 Information technology contract services 863 119 138 140 133 108 225 Purchase orders 188 188 Total $ 10,329 $ 1,212 $ 749 $ 688 $ 1,572 $ 574 $ 5,534 (1) Includes interest through maturity date/lease termination. (2) Includes minimum revenue guarantees, primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals, and operating lease guarantees. (3) These agreements contain various rights and termination provisions. 64 Table of Contents The standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs. The amount of collateral required is principally dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness. The insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers. The standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility. In 2009, we refinanced approximately $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt through tender offers and exchange offers. We also repurchased approximately $381 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt through privately negotiated transactions and open market repurchases. These transactions, which were financed with the issuances of new debt securities, the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and cash on hand, are part of our long term objective to manage the risks associated with our high levels of debt. We may from time to time seek to retire, purchase, redeem or refinance additional amounts of our outstanding debt subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. These actions are part of our strategy to manage our leverage over time, which is dependent on our total amount of debt, our cash and our operating results, with a long term target to maintain our ratio of total long term debt, net of cash and cash equivalent balances, to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) at 4.0x or below. At December 31, 2009, using the last 12 months of Adjusted EBITDA, this ratio was 3.7x. We anticipate this ratio will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on earnings performance and other factors. We intend to pursue our objectives by following our business plan, managing our cost structure and through other changes in our capital structure, including, if appropriate, the issuance of equity or convertible securities. Our ability to achieve these long term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities, including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations, equipment and information systems additions and replacements, introduction of new medical technologies, design and construction of new buildings, and various other capital improvements. Capital expenditures were $456 million, $547 million and $743 million in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2010 will total approximately $475 million to $525 million, including $66 million that was accrued at December 31, 2009, but not paid until 2010. Our anticipated 2010 capital expenditures include approximately $4 million to meet seismic requirements for our California facilities. We currently estimate spending a total of approximately $80 million to comply with the requirements under Californias seismic regulations, of which approximately $24 million was spent prior to January 1, 2010. Our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than certain previous estimates because a number of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using a new seismic evaluation tool. There may be further reductions to our estimated seismic costs as the State of California has recently enacted new regulations relating to the seismic evaluation tool and the new state building code; we are currently evaluating these new regulations to determine what impact they will have on our cost estimate. Our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for future inflation. Our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2010 also include approximately $12 million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit. We expect to spend a total of approximately $111 million on such improvements over the next six years. Interest payments, net of capitalized interest, were $439 million, $391 million and $395 million in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase is primarily due to monthly interest payments under our interest rate swap agreement, higher interest rate debt issued during the year and interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of our various long term debt transactions discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which became effective May 1, 2009, for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion. The interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates. It had the effect of converting our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2013 from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid monthly based on the one month LIBOR plus a floating rate spread of approximately 5.46%. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the 7 3/8% senior notes, which substantially offset each other, were recorded in interest expense. To mitigate risks related to potential significant increases in the one month LIBOR, we also entered into a separate agreement that limited the maximum one month LIBOR to 8% under the interest rate swap agreement. In November 2009, we terminated the interest rate swap agreement. We realized approximately $8 million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement. Depending on then existing market conditions, we may elect to enter into similar interest rate swap agreements in the future. 65 Table of Contents Income tax payments, net of tax refunds, were approximately $43 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to approximately $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of (1) federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion pretax expiring in 2024 to 2029, (2) approximately $25 million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration, and (3) general business credit carryforwards of approximately $13 million expiring in 2023 to 2029. Periodic examinations of our tax returns by the IRS or other taxing authorities could result in the payment of additional taxes. Our tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007 are currently under examination by the IRS. These returns include deductions for amounts paid in connection with our 2006 civil settlement with the federal government and upon which taxes had been paid by us in previous taxable years. We filed tax refund claims to recover such previously paid taxes, and we received tax refunds of approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2009. The tax treatment of the civil settlement payments is being considered as part of the IRS examination. We presently cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this IRS examination, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period. These ownership changes include the offering of stock by us, the purchase or sale of our stock by 5% shareholders, as defined in the Treasury regulations, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock. If such ownership changes by 5% shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed 50 percentage points during the three year period, then Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards. SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily derived from cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities, and proceeds from the sale of USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital. Our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable. As we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients grow, our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $425 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $208 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. Key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the 2009 and 2008 periods include the following: Additional interest payments of $48 million, primarily due to monthly interest payments under our interest rate swap agreement, higher interest rate debt issued during the year and interest payments that were accelerated and paid in 2009 as a result of our various long term debt transactions discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; $39 million we received under our interest rate swap agreement; Increased operating income from continuing operations of $243 million, excluding litigation and investigation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, and depreciation and amortization in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008; $81 million in payments related to our 2009 settlement of wage and hour actions; Increased income tax payments of $39 million, including $60 million in settlement of IRS audit disputes as discussed above; $60 million of insurance recoveries received in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to our December 2004 Redding Medical Center litigation settlement (based on the components of the recoveries, $39 million was classified as discontinued operations cash flows from operations and $21 million was classified as continuing operations cash flows from operations); $61 million of additional cash flows related to divested hospitals classified as discontinued operations primarily due to the liquidation of accounts receivable and other working capital balances (such amount excludes the $39 million of insurance recoveries received in 2008 related to Redding Medical Center discussed above); Additional cash flows as a result of enhanced management of account payable ($39 million) and accounts receivable ($70 million); 66 Table of Contents Lease termination payments of $9 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 associated with the divestiture of the Tarzana campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center; Additional aggregate annual 401(k) matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of $7 million ($123 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $116 million in 2008); and Lower cash investment earnings of approximately $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received net cash proceeds of $221 million from the sale of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations, primarily from the sale of USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital. Excluding the simultaneous purchase and sale of the Tarzana campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center for $89 million, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we received proceeds of $71 million from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations, primarily from the sales of North Ridge Medical Center, the Encino campus of Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center, Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center, and San Dimas Community Hospital. We received proceeds, which are classified as investing activities, of $49 million and $8 million from our investment in hospital authority bonds related to previously divested hospitals in the Dallas, Texas area during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also received proceeds, which are classified as investing activities, of $18 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 related to the sale of our 50% interest in Peoples Health Network and, during the year ended December 31, 2008, of $144 million from the sale of our entire interest in Broadlane, Inc. and $25 million from the sale of our interest in a joint venture with a real estate investment trust. We continue to seek further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet by generating incremental cash. These initiatives include the sale of our medical office buildings and excess land, buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets. We are currently seeking to sell up to 30 of our 47 owned medical office buildings. However, there is no assurance that we will consummate a sale of these buildings. Capital expenditures were $456 million and $547 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, including approximately $58 million and $75 million in the same respective years for construction of Sierra Providence East Medical Center, our new hospital in El Paso, Texas, and a replacement hospital for East Cooper Regional Medical Center in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina. We use fair market value to record our investments that are available for sale. As shown in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs. However, at December 31, 2009, one of our captive insurance subsidiaries held $1 million (principal value) of auction rate securities, classified as investments, whose auctions have failed due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. In addition, we held $2 million of investments in the Reserve Yield Plus Fund and have reclassified the balance out of cash equivalents as the fund has experienced liquidity issues and temporarily suspended distributions. The fund is currently in the process of liquidating its investments and distributing cash to its investors. We expect the fund to liquidate all of its investments; however, the ultimate timing is uncertain. We will continue to closely monitor our investments, but do not anticipate any future decrease in value of either the auction rate securities or the Reserve Yield Plus Fund to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have no other investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the current economic crisis that will materially impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND RELATED COVENANTS Credit Agreement We have a five year, $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which matures on November 16, 2011, that is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals, and bears interest at our option based on LIBOR plus 150 basis points or Citigroups base rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus 50 basis points. The revolving credit agreement contains standard covenants and also includes a provision, which we believe is customary in receivables backed credit facilities, that gives our banks the right to require that proceeds of collections of substantially all of our consolidated accounts receivable be applied directly to repay outstanding loans and other amounts that are due and payable under the revolving credit facility at any time that unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is less than $100 million or if an event of default has occurred and is continuing thereunder. In that event, we would seek to re borrow under the revolving credit facility to satisfy our operating cash requirements. Our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to conditions that we believe are customary in such facilities, including that no events of default then exist. For additional information, refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 67 Table of Contents We are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our revolving credit agreement. Our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, based on our eligible receivables, was $448 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and we had approximately $185 million of letters of credit outstanding. We also had approximately $690 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2009 to fund our operations and capital expenditures. Senior Notes In December 2009, we completed open market repurchases of $2 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 6 3/8 % senior notes due 2011 and approximately $1 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 9 1/4 % senior notes due 2015 for cash of approximately $3 million. In November 2009, we completed open market repurchases of $2 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 9 1/ 4% senior notes due 2015 for cash of approximately $2 million. In September 2009, we repurchased approximately $8 million of additional aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 9 1/4% senior notes due 2015 for cash of approximately $8 million. Also in September 2009, we purchased $300 million of the $800 million aggregate principal amount then outstanding of our 9 1/4% senior notes due 2015 for $315 million. The purchase was funded with the net proceeds from our September 2009 sale of 7% mandatory convertible preferred stock as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the repurchase, we paid approximately $4 million in accrued and unpaid interest. This transaction resulted in a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22 million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs associated with the notes. In July 2009, we purchased approximately $15 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 3/8% senior notes due 2011, $32.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 1/2% senior notes due 2012, $0.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 9 7/8% senior notes due 2014, and $20.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 7/8% senior notes due 2031 for approximately $60 million. We recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6 million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes, partially offset by the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes. In June 2009, we purchased approximately $900 million of the $1 billion aggregate principal amount then outstanding of our 9 7/8% senior notes due 2014 for approximately $941 million, representing approximately $900 million in principal payments and approximately $41 million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase. We purchased the 9 7/8% senior notes with the net proceeds of approximately $881 million from our sale of new 8 7/8% senior secured notes, as described below, and cash on hand. In May and March 2009, we exchanged approximately $918 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 3/8% senior notes due 2011 and approximately $510 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 1 /2% senior notes due 2012 for new 9% senior secured notes due 2015 and 10% senior secured notes due 2018, as described below. For additional information regarding our senior notes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Senior Secured Notes In June 2009, we sold $925 million aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8% senior secured notes due 2019. We will pay interest on the notes semi annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The 8 7/8% senior secured notes rank equally with our 9% senior secured notes due 2015 and 10% senior secured notes due 2018, which we issued in May and March 2009, as described below. In May 2009, we exchanged approximately $3 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 3 /8% senior notes due 2011 and approximately $25 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 1/2% senior notes due 2012 for approximately $14 million aggregate principal amount of 9% senior secured notes due 2015 and approximately $14 million aggregate principal amount of 10% senior secured notes due 2018. In addition, we received approximately $6 million in cash, which represented the difference in the fair values of the tendered notes as compared to the fair values of the 9% senior secured notes and 10% senior secured notes and compensation to us for increased interest expense. In March 2009, we exchanged approximately $915 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 3/8% senior notes due 2011 and approximately $485 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6 1/2% senior notes due 2012 for approximately $700 million aggregate principal amount of 9% senior secured notes due 2015 and approximately $700 million aggregate principal amount of 10% senior secured notes due 2018. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2009. The 9% and 10% senior secured notes rank equally with our 8 7/8% senior secured notes. 68 Table of Contents For additional information regarding our senior secured notes, refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Swap Agreement We entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which became effective May 1, 2009, for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion. The interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates. It had the effect of converting our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2013 from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid monthly based on the one month LIBOR plus a floating rate spread of approximately 5.46%. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the 7 3/8% senior notes, which substantially offset each other, were recorded in interest expense. To mitigate risks related to potential significant increases in the one month LIBOR, we also entered into a LIBOR cap agreement that limited the maximum one month LIBOR to 8% under the interest rate swap agreement. We paid approximately $2 million for this limitation on interest rate exposure under the interest rate swap agreement. In November 2009, we terminated the interest rate swap agreement. We realized approximately $8 million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement. Depending on then existing market conditions, we may elect to enter into similar interest rate swap agreements in the future. LIQUIDITY From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital markets, bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time. We believe our existing agreements provide significant flexibility for future secured or unsecured borrowings. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand, availability under our revolving credit facility, anticipated future cash provided by operating activities, anticipated proceeds from the sales of assets held for sale, and our investments in marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet should be adequate to meet our current cash needs. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures, payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs. Long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities, results of balance sheet initiatives previously discussed and, given favorable market conditions, future borrowings or refinancings. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections, which could require us to pursue any number of financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt refinancing, asset sales or other financing alternatives. With the current tight credit markets, the level, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured, and the ability of our counterparties to close asset sales as previously anticipated could also be affected. We continue to aggressively identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. Among the areas being addressed are volume growth, managed care payer contracting, procurement efficiencies, cost standardization, bad debt expense reduction initiatives, underperforming hospitals, and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care. Although these initiatives may result in improved performance, that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Excluding the hospitals whose operating results are included in discontinued operations, our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include $923 million, $923 million and $888 million, respectively, of net operating revenues and $99 million, $89 million and $101 million, respectively, of income from operations generated from four general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the applicable buildings and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases. The current terms of these leases expire between 2010 and 2027, not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise. If these leases expire, we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals. 69 Table of Contents We have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, except for $303 million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of December 31, 2009. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use. In general, we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, given the particular circumstances in which we operate. Actual results may vary from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine, and (3) may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas: Recognition of net operating revenues, including contractual allowances; Provisions for doubtful accounts; Accruals for general and professional liability risks; Accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans; Accruals for litigation losses; Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill; Accounting for income taxes; and Accounting for stock based compensation. REVENUE RECOGNITION We recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed. Net operating revenues primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates (i.e., gross charges), less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances, principally for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care and other health plans, as well as uninsured patients under the Compact. Revenues under the traditional fee for service Medicare and Medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems. Discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues, which were more prevalent in earlier periods, and certain other payments, such as DSH, DGME, IME and bad debt expense, which are based on our hospitals cost reports, are estimated using historical trends and current factors. Cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by Medicare and Medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review, and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved. Because the laws, regulations, instructions and rule interpretations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently, the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts. We have a system and estimation process for recording Medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements. This results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports. For filed cost reports, we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports, and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. 70 Table of Contents Revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers. The payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis. At the end of each month, on an individual hospital basis, we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans. A 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances would impact the estimated reserves by $8 million. Some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include: (1) changes in reimbursement levels for procedures, supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered; (2) changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached; (3) changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing; (4) final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels; (5) secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments; and (6) reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels. Contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history. Although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill, we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. We do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues. In addition, on a corporate wide basis, we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans. Revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the Compact, whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance. We believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements. We know of no material claims, disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our Consolidated Financial Statements. PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Although outcomes vary, our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients, including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). Generally, as required by EMTALA, patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay. Therefore, services, including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient, are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information. In non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services, it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated; however, there are various exceptions that can occur. Such exceptions can include, for example, instances where (1) we are unable to obtain verification because the patients insurance company was unable to be reached or contacted, (2) a determination is made that a patient may be eligible for benefits under various government programs, such as Medicaid or Victims of Crime, and it takes several days or weeks before qualification for such benefits is confirmed or denied, and (3) under physician orders we provide services to patients that require immediate treatment. We provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital, our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an 18 month look back period, and other relevant factors. Based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at December 31, 2009, a hypothetical 10% decline in our self pay collection rate, or approximately 3.0%, would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $6 million. There are various factors that can impact collection trends, such as changes in the economy, which in turn have an impact on unemployment rates and the number of uninsured and underinsured patients, the volume of patients through the emergency department, the increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients with insurance, and business practices related to collection efforts. These factors continuously change and can have an impact on collection trends and our estimation process. Our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable, including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing. Generally, uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency between 90 to 180 days, once patient responsibility has been identified. When accounts are assigned to the collection agency by the hospital, the accounts are completely written off the hospitals books through the provision for doubtful accounts, and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospitals books at the same time. The estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates. The estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our in house collection agency. 71 Table of Contents Managed care accounts are collected through our regional business offices, whereby the account balances remain in the hospitals patient accounting system and on the hospitals books, and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age. Managed care accounts collected through our regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years. Changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts. We continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings. We aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal, including arbitration and litigation, but we may not be successful. ACCRUALS FOR GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY RISKS We accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims, to the extent not covered by insurance, when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We maintain reserves, which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks, including incurred but not reported claims, to the extent we do not have insurance coverage. Our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors, including the number of expected claims, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, the timing of historical payments, and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments. We consider the number of expected claims, average cost per claim and discount rate to be the most significant assumptions in estimating accruals for general and professional liabilities. Our liabilities are adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known. Malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our estimated reserves for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be a 5% increase or decrease in the number of expected claims or average cost per claim. A 5% increase in the number of expected claims would increase the estimated reserves by $37 million, and a 5% decrease in the number of expected claims would decrease the estimated reserves by $37 million. A 5% increase in the average cost per claim would increase the estimated reserves by $37 million, and a 5% decrease in the average cost per claim would decrease the estimated reserves by $37 million. Because our estimated reserves for future claim payments are discounted to present value, a change in our discount rate assumption could also have a significant impact on our estimated reserves. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the estimated reserves by $15 million. In addition, because of the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. The table below shows the case reserves and incurred but not reported claims reserves as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Case reserves $ 167 $ 185 $ 190 Incurred but not reported reserves 483 550 614 Total undiscounted reserves $ 650 $ 735 $ 804 Several actuarial methods, including incurred, paid loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, are applied to our historical loss data to produce estimates of ultimate expected losses and the resulting incurred but not reported reserves. These methods use our specific historical claims data related to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case reserves, reported and closed claim counts, and a variety of hospital census information. Based on these analyses, we determine our estimate of the professional liability claims, including the incurred but not reported reserve estimate. The determination of our estimates involves subjective judgment and could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods if our actual experience is materially different than our assumptions. Malpractice claims generally take 4 to 5 years to settle from the time of the initial reporting of the occurrence to the settlement payment. Accordingly, the percentage of reserves as of December 31, 2009 representing unsettled claims is approximately 99% compared to 98% as of December 31, 2008. 72 Table of Contents The following table presents the amount of our accruals for professional liability claims and the corresponding activity therein for each of the respective years presented below. Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Accrual for professional liability claims, beginning of the year $ 663 $ 716 $ 731 Expense (income) related to: Current accident year 121 130 168 Prior accident years (74 ) (39 ) (5 ) Expense (income) from discounting 9 24 4 Total incurred loss and loss expense 56 115 167 Paid claims and expenses related to: Current accident year (1 ) (3 ) (1 ) Prior accident years (146 ) (165 ) (181 ) Total paid claims and expenses (147 ) (168 ) (182 ) Accrual for professional liability claims, end of year $ 572 $ 663 $ 716 ACCRUALS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS Our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts. The discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement. We evaluate this critical assumption annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Our discount rate for both 2009 and 2008 was 5.75%. The assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. A one hundred basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for 2010 by $1.1 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2009 by $25.9 million. A one hundred basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would increase net periodic pension expense for 2010 by $0.4 million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2009 by $21.9 million. ACCRUALS FOR LITIGATION LOSSES We record reserves for litigation losses if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss. If a range of loss can be reasonably estimated, but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. These estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS We evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. We calculate the amount of an impairment if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals, established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. The estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable. They require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates. These assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. We report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell. In such circumstances, our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows. 73 Table of Contents These fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods. Many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates, including the following risks: future financial results of our hospitals, which can be impacted by volumes of insured patients and declines in commercial managed care patients, terms of managed care payer arrangements, our ability to collect accounts due from uninsured and managed care payers, loss of volumes as a result of competition, and our ability to manage costs such as labor costs, which can be adversely impacted by union activity and the shortage of experienced nurses; changes in payments from governmental health care programs and in government regulations such as reductions to Medicare and Medicaid payment rates resulting from government legislation or rule making or from budgetary challenges of states in which we operate; how the hospitals are operated in the future; and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets. We recorded a net impairment charge of $7 million for one hospital during 2009 for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital, consistent with our prior estimates during 2008 when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. Unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying values of the long lived assets, this hospital is at risk of future impairments, particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate continues to decline. We also recorded a $10 million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the current campus of one hospital that is scheduled to move to a new, replacement campus during 2010. Our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from use of the current campus for several months during 2010 and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings at the current campus. We compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and, because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. Additionally, in our most recent impairment analysis as of December 31, 2009, we had two hospitals with an aggregate carrying value of long lived assets of approximately $164 million whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets by an aggregate amount of approximately $340 million. These two hospitals had the smallest excess of future estimated undiscounted cash flows over carrying value. Changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates of future undiscounted cash flows could result in the estimated cash flows being less than the carrying value of the assets, which would require a fair value assessment of the long lived assets, and if the fair value amount is less than the carrying value of the assets, impairment charges would occur and could be material. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually. For goodwill, we perform the test at the reporting unit level, as defined by applicable accounting standards, when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually. If we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired, or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value, then we reduce the carrying value, including any allocated goodwill, to fair value. Estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. 74 Table of Contents Our continuing operations are structured as follows: Our California region includes all of our hospitals in California and Nebraska; Our Central region includes all of our hospitals in Missouri, Tennessee and Texas; Our Florida region includes all of our hospitals in Florida; Our Southern States region includes all of our hospitals in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina; and Our two hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania are part of a separate market. These regions and market are reporting units used to perform our goodwill impairment analysis and are one level below our operating segment level. Future restructuring of our regions or markets that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill. Our goodwill balance is primarily related to our Southern States region, which totals approximately $287 million, and our Central region, which totals approximately $310 million. In our latest impairment analysis as of December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of these regions exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets, including goodwill, by approximately 17% and 53%, respectively. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities. Developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. We assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified, we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The main factors that we consider include: Cumulative losses in recent years, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items; Income/losses expected in future years; Unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels; The availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits; The carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities; and Prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the income tax valuation allowance decreased by $138 million primarily as a result of current year net income against which deferred tax assets were realized and the write off of deferred tax assets related to stock based compensation that would otherwise have been charged against additional paid in capital. As of December 31, 2009, we concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately $1.1 billion was required primarily as a result of negative evidence represented by cumulative losses during the three year period ended December 31, 2009. In 2009, our operating results improved considerably and, if our operating results continue to improve in 2010, we may no longer have cumulative losses for purposes of this analysis. In that case, our judgment about the need for a valuation allowance may change in the near term and, if so, some or all of the valuation allowance may be reduced and recorded as a benefit in income tax expense from continuing operations. We cannot predict at this time when or if the valuation allowance will be reduced. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions, and such judgments are subject to periodic review. Tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied; (2) the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired. Tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied. 75 Table of Contents While we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities, adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method, under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees, directors, advisors and consultants is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant, using a binomial lattice model. The key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include: Expected volatility; Expected dividend yield; Expected life; Expected forfeiture rate; Risk free interest rate range; Early exercise threshold; and Early exercise rate. The expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options. The expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options, and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges. The historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 due to unique events occurring during that time, which caused extreme volatility of our stock price. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. This model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price. The risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon United States Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes. The most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option, because it, in turn, is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates. Accordingly, we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date. Our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns. 76 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of December 31, 2009. The fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings with variable interest rates. Maturity Date, Years EndingDecember 31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Fair Value (Dollars in Millions) Fixed rate long term debt $ 2 $ 67 $ 58 $ 1,001 $ 100 $ 3,273 $ 4,501 $ 4,645 Average effective interest rates 8.9 % 6.8 % 6.8 % 7.8 % 10.3 % 10.5 % 9.8 % At December 31, 2009, we had long term, market sensitive investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries. Our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as non current assets is substantially mitigated by the long term nature and type of the investments in the portfolio. At December 31, 2009, the net accumulated unrealized losses related to our captive insurance companies investment portfolios were approximately $1 million. We have no affiliation with partnerships, trusts or other entities (sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities) whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements by us. Thus, we have no exposure to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risks associated with such entities. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. 77 Table of Contents
