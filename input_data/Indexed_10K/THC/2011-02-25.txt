ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The purpose of this section, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, is to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to better understand our business, to enhance our overall financial disclosures, to provide the context within which our financial information may be analyzed, and to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial and statistical information included herein relates to our continuing operations, with dollar amounts expressed in millions (except per share, per admission, per patient day and per visit amounts). This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. It includes the following sections: Management Overview Sources of Revenue Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Recently Issued Accounting Standards Critical Accounting Estimates MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS California Provider Fee Program Approved In January 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the final required federal approval of Californias program to impose a provider fee on hospitals that, combined with federal matching funds, will be used to provide supplemental Medi Cal payments to hospitals in the state. The program was enacted to provide supplemental Medi Cal payments for up to 21 months retroactive to April 2009 and expiring on December 31, 2010. Based on the most recent modeling prepared by the California Hospital Association, we estimate that revenues under the program, net of provider fees and other expenses, for our California hospitals will be approximately $64 million for the full 21 month period of the plan. We will recognize the approximately $64 million of net revenues in the three months ending March 31, 2011. STRATEGY AND TRENDS We are committed to providing the communities our hospitals and other health care facilities serve with high quality, cost effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long term value for our shareholders. We believe that our success in increasing our profitability depends in part on our success in executing the following strategies and managing the following trends. 28 Table of Contents Core Business Strategy At December 31, 2010, our subsidiaries operated 49 general hospitals, including four academic medical centers, and a critical access hospital, with a combined total of 13,428 licensed beds, serving primarily urban and suburban communities in 11 states. Our core business is focused on providing acute care treatment, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, radiology services and emergency medical treatment. In supporting our core business, we seek to offer superior quality and patient services, to make capital and other investments in our facilities and technology to be competitive, to recruit and retain physicians, and to negotiate favorable contracts with managed care and other commercial payers. In addition, we continually review our clinical service lines to determine which services are most highly valued and should be marketed to improve our operating results, and we strategically de emphasize or eliminate unprofitable service lines, if appropriate. Commitment to Quality Through our Commitment to Quality initiative and Medicare Performance Initiative, we continually work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care, while using labor management tools and supply chain initiatives to reduce variable costs. We believe the use of these practices will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay, as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients. As a result of our efforts, our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care. Leveraging off of these initiatives, we expect to benefit over time from provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act) that tie payments to quality measures, establish a value based purchasing system and adjust hospital payment rates based on hospital acquired conditions and hospital readmissions. In general, we believe that quality of care improvements may have the effect of reducing costs, increasing payments from Medicare and certain managed care payers for our services, and increasing physician and patient satisfaction, which may potentially improve our volumes. Development Strategies We continue to focus on opportunities to increase our outpatient revenues through organic growth and the acquisition of selected outpatient businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we derived approximately 32% of our revenues from outpatient services. Historically, our outpatient business has generated significantly higher margins for us than other business lines. By expanding our outpatient business, we expect to increase our profitability over time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired various outpatient centers in California, Florida, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. We also intend to focus on acquiring hospitals and other health care assets and companies in markets where we believe our operating strategies can improve performance and create shareholder value. We believe that this growth by strategic acquisition, when and if opportunities are available, can supplement the growth we believe we can generate organically in our existing markets. Impact of Affordable Care Act We anticipate that we will benefit over time from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that will extend insurance coverage through Medicaid or private insurance to a broader segment of the U.S. population. Although we are unable to predict the precise impact of the Affordable Care Act on our future results of operations, and while there will be some reductions in reimbursement rates, which began in 2010, we anticipate, based on the current timetable for implementing the law, that we could begin to receive reimbursement for caring for uninsured and underinsured patients as early as 2014. We believe we are well positioned relative to other health care companies to benefit from extended insurance coverage given the concentration of our operations in California, Florida and Texas, which states historically have higher percentages of uninsured and underinsured patients compared to the national average. Capturing HIT Incentive Payments and Other Benefits Based on our current timeframe for achieving compliance with the health information technology (HIT) requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), we expect that the operating costs we currently are incurring to invest in HIT systems will be partially offset beginning in 2012 as we begin to receive Medicare and Medicaid hospital incentive payments provided under ARRA. Moreover, we believe that the operational benefits of HIT, including improved clinical outcomes and increased operating efficiencies, will contribute to our long term ability to grow our business. Counteracting Declines in Patient Volumes We continue to experience declines in patient volumes because of the impact of the current economic downturn, increased competition, utilization pressure by managed care organizations and demographic trends. In an effort to increase patient volumes, we continue to focus on physician alignment and satisfaction, targeting our capital spending on critical growth opportunities for our hospitals, emphasizing higher demand clinical service lines (including outpatient lines), implementing new payer contracting strategies, and improving the quality metrics of our hospitals. General Economic Conditions We believe that the economic downturn continues to have a negative impact on our bad debt expense levels and patient volumes, reflecting the impact of current high unemployment rates and other depressed economic conditions. However, as the economy recovers, we expect to experience an improvement in these metrics relative to current levels. 29 Table of Contents Expanding Our Revenue Cycle Management Business We intend to continue expanding our revenue cycle management and patient communications services businesses under our Conifer Health Solutions (Conifer) subsidiary. At December 31, 2010, Conifer provided revenue cycle services to approximately 30 non Tenet hospitals. We believe this business has the potential over time to generate higher margins and improve our results of operations. Our ability to execute on these strategies and manage these trends is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from expectations. For information about these risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide and company specific challenges, including decreased volumes, decreased demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt, that have affected our revenue growth and operating expenses. We believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect recent trends we are experiencing with respect to volumes, revenues and expenses; therefore, we have provided below information about these metrics for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 for all of our continuing operations hospitals. Three Months EndedDecember 31, Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Total admissions 126,977 129,631 (2.0 )% Paying admissions (excludes charity and uninsured) 118,583 121,239 (2.2 )% Charity and uninsured admissions 8,394 8,392 % Admissions through emergency department 74,648 74,778 (0.2 )% Paying admissions as a percentage of total admissions 93.4 % 93.5 % (0.1 )%(1) Charity and uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions 6.6 % 6.5 % 0.1 %(1) Emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions 58.8 % 57.7 % 1.1 %(1) Surgeries inpatient 37,448 38,126 (1.8 )% Surgeries outpatient 52,411 52,344 0.1 % Total surgeries 89,859 90,470 (0.7 )% Patient days total 608,890 628,438 (3.1 )% Adjusted patient days(2) 923,219 930,542 (0.8 )% Average length of stay (days) 4.8 4.8 (1) Adjusted patient admissions(2) 194,099 193,279 0.4 % (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. (2) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Total admissions declined by 2,654, or 2.0%, in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. Three of our four regions and our Philadelphia market reported admissions declines in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. Surgeries declined by 0.7% in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. While our emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions increased 1.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year, we believe the current economic conditions have had an adverse impact on the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals, which contributed to the overall decline in our total admissions. Furthermore, there were 153 flu related admissions in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 666 in the same period in 2009, a decline of 77%. 30 Table of Contents Three Months EndedDecember 31, Outpatient Visits 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Total visits 999,827 971,741 2.9 % Paying visits (excludes charity and uninsured) 900,182 872,228 3.2 % Charity and uninsured visits 99,645 99,513 0.1 % Emergency department visits 359,168 364,663 (1.5 )% Surgery visits 52,411 52,344 0.1 % Paying visits as a percentage of total visits 90.0 % 89.8 % 0.2 %(1) Charity and uninsured visits as a percentage of total visits 10.0 % 10.2 % (0.2 )%(1) (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. We had an increase of 28,086 total outpatient visits, or 2.9%, in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. Our California, Central and Florida regions reported increased outpatient visits, while our Southern States region and our Philadelphia market reported declines in outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2010. The increase in Florida region visits is primarily attributable to the various outpatient centers we acquired in September 2010. Outpatient surgery visits increased by 0.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. Charity and uninsured outpatient visits increased by 0.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. Three Months EndedDecember 31, Revenues 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues $ 2,301 $ 2,261 1.8 % Revenues from the uninsured $ 154 $ 152 1.3 % Net inpatient revenues(1) $ 1,477 $ 1,481 (0.3 )% Net outpatient revenues(1) $ 730 $ 691 5.6 % (1) Net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues. Net inpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $66 million and $61 for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net outpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $88 million and $91 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net operating revenues increased by $40 million, or 1.8%, for the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. Unfavorable prior year cost report adjustments of approximately $3 million reduced net operating revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to favorable adjustments of $6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2009. Primarily as a result of managed care pricing improvement, including a 1.9% increase in our commercial inpatient acuity and a favorable shift in managed care payer mix, as well as a 2.9% increase in outpatient visits, net patient revenues increased by 1.6% despite the 2.0% decline in total admissions in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. Three Months EndedDecember 31, Revenues on a Per Admission, Per Patient Day and Per Visit Basis 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Net inpatient revenue per admission $ 11,632 $ 11,425 1.8 % Net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 2,426 $ 2,357 2.9 % Net outpatient revenue per visit $ 730 $ 711 2.7 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient admission(1) $ 11,370 $ 11,238 1.2 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient day(1) $ 2,391 $ 2,334 2.4 % (1) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. 31 Table of Contents Unit revenue improvement was evident across all key metrics, primarily reflecting the improved terms of our managed care contracts and the provision of higher acuity services in the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The growth in net inpatient revenue per admission of 1.8% was constrained by an unfavorable shift in our total payer mix, including a decline in managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. Three Months EndedDecember 31, Selected Operating Expenses 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Salaries, wages and benefits $ 967 $ 989 (2.2 )% Supplies 394 394 % Other operating expenses 468 479 (2.3 )% Total $ 1,829 $ 1,862 (1.8 )% Rent/lease expense(1) $ 35 $ 38 (7.9 )% Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day(2) $ 1,047 $ 1,063 (1.5 )% Supplies per adjusted patient day(2) 427 423 0.9 % Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day(2) 507 $ 515 (1.6 )% Total per adjusted patient day $ 1,981 $ 2,001 (1.0 )% (1) Included in other operating expenses. (2) Adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Total selected operating expenses, which is defined as salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses, decreased by 1.0% on a per adjusted patient day basis in the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day decreased by 1.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. This decrease is primarily due to decreased accruals for annual incentive compensation and discretionary contribution expense of $16 million in the 2009 period for contributions to the 401(k) plan accounts of employees who were not eligible for incentive compensation awards, partially offset by an increase in health benefits costs. Supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by 0.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. Supplies expense was unfavorably impacted by the increased use of prostheses and high cost implants, partially offset by decreases in the cost of pacemakers and pharmaceuticals. A portion of the increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day decreased by 1.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease is primarily due to a $21 million decrease in malpractice expense, a favorable adjustment of $10 million relating to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents and reductions in consulting costs, property taxes and rent expense as compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in malpractice expense is significantly attributable to an 80 basis point increase in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities, which resulted in a $10 million reduction in malpractice expense in the three months ended December 31, 2010, and improved claims experience. These decreases were partially offset by the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage, increases in the costs of repairs, maintenance and technology service contracts, increased physician relocation costs, increased physician and medical fees, a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations, increased costs of contracted services, increased advertising expenses and increased hospital provider taxes, which were substantially offset by additional disproportionate share hospital payments recognized in revenues. 32 Table of Contents Three Months EndedDecember 31, Provision for Doubtful Accounts 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Provision for doubtful accounts $ 191 $ 181 5.5 % Provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues 8.3 % 8.0 % 0.3 %(1) Collection rate on self pay accounts(2) 28.3 % 30.1 % (1.8 )%(1) Collection rate from managed care payers 98.4 % 98.0 % 0.4 %(1) (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009. (2) Self pay accounts receivable are comprised of both uninsured and balance after insurance receivables. Provision for doubtful accounts increased by $10 million, or 5.5%, in the three months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in provision for doubtful accounts primarily related to a 180 basis point decline in our collection rate on self pay accounts, increased self pay revenues and higher pricing. Our self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 28.3% as of December 31, 2010 from 30.1% as of December 31, 2009. The estimated direct and allocated costs (based on selected operating expenses, which include salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses) of caring for uninsured patients were $91 million and $93 million in the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The table below shows the pre tax and after tax impact on continuing operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of the following items: Three Months EndedDecember 31 Years EndedDecember 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 (Expense) Income Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges $ (9 ) $ (14 ) $ (10 ) $ (27 ) Litigation and investigation costs (6 ) (18 ) (12 ) (31 ) Gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt (2 ) (57 ) 97 Gain on sales of investments 15 Pre tax impact $ (17 ) $ (32 ) $ (79 ) $ 54 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance and other tax adjustments $ 23 $ 33 $ 1,043 $ 110 Total after tax impact $ 9 $ 12 $ 993 $ 144 Diluted per share impact of above items $ 0.02 $ 0.03 $ 1.78 $ 0.28 Diluted earnings per share, including above items $ 0.10 $ 0.03 $ 2.01 $ 0.43 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Cash and cash equivalents were $405 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $7 million from $398 million at September 30, 2010. Significant cash flow items in the three months ended December 31, 2010 included: Interest payments of $89 million; Capital expenditures of $196 million; and $46 million aggregate cash proceeds from the sale of nine medical office buildings in Florida. 33 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was $472 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $425 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the 2010 and 2009 periods include the following: Increased income from continuing operations before income taxes of $68 million, excluding net gain on sales of investments, investment earnings (loss), gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, interest expense, litigation and investigation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, and depreciation and amortization in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009; Lower interest payments of $37 million, primarily due to $23 million of interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of our exchange of approximately $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 63/8% senior notes due 2011 and our 61/2% senior notes due 2012 for new senior secured notes and other subsequent debt repurchases with the proceeds from our issuance of preferred stock and cash on hand that reduced our outstanding debt, as well as payments made as a result of our then existing interest rate swap agreement, which we terminated in November 2009; Lower aggregate annual 401(k) matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of $18 million ($105 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $123 million in the year ended December 31, 2009); Net income tax refunds of $34 million received in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to net income tax payments of $43 million in the year ended December 31, 2009; Lower payments on reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs of $109 million, primarily due to $81 million of payments in the year ended December 31, 2009 related to our settlement of wage and hour actions; $40 million less cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations, principally due to accounts receivable collections in the prior year related to divested hospitals; Reduced cash flows of $175 million primarily due to the payment of additional accounts payable at December 31, 2009, other changes in working capital and changes in long term liabilities, including the following: a $105 million reduction in our professional and general liability reserves primarily due to improved claims experience and claim payments; a $27 million receivable recorded in 2010 for Medicare bad debts that we have claimed or will claim on our Medicare cost reports, a substantial portion of which is expected to be collected in 2011; and a $10 million receivable recorded in 2010 that we expect to collect in 2011 relating to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid by us prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents; and $39 million we received in the year ended December 31, 2009 under our then existing interest rate swap agreement, which we terminated in November 2009. SOURCES OF REVENUE We receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources, primarily managed care payers and the federal Medicare program, as well as state Medicaid programs, indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients (that is, patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement). The table below shows the sources of net patient revenues for our general hospitals, expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources: Years Ended December 31, Net Patient Revenues from: 2010 2009 2008 Medicare 23.9 % 25.0 % 25.5 % Medicaid 8.7 % 8.1 % 8.4 % Managed care 56.5 % 56.1 % 54.8 % Indemnity, self pay and other 10.9 % 10.8 % 11.3 % 34 Table of Contents Our payer mix on an admissions basis for our general hospitals, expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources, is shown below: Years Ended December 31, Admissions from: 2010 2009 2008 Medicare 29.9 % 30.0 % 30.9 % Medicaid 13.0 % 12.3 % 12.3 % Managed care 47.6 % 48.5 % 47.8 % Indemnity, self pay and other 9.5 % 9.2 % 9.0 % GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS The Medicare program, the nations largest health insurance program, is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals 65 years of age and older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with end stage renal disease, and is provided without regard to income or assets. Medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources, and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nations poor and most vulnerable individuals. As enacted, the Affordable Care Act will change how health care services under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs are covered, delivered and reimbursed. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expands eligibility under existing Medicaid programs to non pregnant adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning in 2014. Further, the law permits states to create federally funded, non Medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for Medicaid. However, the Affordable Care Act also contains a number of provisions designed to significantly reduce Medicare and Medicaid program spending, including: (1) negative adjustments to the annual market basket updates for Medicare inpatient, outpatient, long term acute and inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment systems, which began in 2010, as well as additional productivity adjustments beginning in 2011; and (2) reductions to Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in 2013 as the number of uninsured individuals declines. We are unable to predict with certainty the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the laws complexity, the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual or potentially delayed implementation, pending court challenges and possible amendment. However, we expect that several provisions of the Affordable Care Act will have a material effect on our business. In addition to the changes affected by the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to other statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future, as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced, if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited, or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government health care program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents Medicare Medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits. One option, the Original Medicare Plan, is a fee for service payment system. The other option, called Medicare Advantage, includes health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, private fee for service Medicare special needs plans and Medicare medical savings account plans. The major components of our net patient revenues for services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are set forth in the table below: Years Ended December 31, Revenue Descriptions 2010 2009 2008 Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group operating $ 1,171 $ 1,191 $ 1,170 Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group capital 106 109 109 Outlier 51 68 66 Outpatient 453 421 378 Disproportionate share 215 219 211 Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education(1) 110 111 110 Other(2) 53 76 92 Adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances (15 ) 10 4 Total Medicare net patient revenues $ 2,144 $ 2,205 $ 2,140 (1) Includes Indirect Medical Education (IME) revenue earned by our childrens hospital under the Childrens Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment Program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration of HHS. (2) The other revenue category includes one skilled nursing facility (which we sold in the three months ended June 30, 2009), inpatient psychiatric units, one inpatient rehabilitation hospital (which we closed in the three months ended March 31, 2009), inpatient rehabilitation units, one long term acute care hospital, other revenue adjustments, and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances. A general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan is provided below. Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found below under Regulatory and Legislative Changes. Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System Medicare Severity Adjusted Diagnosis Related Group Payments Sections 1886(d) and 1886(g) of the Social Security Act (the Act) set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system (PPS). Under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), Medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge. Discharges are classified according to a system of Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups (MS DRGs), which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources. CMS assigns to each MS DRG a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular MS DRG, relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all MS DRGs. The base payment amount for the operating component of the MS DRG payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share. Both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs, respectively. Using diagnosis and procedure information submitted by the hospital, CMS assigns to each discharge an MS DRG, and the base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the MS DRG assigned. The MS DRG operating and capital base rates, relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually, with consideration given to: the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals; the relative costs associated with each MS DRG; and changes in labor data by geographic area. Although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials, the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospitals operating and capital costs. Outlier Payments Outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals on individual claims for treating Medicare patients whose medical conditions are costlier to treat than those of the average patient in the same MS DRG. To qualify for a cost outlier payment, a hospitals billed charges, adjusted to cost, must exceed the payment rate for the MS DRG by a fixed threshold established annually by CMS. A Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) (formerly known as a Medicare fiscal intermediary) calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospitals most recently filed cost report. Generally, if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the MS DRG payment plus the fixed threshold, the hospital receives 80% of the difference as an outlier payment. Under the Act, CMS must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all PPS hospitals to be not less than 5% or more than 6% of total MS DRG payments (Outlier Percentage). The Outlier Percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of MS DRG and outlier payments. CMS annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit. A change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing: (1) the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments; and (2) the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify for outlier payments. 36 Table of Contents Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients. Disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by CMS and are calculated as a percentage add on to the MS DRG payments. During 2010, 42 of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for DSH payments. The primary method for a hospital to qualify for DSH payments is based on a complex statutory formula that results in a DSH percentage that is applied to payments based on MS DRGs. The hospital specific DSH percentage is equal to the sum of the percentage of Medicare inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for both the Traditional Medicare Plan (Part A) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) percentage, and the percentage of total inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for Medicaid but not Medicare Part A. Hospitals receive interim DSH payments that are reconciled in the annual cost report. CMS develops and distributes the hospital specific SSI percentages, typically one year after the close of the federal fiscal year (FFY); however, the release of the SSI percentages has been delayed in recent years as CMS continues to examine and refine the data. Historically, the SSI percentage included only patient days paid under Part A. However, the FFY 2007 SSI percentages CMS released in June 2009 reflect a policy change to include the Medicare Advantage (Part C) days in the ratio. The 2007 SSI percentages will be used to settle our 2007 cost reports. As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $23 million as our initial estimate of the impact of using the FFY 2007 SSI ratios. During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we learned that CMS had instructed the MACs to suspend the settlement of all cost reports (including ours) in which the 2007 SSI percentages would be used. However, the MACs are authorized to use the 2007 SSI percentages for current DSH interim payments and tentative settlements for post 2007 cost reporting periods pending the release of revised 2007 SSI percentages and the 2008 and subsequent SSI percentages. The cost report settlement suspension is still in effect, and we cannot predict with certainty when the suspension will be removed. During the three months ended June 30, 2010, CMS released additional data regarding the FFY 2007 SSI percentages specifically, the Part C days included in the FFY 2007 SSI ratios released in June 2009. In addition, CMS issued a notice to hospitals indicating that, based on the agencys review of the data, it appeared that a significant number of non teaching hospitals nationwide had not submitted Part C claims for FFYs 2007 and 2008 to the Medicare Part A contractor. Part C claims are submitted to the Medicare Advantage payer for payment; however, CMS requires hospitals to submit a no pay or shadow bill to the Medicare Part A contractor. The notice instructed all non teaching hospitals to submit the Part C no pay claims for FFYs 2007 and 2008 to the Medicare Part A contractor by August 31, 2010, and submit an attestation of compliance with the requirement by September 15, 2010. We submitted the Part C no pay claims and attestations of compliance by the respective deadlines. CMS has not yet released the FFYs 2008 and 2009 SSI ratios and, according to the CMS website, revised FFYs 2007 and 2008 SSI ratios that will include the Part C data will not be released until later in FFY 2011. Despite a recent federal court decision that invalidates the inclusion of the Part C days in the SSI ratios, CMS has not indicated it intends to change its policy in this regard. As a result, in the three months ended June 30, 2010, we revised our estimate of the impact of using the FFY 2007 SSI ratios for the calculation of Medicare DSH payments for our non teaching hospitals for 2007 and subsequent periods to reflect the inclusion of the estimated Part C days in the FFY 2007 SSI ratios, and we recorded an unfavorable adjustment to Medicare net revenue of $20 million ($14 million related to prior years and $6 million related to the year ended December 31, 2010). We intend to continue to pursue a reversal of CMS policy in this regard through the administrative and judicial appeal process; however, we cannot predict the outcome or timing of the appeals. The Medicare DSH statutes and regulations have been the subject of various administrative appeals and lawsuits, and our hospitals have been included in these appeals for several years. These types of appeals generally take several years to resolve, in particular for multi hospital organizations, because of CMS administrative appeal rules. The appeals have been further delayed due to CMS general moratorium on the release of information critical to certain elements of these appeals. Although a recent federal court decision regarding a DSH appeal brought by another plaintiff was favorable, we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the DSH appeals for our hospitals. A favorable outcome of our appeals could have a material impact on our future revenues and cash flows. Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education The Medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions. This additional reimbursement, which is subject to certain limits, including intern and resident full time equivalent (FTE) limits established in 1996, is made in the form of Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education payments. During 2010, 13 of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments. Medicare rules permit teaching hospitals to enter into Medicare Graduate Medical Education Affiliation Agreements for the purpose of applying the FTE limits on an aggregate basis, and some of our teaching hospitals have entered into such agreements. We were previously contacted by CMS in connection with DGME FTE limits and related reimbursement at Doctors Medical Center in Modesto, California as a result of our 1997 transaction with a county owned hospital in Modesto and the IME and DGME residency program sponsored by the county. We replied to CMS that, based on our analysis of the transaction and the applicable CMS rules, we believe that the DGME FTE limits and related reimbursement reported on the hospitals cost reports were substantially correct. In January 2008, CMS preliminarily advised us that they disagree with our analysis. During the three months ended September 30, 2008, we received notices from our MAC of its intent to reopen certain cost reports in connection with this matter. We have since received settlement notices for the hospitals 2001 through 2007 cost reporting periods that reflect a disallowance of all of the hospitals IME and DGME payments, and the hospitals 2008 and 2009 cost reports were filed 37 Table of Contents consistent with the MACs disallowance on the prior year cost reports. Additionally, the MAC ceased making IME and DGME interim payments to the hospital from June 2008 until July 2010, when a newly accredited program (as described below) became eligible for reimbursement. Although we have formally challenged CMS decision to disallow the IME and DGME funding for prior periods, it could take several years to resolve this issue and the outcome is uncertain at this time. As a result, in the three months ended June 30, 2008, we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $17 million ($16 million related to 2007 and prior years and $1 million related to the year ended December 31, 2008), and we did not record any IME or DGME revenue for this hospital through June 30, 2010. CMS recently revised certain of its policies regarding the eligibility of teaching programs for Medicare IME and DGME reimbursement. In January 2010, the program sponsored by the county, Doctors Medical Center and other hospitals obtained accreditation and other approvals effective for the academic year beginning July 1, 2010 for a new residency program that we believe will satisfy CMS requirements for reimbursement. On September 24, 2010, our MAC approved interim payment rates for DGME and IME reimbursement to Doctors Medical Center retroactive to July 1, 2010. Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Under the outpatient prospective payment system, hospital outpatient services, except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule, are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (APCs). Services in each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require, and a payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, hospitals may be paid for more than one APC for an encounter. CMS periodically updates the APCs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each APC. Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System The inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system (IPF PPS) applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system. The IPF PPS is based on prospectively determined per diem rates and includes an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases. Inpatient Rehabilitation Prospective Payment System Rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by CMS are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) under the IRF prospective payment system (IRF PPS). Payments under the IRF PPS are made on a per discharge basis. A patient classification system is used to assign patients in IRFs into case mix groups. The IRF PPS uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups. To be paid under the IRF PPS, each hospital or unit must demonstrate on an annual basis that at least 60% of its total population had either a principal or secondary diagnosis that fell within one or more of the qualifying conditions designated in the Medicare regulations governing IRFs. As of December 31, 2010, all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required 60% threshold. Cost Reports The final determination of certain Medicare payments to our hospitals, such as DSH, DGME, IME and bad debt expense, are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports. The final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal, and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. For filed cost reports, we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. Typically, the MACs settle cost reports within two years after the end of the cost reporting period; however, due to the aforementioned CMS suspension of issuing cost report settlements nationwide, our Medicare cost reports for periods ended on or after December 31, 2007 have not yet been settled. We cannot predict when CMS will remove the settlement suspension. Medicaid Medicaid programs and the corresponding reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year. Estimated payments under various state Medicaid programs, excluding state funded managed care Medicaid programs, constituted approximately 8.7%, 8.1% and 8.4% of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also receive DSH payments under various state Medicaid programs. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our revenues attributable to DSH payments and other state funded subsidy payments were approximately $181 million, $171 million and $153 million, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Because most states must operate with balanced budgets, and the Medicaid program is generally a significant portion of a states budget, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting future legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic downturn has increased the budgeting pressures on most states, and these budgeting pressures have resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending for Medicaid programs in many states. Most states began a new fiscal year on July 1, 2010 and, although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets, some states are facing mid year budget gaps. Mid year budget gaps, increased Medicaid enrollment due to the economic downturn, limits on the ability of states to reduce Medicaid eligibility criteria enacted as part of Affordable Care Act and other factors could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments or additional taxes on hospitals. Some states are considering proposals that would result in such reductions. As an alternative means of funding provider payments, several states in which we operate have adopted or are considering adopting broad based provider taxes to fund the non federal share of Medicaid programs. Some states, such as California, as described below, have introduced provider fee arrangements, which enhance rather than reduce funding available to providers. Because we cannot predict what actions the federal government or the states may take under existing legislation and future legislation to address budget gaps or deficits, or implement provider tax or fee arrangements, we are unable to assess the effect that any such legislation might have on our business, but the impact on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be material. Medicaid related patient revenues recognized by our continuing general hospitals in each state for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are set forth in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Medicaid ManagedMedicaid Medicaid ManagedMedicaid Medicaid ManagedMedicaid Florida $ 194 $ 55 $ 182 $ 56 $ 167 $ 45 California 137 111 125 99 133 79 Georgia 87 40 73 41 83 34 Missouri 81 6 75 6 73 6 Texas 66 109 67 107 52 85 South Carolina 61 20 52 17 49 4 Pennsylvania 53 161 53 157 56 137 Alabama 26 14 23 North Carolina 26 27 25 Nebraska 24 6 23 6 25 5 Tennessee 9 27 9 30 8 23 $ 764 $ 535 $ 700 $ 519 $ 694 $ 418 In October 2009, the Governor of California signed legislation supported by the hospital industry to impose a provider fee on general acute care hospitals that, combined with federal matching funds, would be used to provide supplemental Medi Cal payments to hospitals, as well as provide the state with $320 million annually for childrens health care coverage. The hospital fee program created by this legislation was enacted to provide these payments for up to 21 months retroactive to April 2009 and expiring on December 31, 2010. The state submitted the plan to CMS for a required review and approval, and on October 7, 2010, CMS approved the fee for service portion of the program. On January 18, 2011, CMS issued the final required federal approval of the program. Based on the most recent modeling prepared by the California Hospital Association (CHA), the program will result in additional revenue for our hospitals, net of provider fees and other expenses, of approximately $64 million. We will recognize the $64 million during the three months ending March 31, 2011 because CMS did not issue the final required federal approval of the program until January 18, 2011. The final net revenue we receive is subject to receipts from managed care plans, which are due during the three months ending March 31, 2011, and collection of 100% of the fees due from California hospitals, substantially all of which were collected as of December 31, 2010; however, we do not expect the final net revenue that we will recognize in connection with the program to materially differ from our estimates. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we made periodic installment 39 Table of Contents payments totaling $129 million of our required payments of $134 million under the program. Also during the three months ended December 31, 2010, we received $138 million in fee for service supplemental proceeds of the aggregate $198 million fee for service and managed care proceeds that we expect to collect. We anticipate making the remaining $5 million of our required payments and receiving approximately $60 million in additional supplemental proceeds during the three months ending March 31, 2011. The net $9 million of supplemental proceeds received in excess of fees paid during the three months ended December 31, 2010 is considered deferred income and classified as a current liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010. Additional legislation to extend the California hospital fee program to coincide with the extension of the increased Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage through June 30, 2011 will be required and is currently under development. Based on the most recent CHA model, the extension of the fee program for the six months ending June 30, 2011 could result in approximately $28 million of net revenues for our California hospitals in 2011. We cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate, the approval of the six month program by CMS or the passage of the legislation to extend the fee program. 40 Table of Contents Regulatory and Legislative Changes Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems are provided below. Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System Under Medicare law, CMS is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system. These updates generally become effective October 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. On July 30, 2010, CMS issued the Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and Fiscal Year 2011 Rates (Final Rule). The Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes effective for discharges on or after October 1, 2010: A net market basket increase of 2.35%, which includes a full market basket increase of 2.6% minus the 0.25% reduction required by the Affordable Care Act for MS DRG operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data; hospitals that successfully report quality measures included in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) program will receive the 2.35% update for 2011; hospitals that do not participate in the quality reporting program will receive an update of 0.35%; A net increase of 1.25% for MS DRG capital payments, which includes a capital update increase of 1.5% minus the 0.25% reduction as called for by the Affordable Care Act for MS DRG capital payments; An additional reduction of 2.9% to the operating and capital rate updates to recoup 50% of the estimated overpayments in FFYs 2008 and 2009 due to hospital coding and documentation processes in connection with the transition to MS DRGs; 41 Table of Contents A decrease in the cost outlier threshold from $23,135 to $23,075; and The addition of 12 new quality measures to the HIQR program and the retirement of one measure (10 of the new measures will be considered in determining a hospitals FFY 2012 update; the remaining two measures to be reported in 2011 will be considered in a hospitals FFY 2013 update). CMS projects that the combined effect of all changes included in the Final Rule will result in an average 0.4% decrease in payments to hospitals located in large urban areas (populations over one million). Using a 0.4% reduction as applied to our IPPS payments for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010, the estimated impact of the payment changes in the Final Rule is a decrease in our annual Medicare inpatient net revenues of approximately $5 million. Because of the uncertainty of factors that may influence our IPPS payments by individual hospital, including admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate. On May 21, 2010, CMS issued a notice implementing certain statutory measures included in the Affordable Care Act that effect the FFY 2010 IPPS payments (FFY 2010 Notice), including the FFY 2010 0.25% market basket reduction. The market basket adjustment applies to discharges on or after April 1, 2010 and before October 1, 2010. Although CMS projects that the combined effect of all changes included in the FFY 2010 Notice will result in a 0.1% increase in current FFY 2010 payments to hospitals located in large urban areas (populations over one million), the impact includes a 0.3% increase related to an extension of geographic adjustments for which our hospitals do not qualify. As a result, we estimate that our revised IPPS rates will be reduced by 0.2% effective April 1, 2010. Using a 0.2% reduction as applied to our IPPS payments for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010, the estimated impact of the payment changes in the FFY 2010 Notice is a decrease in our annual Medicare inpatient net revenues of approximately $3 million. Because of the uncertainty of factors that may influence our IPPS payments by individual hospital, including admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate. Payment Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System On July 16, 2010, CMS issued a notice updating the prospective payment rates for the Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System for FFY 2011 (IRF PPS Rate Notice). The IRF PPS Rate Notice includes the following payment changes: A net payment increase for IRFs of 2.16%, which reflects a 2.5% market basket increase minus a 0.25% reduction as called for under the Affordable Care Act; and An increase in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from $10,652 to $11,410. At December 31, 2010, nine of our general hospitals operated inpatient rehabilitation units. CMS projects that the payment changes in the IRF PPS Rate Notice will result in an estimated total increase in aggregate IRF payments of $135 million, or 2.16% of total IRF PPS payments. This estimated increase includes an average 2.20% increase for rehabilitation units in urban areas for FFY 2011. Using the urban rehabilitation unit impact percentage as applied to our Medicare IRF payments for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010, the annual impact of the payment changes in the IRF PPS Rate Notice may result in an estimated increase in our Medicare revenues of approximately $1 million. Because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future IRF payments, including legislative action, admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, as well as the impact of compliance with IRF admission criteria, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes. Payment Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System On April 29, 2010, CMS issued a Notice of the Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Facility (IPF) Prospective Payment System Update for the rate year beginning July 1, 2010 (IPF PPS Notice). The IPF PPS Notice includes the following payment changes: An update to IPF payments equal to the market basket of 2.4%, minus the 0.25% reduction as called for by the Affordable Care Act; and A decrease in the fixed dollar loss threshold amount for outlier payments from $6,565 to $6,372. At December 31, 2010, 11 of our general hospitals operated inpatient psychiatric units. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment changes will yield an average 2.26% increase in payments for all IPFs (including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals), and an average 2.29% increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas. Using 42 Table of Contents the urban psychiatric unit impact percentage as applied to our Medicare IPF payments for the 12 months ended June 30, 2010, the annual impact of all payment changes on our psychiatric units may result in an estimated increase in our Medicare revenues of approximately $1 million. On January 27, 2011, CMS issued a proposed rule for the rate year beginning July 1, 2011 (IPF PPS Proposed Rule). The IPF PPS Proposed Rule includes the following payment and policy proposals: A change to the IPF payment rate update period to a rate year that coincides with the FFY effective October 1, 2011; and An update to IPF payments equal to the market basket of 3% for the proposed 15 month rate year period minus the 0.25% reduction as called for by the Affordable Care Act. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes included in the IPF PPS Proposed Rule will yield an average 2.54% increase in payments for all IPFs (including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals), and an average 2.23% increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas. Using the urban psychiatric unit impact percentage as applied to our Medicare IPF payments for the six months ended December 31, 2010, the annual impact of all proposed payment changes in the IPF PPS Proposed Rule on our psychiatric units may result in an estimated increase in our Medicare revenues of approximately $1 million. Because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future IPF payments, including future legislation, admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimates of the impact of the aforementioned changes. Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System On November 2, 2010, CMS released the Changes to the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and Calendar Year 2011 Payment Rates (OPPS Rule). The OPPS Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: A net update to OPPS payments equal to the estimated market basket of 2.35%, which takes into account a 0.25% reduction mandated by the Affordable Care Act; hospitals that did not take part in the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program or that did not successfully report their quality measures will have their update reduced by two percentage points; Finalization of the measures, addressing emergency department and imaging efficiency, as well as health information technology capabilities in the hospital outpatient setting, required for the hospital outpatient quality reporting program for 2012 and 2013 payment determinations; Implementing policies for the changes passed in the Affordable Care Act related to physician self referral and the whole hospital exception (the OPPS Rule affirms the December 31, 2010 deadline for new facilities to have physician investment and a Medicare provider agreement in place); and Substantial revisions to CMS physician supervision policy that: (1) eliminate the requirement that a supervising physician must be on the same campus or in the off campus provider based department of the hospital; (2) identify a limited set of non surgical, extended duration therapeutic services for which direct supervision is required only for initiation of the service, followed by a general supervision requirement for the remainder of such service; and (3) announce the agencys intent to establish an independent review process for evaluating the appropriate level of physician supervision for specific therapeutic services in the calendar year 2012 OPPS rulemaking cycle. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the OPPS Rule will yield an average 2.5% increase in payments for all hospitals and an average 2.9% increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas (populations over one million). According to CMS estimates, the projected annual impact of the payment and policy changes in the OPPS Rule on our hospitals is an $8 million increase in Medicare outpatient revenues. Because of uncertainty regarding factors that may influence our future OPPS payments, including volumes, case mix and physician supervision requirements, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. 43 Table of Contents Affordable Care Act As enacted, the Affordable Care Act will change how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth and other reductions in Medicare program spending, and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. In addition, a disproportionately large percentage of the new Medicaid coverage is likely to be in states that currently have relatively low income eligibility requirements. Two such states are Florida and Texas, where nearly half of our licensed beds are currently located. On the other hand, the Affordable Care Act provides for significant reductions in Medicare market basket updates and reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments. Given that approximately 32.6% of our revenues in 2010 were from Medicare and Medicaid, reductions to these programs may significantly impact us and could offset any positive effects of the Affordable Care Act. We are unable to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the laws complexity and the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, as well as our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the law. Furthermore, many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until 2014 or later. In addition, the Affordable Care Act will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with new federal mandates, such as the requirement to establish health insurance exchanges and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities, and we are unable to predict the timing and impact of such changes at this time. It is also possible that implementation of the Affordable Care Act could be delayed or even blocked due to court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the law. Because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of (1) the expected increases in volumes and revenues and decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals, (2) the reductions in Medicare spending, (3) the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH funding, and (4) numerous other provisions in the Affordable Care Act legislation that may affect us. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was enacted by Congress and signed into law by the President in February 2009 to stimulate the U.S. economy. The law created federal tax incentives, expanded unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions, and increased domestic spending on education, infrastructure and health care, including $31 billion in new spending on health information technology, most of which is for incentive Medicare and Medicaid payments to physicians and hospitals. ARRA requires that hospitals and physicians become meaningful users of electronic health records (EHRs) and submit quality data as a condition of receiving the incentive payments beginning in 2011. On July 13, 2010, CMS issued two final rules related to the adoption and dissemination of EHRs. One of the rules defines the meaningful use requirements that hospitals and other providers must meet to qualify for federal incentive payments for adopting EHRs under ARRA. The meaningful use final rule includes the following provisions: A requirement that hospitals meet 14 core objectives and select five objectives from a menu of 10 optional objectives for demonstrating that they are meaningful users of EHRs; the remaining five optional objectives may be deferred until year two (CMS original proposal required hospitals to meet 23 objectives); A requirement that hospitals meet 15 clinical quality measures, instead of 35 as originally proposed; A postponement of the administrative simplification objectives for electronic claims submission and eligibility checks; and A limitation on the ability of states to tailor the federal meaningful use definition only as it pertains specifically to public health objectives and data registries. The other final rule released on July 13, 2010 describes the technical capabilities required for certified EHR technology. Hospitals and other providers must adopt certified EHR technology, as well as demonstrate meaningful use to qualify for the federal incentive payments. If we are able to achieve full compliance at all of our hospitals by 2013, we could receive approximately $345 million in total estimated combined Medicare and Medicaid hospital incentive payments. However, based on the timeframe we anticipate it will take for us to achieve full compliance with the HIT requirements, it is unlikely that we will be able to realize the maximum amount of incentive payments of $345 million. We will be required to make investments in HIT through 2014 of approximately $620 million ($144 million of which has already been invested) compared to approximately $320 million of Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments that we will likely be able to begin recognizing no later than 2012 based on our anticipated 44 Table of Contents HIT implementation timeframe. The Medicare incentive payments to individual hospitals would be made over a four year, front weighted transition period. The Medicaid incentive payments, although 100% federally funded, will be administered by the states and are subject to more flexible payment and compliance standards. Hospitals that achieve compliance between 2014 and 2015 will receive reduced incentive payments during the transition period. We anticipate that, in addition to the expenditures we will incur to qualify for these incentive payments, our operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of these information system investments. Much or all of these expenditures may have been made by us as a part of our clinical systems enhancements, but would not have been incurred in the timeline to comply with the incentive payment requirements of ARRA. However, we anticipate there will be other operational benefits that we can realize as a result of these HIT enhancements that are not included in the above amounts. Hospitals that fail to become meaningful users of EHRs or fail to submit quality data by 2015 will be subject to penalties in the form of a reduction to Medicare payments. This reduction, which will be based on the market basket update, will be phased in over three years and will continue until a hospital achieves compliance. Using an estimated market basket of 2.9% and our annual Medicare inpatient net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, should all of our hospitals fail to become meaningful users of EHRs and fail to submit quality data, the penalties would result in reductions to our annual Medicare traditional inpatient net revenues of approximately $11 million, $21 million and $32 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017 and subsequent years, respectively. We are currently evaluating what changes will be required to our information systems, the cost of those changes, and the time and resources required in order for our hospitals to become meaningful users of HIT. The complexity of the changes required to our hospitals systems and the time required to complete the changes will likely result in some or all of our hospitals not being fully compliant in time to be eligible for the maximum HIT funding permitted under ARRA. Because of the uncertainties regarding the implementation of HIT, including CMS future implementation regulations, the ability of our hospitals to achieve compliance and the associated costs, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the aforementioned estimates. Medicare Payments to Physicians In the final rule updating the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for CY 2010, CMS adopted an update of negative 21.2% that was scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2010. MPFS rates are updated annually based on a formula that includes the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula. The SGR formula has resulted in negative updates since 2002; however, CMS has taken action or Congress has enacted legislation each year to avoid the negative updates. On December 21, 2009, the President signed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 into law. Among other things, that act delayed the scheduled 21.2% Medicare payment reduction for physician services until March 1, 2010. Additional legislation extended the zero percent update to the MPFS through May 31, 2010. Subsequent legislation provided for a 2.2% update to the MPFS effective for dates of service June 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. On December 15, 2010, the President signed the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, which delayed a 24.9% reduction in physician payments that was originally scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2011 and extended the 2.2% update to the MPFS for one year. We cannot predict what future actions, if any, Congress or CMS may take with respect to the MPFS update. FFY 2012 Budget Proposal The President released his FFY 2012 budget proposal on February 14, 2011. The key provisions of the budget proposal affecting Medicare and Medicaid include: Funding to continue payments under the MPFS at current levels and offset the costs for the next two years with specific health savings; The termination of funding for the Childrens Hospital Graduate Medical Education payment program; Provisions relating to the recovery of erroneous payments made to insurers participating in Medicare Advantage; and Reductions to the Medicaid provider tax threshold over a three year period beginning in 2015, which would limit state financing practices that increase federal Medicaid spending. 45 Table of Contents Legislation to approve these proposals must be enacted by Congress for them to become effective. We cannot predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to such legislation or the impact the legislation might have on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows. Medicare and Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Initiatives Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 authorized a permanent program involving the use of third party recovery audit contractors (RACs) to identify Medicare overpayments and underpayments made to providers. RACs are compensated based on the amount of both overpayments and underpayments they identify by reviewing claims submitted to Medicare for correct coding and medical necessity. CMS must approve new issues prior to widespread review by the RACs. We have established protocols to respond to RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we intend to pursue the reversal of adverse determinations where appropriate. In addition to overpayments that are not reversed on appeal, we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials. We expect that the RACs will continue to seek CMS approval to review additional issues. The Affordable Care Act expanded the RAC programs scope by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs by December 31, 2010 to audit payments to Medicaid providers. CMS issued a letter to state Medicaid directors on October 1, 2010 that (1) provided preliminary guidance to states on the implementation of Medicaid RAC programs, (2) created a deadline of December 31, 2010 for states to establish RAC programs, and (3) established a deadline of April 1, 2011 for states to fully implement their RAC programs. On February 1, 2011, CMS issued a notice temporarily suspending the requirement that states implement their RAC programs until the final Medicaid RAC rule is issued. We cannot predict with certainty the impact of the Medicare and Medicaid RAC program on our future results of operations or cash flows. MedPAC 2012 Recommendations The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent Congressional agency established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. The MedPACs statutory mandate is quite broad; in addition to advising Congress on payments to private health plans participating in Medicare Advantage and providers in the Original Medicare Plan, MedPAC is also tasked with analyzing access to care, quality of care and other issues affecting Medicare. On January 13, 2011, the MedPAC commissioners voted on final recommendations for their 2011 Report to Congress. Among other things, MedPACs report recommends that hospital inpatient and outpatient services in 2012 be increased by 1%. The 1% increase assumes a market basket increase of 2.5% and a 1.5% partial phase in of the 3.9% permanent reduction in the hospital base payment that MedPAC believes is necessary to account for higher payments resulting from documentation and coding improvements under MS DRGs. (The current law requires a market basket reduction and productivity adjustment that the MedPAC recommendations do not reflect.) Further, MedPACs report recommends that Congress direct CMS to recover all overpayments due to MS DRG coding improvements. Current law limits such recoveries to those that CMS found in FFYs 2008 and 2009. Medicare Value Based Purchasing Section 3001 of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a value based purchasing (VBP) program for hospital payments beginning in FFY 2013 based on hospital performance in 2012 on measures that are part of the hospital inpatient quality reporting program. The VBP program is intended to be budget neutral, with 1% of IPPS payments allocated to the program in FFY 2013, and increasing over time to 2% in FFY 2017 and beyond. On January 7, 2011, CMS issued a proposed rule for the VBP program, pursuant to which hospital performance on each quality measure would be evaluated based on the higher of an achievement score in the performance period or an improvement score, which is determined by comparing the hospitals score in the performance period with its score during a baseline period of performance. For FFY 2013, CMS proposes a nine month performance period from July 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012, with hospitals being notified of the estimated amount of VBP incentive payments for FFY 2013 approximately 60 days prior to October 1, 2012. 46 Table of Contents Although we believe that our Commitment to Quality initiatives described in this report will position our hospitals to benefit under the VBP program, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of the VBP program on our results of operations or cash flows. PRIVATE INSURANCE Managed Care We currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). HMOs generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician, hospital, pharmacy and ancillary service providers that HMO members must access through an assigned primary care physician. The members care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the HMOs quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner. HMOs typically provide reduced benefits or reimbursement (or none at all) to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care. PPOs generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers. PPO members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit, typically in the form of lower co payments, co insurance or deductibles. As employers and employees have demanded more choice, managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both HMO and PPO plans. The amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $5.0 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Approximately 63% of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 was derived from our top ten managed care payers. National payers generate approximately 45% of our total net managed care revenues. The remainder comes from regional or local payers. At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 57% of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers. Revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers. The payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis. At the end of each month, on an individual hospital basis, we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans. Based on reserves as of December 31, 2010, a 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would impact the estimated reserves by approximately $9 million. Some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include: (1) changes in reimbursement levels for procedures, supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered; (2) changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached; (3) changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing; (4) final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels; (5) secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments; and (6) reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels. Contractual allowance 47 Table of Contents estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms, as well as payment history. Although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill, we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. We do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues. In addition, on a corporate wide basis, we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans. We expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term. However, the managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans, which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend. Although we have had 22 consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing, we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in future years. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care and other payers imposed by the Affordable Care Act will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases. In the year ended December 31, 2010, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately 72% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. Indemnity An indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient, subject to a number of policy conditions and exclusions. Unlike an HMO member, a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers. SELF PAY PATIENTS Self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and who do not have some form of private insurance and, therefore, are responsible for their own medical bills. A significant portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment that is more costly to provide and, therefore, results in higher billings, which are the least collectible of all accounts. We believe that our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors, including increased unemployment rates, reductions in state Medicaid budgets, increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance, and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers. Self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems. At both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, approximately 7% of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients. Further, a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients, as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. We provide revenue cycle management and patient communications services through our Conifer subsidiary, which has performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on the drivers of bad debt for each hospital. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts, as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance, that we deem highly collectible. We are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. Over the longer term, several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge. For example, our Compact with Uninsured Patients (Compact) is designed to offer managed care style discounts to certain uninsured patients, which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges. A significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts. Under the Compact, the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance, which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded. The uninsured patient accounts, net of contractual allowances recorded, are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 (the Dodd Frank Act). Among other things, the Dodd Frank Act establishes a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA) within the Federal Reserve and authorizes the CFPA to promulgate regulations to promote transparency, simplicity, fairness, accountability and equal access in the market for consumer financial products or services, including debt collection services. The legislation gives significant discretion to the CFPA in establishing regulatory requirements and enforcement priorities. At this time, we cannot predict the extent to which the operations of our Conifer subsidiary could be affected by these developments. 48 Table of Contents The estimated costs (based on selected operating expenses, which include salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses) of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $376 million, $365 million and $359 million, respectively. We also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. Most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received, subject to a cap. Except for the per diem amounts, our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care; therefore, we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts. Most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospitals eligibility for Medicaid DSH payments. The estimated costs (based on the selected operating expenses described above) of caring for charity care patients for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $120 million, $118 million and $113 million, respectively. Our method of measuring the estimated costs uses adjusted self pay/charity patient days multiplied by selected operating expenses per adjusted patient day. The adjusted self pay/charity patient days represents actual self pay/charity patient days adjusted to include self pay/charity outpatient services by multiplying actual self pay/charity patient days by the sum of gross self pay/charity inpatient revenues and gross self pay/charity outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross self pay/charity inpatient revenues. The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. However, because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the expected increase in revenues and expected decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals, and numerous other provisions in the law that may affect us. In addition, even after implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we may continue to experience a high level of bad debt expense and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care program. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 8,966 $ 8,808 $ 158 Other operations 239 206 33 Net operating revenues 9,205 9,014 191 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 3,900 3,857 43 Supplies 1,577 1,569 8 Provision for doubtful accounts 740 697 43 Other operating expenses, net 1,938 1,909 29 Depreciation and amortization 394 386 8 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 10 27 (17 ) Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 12 31 (19 ) Operating income $ 634 $ 538 $ 96 49 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals 97.4 % 97.7 % (0.3 )% Other operations 2.6 % 2.3 % 0.3 % Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 42.4 % 42.8 % (0.4 )% Supplies 17.1 % 17.4 % (0.3 )% Provision for doubtful accounts 8.0 % 7.7 % 0.3 % Other operating expenses, net 21.1 % 21.2 % (0.1 )% Depreciation and amortization 4.3 % 4.3 % % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 0.1 % 0.3 % (0.2 )% Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 0.1 % 0.3 % (0.2 )% Operating income 6.9 % 6.0 % 0.9 % Net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues, as well as nonpatient revenues (primarily rental income, management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias, gift shops and parking) and other miscellaneous revenue. Net operating revenues of other operations primarily consist of revenues from (1) physician practices, (2) a long term acute care hospital, (3) revenue cycle services provided by our Conifer subsidiary and (4) a rehabilitation hospital, which we closed during the three months ended March 31, 2009. None of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, and only one of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% (approximately 5.4%) our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2010. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $239 million and $206 million in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in net operating revenues from other operations during 2010 primarily relates to our additional owned physician practices and revenue cycle services provided by our Conifer subsidiary. Equity earnings for unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $5 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 50 Table of Contents The tables below show certain selected historical operating statistics of our continuing hospitals: Years Ended December 31, Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) Total admissions 512,972 525,532 (2.4 )% Paying admissions (excludes charity and uninsured) 478,739 491,244 (2.5 )% Charity and uninsured admissions 34,233 34,288 (0.2 )% Admissions through emergency department 300,652 301,593 (0.3 )% Paying admissions as a percentage of total admissions 93.3 % 93.5 % (0.2 )%(1) Charity and uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions 6.7 % 6.5 % 0.2 %(1) Emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions 58.6 % 57.4 % 1.2 %(1) Surgeries inpatient 150,562 154,670 (2.7 )% Surgeries outpatient 209,644 210,043 (0.2 )% Total surgeries 360,206 364,713 (1.2 )% Patient days total 2,473,017 2,553,215 (3.1 )% Adjusted patient days(2) 3,723,702 3,785,230 (1.6 )% Average length of stay (days) 4.8 4.9 (0.1 )(1) Adjusted patient admissions(2) 778,505 784,502 (0.8 )% Number of general hospitals (at end of period) 49 49 (1) Licensed beds (at end of period) 13,428 13,436 (0.1 )% Average licensed beds 13,430 13,419 0.1 % Utilization of licensed beds(3) 50.4 % 52.1 % (1.7 )%(1) (1) The change is the difference between the 2010 and 2009 amounts shown.

REVENUES During the year ended December 31, 2010, net operating revenues from continuing operations increased 2.1%, which included a 1.8% increase in net patient revenues, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Increases in pricing, including the provision of higher acuity services and a favorable shift in managed care payer mix, were the largest contributing factors, resulting in a 3.6% increase in net patient revenues, while declines in our inpatient admissions and outpatient visits resulted in a 1.8% decrease in net patient revenues. Our net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 0.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. There were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues. Key positive factors include: Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts; and The provision of higher acuity services, including a 2.5% increase in acuity for commercial managed care inpatients. 52 Table of Contents Key negative factors include: An unfavorable shift in our total payer mix, including a decline in commercial managed care admissions; An $11 million unfavorable patient revenue adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the portion of our bad debts that will not be reimbursed by Medicare; and An unfavorable patient revenue adjustment of approximately $20 million ($14 million related to prior years and $6 million related to the year ended December 31, 2010) recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2010 for the estimated impact on our DSH payments as a result of estimated lower SSI percentages at certain of our hospitals compared to $23 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Patient days and total admissions decreased during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 by 3.1% and 2.4%, respectively. Our patient volumes in the year ended December 31, 2010 were partially adversely impacted by a decline in flu related volumes, as well as weather related disruptions. We believe the following factors also contributed to the overall decline in our inpatient volume levels: (1) loss of patients to competing health care providers; (2) strategic reduction of services related to our Targeted Growth Initiative, which seeks to de emphasize or eliminate less profitable service lines; and (3) the current weak economic conditions, which we believe have adversely impacted the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals. Net outpatient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 4.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, despite a 0.4% decline in total outpatient visits. The primary reasons for the increase in outpatient revenues are improved terms of our managed care contracts and the provision of higher acuity services. Outpatient revenues were also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of various outpatient centers during 2010. The growth in outpatient revenue per visit of 5.3% was constrained by an unfavorable shift in our total outpatient payer mix, including a decline in managed care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately 2.7% in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. This increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage, increased health benefits costs, an increase in the number of employed physicians, increased severance costs and higher state unemployment taxes, partially offset by decreased accruals for annual incentive compensation, reduced contract labor expense and discretionary contribution expense of $16 million in the 2009 period for contributions to the 401(k) plan accounts of employees who were not eligible for annual incentive compensation. Contract labor expense, which is included in salaries, wages and benefits, was $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $12 million, or 15%, as compared to the same period in 2009. Salaries, wages and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $22 million and $23 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. At December 31, 2010, approximately 20% of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities were represented by various labor unions. To date, labor unions represent registered nurses, service and maintenance workers, and other employees at 15 of our general hospitals, the majority of which are in California. We are in the process of renegotiating the collective bargaining agreements for nearly all of these facilities. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations, but increases in salaries, wages and benefits could result from renegotiated agreements. Furthermore, there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the renegotiation process, which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues. In addition, under the current terms of our peace accords with two labor unions, up to 10 of our general hospitals may be subject to union organizing activities in 2011. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009; supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by 2.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Supplies expense was unfavorably impacted by the increased utilization of high cost implants and pharmaceuticals, partially offset by decreases in the cost of pacemakers due to renegotiated prices and lower volume levels. A portion of the increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers. 53 Table of Contents We strive to control supplies expense through product standardization, bulk purchases, contract compliance, improved utilization and operational improvements that should minimize waste. The items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers, orthopedics and implants, and high cost pharmaceuticals. We also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of Broadlane, Inc., a company that offers group purchasing procurement strategy, outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry. PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues was 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts is primarily due to a 180 basis point decline in our collection rate on self pay accounts, a $19 million increase in uninsured revenues and higher pricing. These items were partially offset by $37 million of favorable adjustments for Medicare bad debts that we will claim on our Medicare cost reports and improved managed care accounts receivable balances by aging category. Our self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 28.3% as of December 31, 2010 from 30.1% as of December 31, 2009. The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at December 31, 2010 and 2009: December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Allowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Net AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Allowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Net Medicare $ 159 $ $ 159 $ 162 $ $ 162 Medicaid 118 118 106 106 Net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (26 ) (26 ) (24 ) (24 ) Managed care 714 60 654 712 62 650 Self pay uninsured 194 172 22 204 175 29 Self pay balance after insurance 119 66 53 118 62 56 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to our collection agency subsidiary 33 33 35 35 Other payers 168 39 129 164 42 122 Total continuing operations 1,479 337 1,142 1,477 341 1,136 Total discontinued operations 16 15 1 50 28 22 $ 1,495 $ 352 $ 1,143 $ 1,527 $ 369 $ 1,158 A significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients, as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. Collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus, particularly over the past several years, as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix. At December 31, 2010, our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 28.3%, including collections from point of service through collections by our collection agency subsidiary. During 2009 and 2010, we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows: 31.4% at March 31, 2009; 30.8% at June 30, 2009; 30.3% at September 30, 2009; 30.1% at December 31, 2009; 29.9% at March 31, 2010; 29.5% at June 30, 2010; and 29.1% at September 30, 2010. These self pay collection rates include payments made by patients, including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance, prior to an account being classified and assigned to our collection agency subsidiary. Based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 10% decline in our self pay collection rate, or approximately 3%, would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $5 million. We provide revenue cycle management and patient communications services through our Conifer subsidiary, which has performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on the drivers of bad debt for each hospital. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts, as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance, that we deem highly collectible. We are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. 54 Table of Contents Payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts. We typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes; however, we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services. Our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately 98.4% at December 31, 2010 and 98.0% at December 31, 2009, which includes collections from point of service through collections by our collection agency subsidiary. We continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow. One specific initiative is our Center for Patient Access Services (CPAS), which is a centralized, dedicated operation that performs financial clearance, including completing insurance eligibility checks, documenting verification of benefits, providing required notifications to managed care payers, obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling. Although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable. We manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as (1) total cash collections, (2) point of service cash collections, (3) accounts receivable days outstanding (AR Days), and (4) accounts receivable by aging category. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from continuing operations of $1.168 billion and $1.160 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $26 million and $24 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively: December 31, 2010 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 96 % 70 % 79 % 27 % 71 % 61 120 days 3 % 22 % 12 % 29 % 15 % 121 180 days 1 % 8 % 4 % 13 % 6 % Over 180 days % % 5 % 31 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % December 31, 2009 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 94 % 63 % 78 % 26 % 69 % 61 120 days 3 % 24 % 12 % 27 % 15 % 121 180 days 3 % 11 % 5 % 13 % 6 % Over 180 days % 2 % 5 % 34 % 10 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 46 days at both December 31, 2010 and 2009, within our target of less than 50 days. AR Days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenues from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter. As of December 31, 2010, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $4.3 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our collection agency subsidiary. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts assigned to our collection agency subsidiary is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. Patient advocates from our Medical Eligibility Program (MEP) screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs. They also expedite the process of applying for these government programs. Receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for Medicaid are classified as Medicaid pending, under our MEP, with appropriate contractual allowances recorded. Based on recent trends, approximately 85% of all accounts in our MEP are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as Medicaid. 55 Table of Contents The following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our MEP, still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2010 and 2009, by aging category: December 31, 2010 2009 0 60 days $ 100 $ 66 61 120 days 21 18 121 180 days 8 5 Over 180 days(1) Total $ 129 $ 89 (1) Includes accounts receivable of $13 million and $10 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, that are fully reserved. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, NET Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues was 21.1% in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 21.2% in the year ended December 31, 2009. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by approximately 3.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. This increase is primarily due to the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage, increases in the costs of repairs, maintenance and technology service contracts ($17 million), a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations ($15 million), increased costs of contracted services ($11 million), increased physician relocation costs ($10 million), increased systems implementation costs ($3 million), and increased hospital provider fees assessed by the states in which we operate ($17 million), which were substantially offset by additional Medicaid supplemental payments recognized in revenues. Also partially offsetting these increases was a $32 million, or 36%, decline in malpractice expense to $57 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $89 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The decline in malpractice expense is principally due to a 6% decrease in the average cost per claim and a 3% decrease in the number of expected claims. There was minimal impact to expense from a two basis point increase in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities, compared to $9 million of similar expense in the year ended December 31, 2009. The amount of malpractice expense in the year ended December 31, 2010 may not necessarily be indicative of malpractice expense amounts in future years due to changes in loss experience and interest rates used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities. Declines in rent expense ($7 million) and a favorable adjustment of $10 million relating to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents, which was recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2010, also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $10 million. We recorded a $5 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital, consistent with our prior estimates during 2009 and 2008 when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. Unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets, this hospital is at risk of future impairments, particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate or equipment continues to decline. The aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was $25 million as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we recorded a $5 million net impairment charge in connection with the sale of nine medical office buildings in Florida and $2 million in employee severance and other related costs. These charges were partially offset by a $2 million credit related to the collection of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals, which had been fully reserved in a prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $27 million. We recorded a $7 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates. Material adverse 56 Table of Contents trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time, consistent with our prior estimates during 2008 when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believed the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. We also recorded a $10 million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the campus of one hospital that was scheduled to move to a new, replacement campus during 2010. Our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the former campus for several months during 2010 and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings of the campus. We compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and, because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 include $4 million of employee severance and other related costs, a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals as a result of the buyer filing for bankruptcy, and a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of other assets primarily related to an option to purchase certain real property near one of our hospitals that no longer had value due to the financial condition of the owner of the real property. Our impairment tests presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results in our hospitals, which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospitals most recent projections. If these projections are not met, or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we may incur additional restructuring charges. Future restructuring of our regions or markets that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in future impairments of our goodwill. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $12 million compared to $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2010 costs primarily relate to costs to defend the Company in various matters and changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in Note 15 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as costs associated with the unsolicited acquisition proposal we received in November 2010. The 2009 costs primarily relate to reserves established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in Note 15 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2009 costs also include amounts paid to indemnify a former officer of the Company in a matter to which the Company was not a party and costs to defend the Company in various matters. INTEREST EXPENSE During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded interest expense of $424 million compared to $445 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in interest expense primarily relates to our repurchases of outstanding senior notes during 2009 and 2010. GAIN (LOSS) FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $57 million, primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the $782 million aggregate principal amount of 73/8% senior notes due 2013 that we repurchased during the period, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes. In addition, we repurchased $40 million aggregate principal amount of our 97/8% senior notes due 2014 and $7 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for total cash of $49 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $97 million, primarily related to the estimated fair values of new notes issued in note exchanges at less than their par values, net of the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes tendered, as well as other notes repurchased. See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details about our debt transactions. 57 Table of Contents INVESTMENT EARNINGS During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded investment earnings of $5 million compared to no investment earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009. In 2009, investment earnings were offset by a $7 million loss related to an agreement reached during June 2009 for the early redemption of our $56 million investment in hospital authority bonds related to previously divested hospitals in the Dallas, Texas area for $49 million of cash that we received in June 2009. NET GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain on sale of investments of approximately $15 million in continuing operations related to the sale of our 50% membership interest in Peoples Health Network, the company that administered the operations of Tenet Choices, Inc., our wholly owned Medicare Advantage HMO insurance subsidiary in Louisiana. INCOME TAX BENEFIT During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an income tax benefit of $977 million compared to $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The benefit recorded in the 2010 period is primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets. The net decrease in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to the estimated realization of deferred tax assets resulting from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against projected future years taxable income. During the year ended December 31, 2010, after considering all available evidence, both positive and negative, we concluded that the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets could be reduced by approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about the 2010 tax benefit. ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL NON GAAP DISCLOSURES The financial information provided throughout this report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, we use certain non GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements, some of which are recurring or involve cash payments. In addition, from time to time we use these measures to define certain performance targets under our compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA is a non GAAP measure that we use in our analysis of the performance of our business, which we define as net income (loss) attributable to our common shareholders before: (1) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax; (2) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (3) preferred stock dividends; (4) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (5) income tax benefit (expense); (6) investment earnings (loss); (7) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt; (8) net gain (loss) on sales of investments; (9) interest expense; (10) litigation and investigation benefit (costs), net of insurance recoveries; (11) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs; (12) impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries; and (13) depreciation and amortization. As is the case with all non GAAP measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with this metric, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another, and should recognize that Adjusted EBITDA does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance because it excludes many items that are included in our financial statements. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance. 58 Table of Contents The table below shows the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to our common shareholders (the most comparable GAAP term) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Net income attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders $ 1,119 $ 181 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (9 ) (10 ) Preferred stock dividends (24 ) (6 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 17 (31 ) Income from continuing operations 1,135 228 Income tax benefit 977 23 Investment earnings 5 Gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt (57 ) 97 Net gain on sales of investments 15 Interest expense (424 ) (445 ) Operating income 634 538 Litigation and investigation costs (12 ) (31 ) Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges (10 ) (27 ) Depreciation and amortization (394 ) (386 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,050 $ 982 Net operating revenues $ 9,205 $ 9,014 Adjusted EBITDA as % of net operating revenues (Adjusted EBITDA margin) 11.4 % 10.9 % Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non GAAP term that we define as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less payments against reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs, operating cash flows from discontinued operations, capital expenditures in continuing operations, and new and replacement hospital construction expenditures. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a measure of liquidity that we use in our business as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. We provide this financial measure as a supplement to GAAP information to assist ourselves and investors in understanding the impact of various items on our cash flows, some of which are recurring. Because Adjusted Free Cash Flow excludes many items that are included in our financial statements, it does not provide a complete measure of our liquidity. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our liquidity. The following table shows the reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP term) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 472 $ 425 Less: Payments against reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs (83 ) (192 ) Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations 40 Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations 555 577 Purchases of property and equipment continuing operations (450 ) (397 ) Construction of new and replacement hospitals (13 ) (58 ) Adjusted Free Cash Flow continuing operations $ 92 $ 122 59 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 8,808 $ 8,412 $ 396 Other operations 206 173 33 Net operating revenues 9,014 8,585 429 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 3,857 3,779 78 Supplies 1,569 1,511 58 Provision for doubtful accounts 697 628 69 Other operating expenses, net 1,909 1,928 (19 ) Depreciation and amortization 386 371 15 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 27 16 11 Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 31 41 (10 ) Operating income $ 538 $ 311 $ 227 Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals 97.7 % 98.0 % (0.3 )% Other operations 2.3 % 2.0 % 0.3 % Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 42.8 % 44.0 % (1.2 )% Supplies 17.4 % 17.6 % (0.2 )% Provision for doubtful accounts 7.7 % 7.3 % 0.4 % Other operating expenses, net 21.2 % 22.5 % (1.3 )% Depreciation and amortization 4.3 % 4.3 % % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.1 % Litigation and investigation costs, net of insurance recoveries 0.3 % 0.5 % (0.2 )% Operating income 6.0 % 3.6 % 2.4 % Revenues from our general hospitals represented over 97% of our total net operating revenues in both 2009 and 2008. Only one of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% (approximately 5.1%) of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, and one represented more than 5% (approximately 5.5%) of our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2009. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $206 million and $173 million in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in net operating revenues from other operations during 2009 primarily relates to our additional owned physician practices. Equity earnings for unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $6 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 60 Table of Contents The tables below show certain selected historical operating statistics of our continuing hospitals on a same hospital basis. We have excluded two of our hospitals from the same hospital statistics for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The hospitals excluded are Sierra Providence East Medical Center, which opened in May 2008, and NorthShore Regional Medical Center, which was reclassified to discontinued operations during the three months ended June 30, 2009.

REVENUES During the year ended December 31, 2009, net operating revenues from continuing operations increased 5.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Our same hospital net patient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 4.1% compared to the same period in 2008. Increases in pricing, including the provision of higher acuity services and a favorable shift in managed care payer mix, were the largest contributing factors, resulting in a 3.5% increase in net patient revenues, while a decline in our inpatient admissions and an increase in outpatient visits resulted in a 0.6% increase in net patient revenues. Our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 2.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. There were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues. Key positive factors include: Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts; 62 Table of Contents Favorable adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances of $15 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3 million in the same period in 2008; and DSH payments and other state funded subsidy payments of $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $153 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. Key negative factors include: An unfavorable shift in our total payer mix, including a decline in commercial managed care admissions. Same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 6.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The primary reasons for this increase are improved managed care pricing and increased volume levels. Total same hospital outpatient visits and outpatient surgery visits for 2009 increased by 3.4% and 3.5%, respectively, compared to 2008. SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Same hospital salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased by approximately 1.3% in 2009 as compared to 2008. This increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, an increase in the number of employed physicians and higher incentive compensation and health benefits costs, partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount, reduced contract labor expense, lower stock based compensation expense, and lower overtime costs. Contract labor expense, which is included in salaries, wages and benefits, was $81 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $63 million, or 43.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 17.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008; supplies expense per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis increased by 2.7% in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in supplies expense is primarily due to the increase in the number of surgeries, which grew by 1.6%, and increased utilization of high cost implants and pharmaceuticals, as well as increased orthopedic costs. A portion of the increase in supplies expense was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers. PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues on a same hospital basis was 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts was related to decreased collection rates on self pay accounts, higher pricing and higher patient insurance deductibles, partially offset by a decline in uninsured revenues and improved managed care accounts receivable aging categories. Our self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 30.1% as of December 31, 2009 from 32.5% as of December 31, 2008. 63 Table of Contents The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008: December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Allowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Net AccountsReceivableBeforeAllowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Allowancefor DoubtfulAccounts Net Medicare $ 162 $ $ 162 $ 156 $ $ 156 Medicaid 106 106 121 121 Net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (24 ) (24 ) (20 ) (20 ) Managed care 712 62 650 724 71 653 Self pay uninsured 204 175 29 190 161 29 Self pay balance after insurance 118 62 56 139 71 68 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to our collection agency subsidiary 35 35 40 40 Other payers 164 42 122 176 40 136 Total continuing operations 1,477 341 1,136 1,526 343 1,183 Total discontinued operations 50 28 22 207 53 154 $ 1,527 $ 369 $ 1,158 $ 1,733 $ 396 $ 1,337 At December 31, 2009, our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 30.1%, including collections from point of service through collections by our collection agency subsidiary. During 2008 and 2009, we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows: 35.0% at March 31, 2008; 34.0% at June 30, 2008; 33.3% at September 30, 2008; 32.5% at December 31, 2008; 31.4% at March 31, 2009; 30.8% at June 30, 2009; and 30.3% at September 30, 2009. These self pay collection rates include payments made by patients, including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance, prior to an account being classified and assigned to our collection agency subsidiary. Our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately 98.0% at December 31, 2009 and 97.8% at December 31, 2008, which includes collections from point of service through collections by our collection agency subsidiary. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from continuing operations of $1.160 billion and $1.203 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $24 million and $20 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively: December 31, 2009 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 94 % 63 % 78 % 26 % 69 % 61 120 days 3 % 24 % 12 % 27 % 15 % 121 180 days 3 % 11 % 5 % 13 % 6 % Over 180 days % 2 % 5 % 34 % 10 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % December 31, 2008 Medicare Medicaid ManagedCare Indemnity,Self Payand Other Total 0 60 days 99 % 64 % 77 % 33 % 69 % 61 120 days 1 % 24 % 14 % 24 % 15 % 121 180 days % 12 % 5 % 11 % 7 % Over 180 days % % 4 % 32 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 46 days at December 31, 2009 and 50 days at December 31, 2008. AR Days at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were within our targets at those times of less than 50 and 55 days, respectively. AR Days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter. 64 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $4.3 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our collection agency subsidiary. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts assigned to our collection agency subsidiary is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. The following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our MEP still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2009 and 2008 by aging category: December 31, 2009 2008 0 60 days $ 66 $ 87 61 120 days 18 25 121 180 days 5 6 Over 180 days(1) Total $ 89 $ 118 (1) Includes accounts receivable of $10 million at both December 31, 2009 and 2008 that are fully reserved. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, NET Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased by 1.3% in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis decreased by approximately 1.6% in 2009 as compared to 2008. Contributing to this decrease was a $37 million, or 29.4%, decline in total hospital malpractice expense to $89 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $126 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in malpractice expense is principally due to a 6% reduction in the number of expected claims, partially offset by an increase of $9 million from a 63 basis point decline in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future liabilities. Declines in consulting costs ($10 million), utility costs ($8 million), reimbursable business expenses ($7 million), systems implementation costs ($5 million) and recruiting related costs ($3 million) also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses. These declines were partially offset by increases in other items, including a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations ($21 million), higher costs for contracted services ($10 million), and higher physician fees relating to increased emergency department on call payments ($3 million). IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $27 million. We recorded a $7 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates. Material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time, consistent with our prior estimates during 2008 when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believed the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. We also recorded a $10 million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the campus of one hospital that was scheduled to move to a new, replacement campus during 2010. Our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the former campus for several months during 2010 and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings of the campus. We compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and, because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 include $4 million of employee severance and other related costs, a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals as a result of the buyer filing for bankruptcy, and a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of other assets primarily related to an option to purchase certain real property near one of our hospitals that no longer had value due to the financial condition of the owner of the real property. 65 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008, net impairment and restructuring charges of $16 million included an $8 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of two hospitals to their estimated fair values due to adverse current and anticipated future financial trends based on their most recent projections at that time. We believed the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends included shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers and high levels of uninsured patients. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 include $6 million of employee severance and other related costs, $1 million for the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and $6 million in impairment charges for the write down of other assets primarily due to the write down of costs associated with an expansion project at one of our hospitals that we decided not to pursue based on unfavorable economics forecasted for the project, partially offset by a $5 million reduction in reserves recorded in prior periods. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS, NET OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $31 million compared to $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The 2009 costs primarily relate to reserves established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in Note 15 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2009 costs also include amounts paid to indemnify a former officer of the Company in a matter to which the Company was not a party and costs to defend the Company in various matters. The 2008 costs primarily relate to changes in our estimated liability for wage and hour actions that were settled in May 2009 and paid during the three months ended September 30, 2009. The 2008 costs were partially offset by $6 million of insurance proceeds that were recorded as a recovery of litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for costs we previously incurred related to our December 2004 Redding Medical Center litigation settlement. INTEREST EXPENSE During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded interest expense of $445 million compared to $418 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in interest expense primarily relates to higher interest rates on senior secured notes we issued in 2009, partially offset by the impact of interest rate swap and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) interest rate cap agreements. GAIN (LOSS) FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $97 million, primarily related to the estimated fair values of new notes issued in note exchanges at less than their par values, net of the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes tendered, as well as other notes repurchased. See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details about our debt transactions. INVESTMENT EARNINGS During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded no net investment earnings compared to investment earnings of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In 2009, investment earnings were offset a $7 million loss related to an agreement reached during June 2009 for the early redemption of our $56 million investment in hospital authority bonds related to previously divested hospitals in the Dallas, Texas area for $49 million of cash that we received in June 2009. In the year ended December 31, 2008, $10 million was recorded in investment earnings related to insurance proceeds we received in 2008 in connection with our 2004 Redding Medical Center litigation settlement. NET GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain on sale of investments of approximately $15 million related to the sale of our 50% membership interest in Peoples Health Network. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded net gains of $125 million from the sale of our entire interest in Broadlane, Inc. and $14 million on the sale of our interest in a joint venture with a real estate investment trust. 66 Table of Contents INCOME TAX BENEFIT During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $23 million compared to $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about income taxes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH REQUIREMENTS Our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees, are summarized in the table below, all as of December 31, 2010: Years Ending December 31, LaterYears Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 (In Millions) Long term debt(1) $ 6,629 $ 434 $ 422 $ 570 $ 405 $ 1,473 $ 3,325 Capital lease obligations(1) 2 2 Long term non cancelable operating leases 381 98 85 74 37 23 64 Standby letters of credit 181 179 2 Guarantees(2) 98 69 18 5 1 5 Asset retirement obligations 153 153 Academic affiliation agreements(3) 280 41 39 39 19 19 123 Tax liabilities 108 40 68 Supplemental executive retirement plan obligations 543 19 20 19 19 20 446 Information technology contract services 746 138 141 133 108 111 115 Purchase orders 255 255 Total(4) $ 9,376 $ 1,273 $ 725 $ 842 $ 589 $ 1,651 $ 4,296 (1) Includes interest through maturity date/lease termination. (2) Includes minimum revenue guarantees, primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals, and operating lease guarantees. (3) These agreements contain various rights and termination provisions. (4) Professional liability and workers compensation reserves have been excluded from the table. At December 31, 2010, the current and long term professional and general liability reserves included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were approximately $84 million and $383 million, respectively, and the current and long term workers compensation reserves included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were approximately $44 million and $123 million, respectively. Standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs. The amount of collateral required is primarily dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness. The insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers. The standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility. We consummated the following transactions affecting our long term debt in the year ended December 31, 2010: In August 2010, we repurchased approximately $782 million aggregate principal amount of our 73/8% senior notes due 2013 for approximately $829 million. We repurchased the senior notes with the net proceeds of approximately $585 million from our sale of new 8% senior notes due 2020 and cash on hand. Also in August 2010, we repurchased $6 million aggregate principal amount of our 97/8% senior notes due 2014 for total cash of approximately $6 million. In July 2010, we repurchased $34 million aggregate principal amount of our 97/8% senior notes due 2014 and approximately $7 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for total cash of approximately $43 million. In June 2010, we repurchased $2 million aggregate principal amount of our 73/8% senior notes due 2013 and $2 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for total cash of approximately $4 million. In March 2010, we repurchased $6 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for cash of approximately $6 million. 67 Table of Contents As part of our long term objective to manage our capital structure, we may from time to time seek to retire, purchase, redeem or refinance some of our outstanding debt or equity securities subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. These actions are part of our strategy to manage our leverage and capital structure over time, which is dependent on our total amount of debt, our cash and our operating results. At December 31, 2010, using the last 12 months of Adjusted EBITDA, our ratio of total long term debt, net of cash and cash equivalent balances, to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.5x. We anticipate this ratio will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on earnings performance and other factors. We intend to manage this ratio by following our business plan, managing our cost structure and through other changes in our capital structure, including, if appropriate, the issuance of equity or convertible securities. Our ability to achieve our leverage and capital structure objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities (including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations), equipment and information systems additions and replacements (including those required to achieve compliance with the health information technology requirements under ARRA), introduction of new medical technologies, design and construction of new buildings, and various other capital improvements. Capital expenditures were $476 million, $456 million and $547 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which include $13 million, $1 million and $20 million, respectively, related to discontinued operations. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the year ending December 31, 2011 will total approximately $475 million to $525 million, including $91 million that was accrued as a liability at December 31, 2010. Our anticipated 2011 capital expenditures include approximately $1 million to meet seismic requirements for our California facilities. We currently estimate spending a total of approximately $31 million (of which approximately $27 million was spent prior to January 1, 2011) to comply with the requirements under Californias seismic regulations compared to our estimate as of December 31, 2009 of approximately $80 million. Our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than previous estimates because a number of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using a new seismic evaluation tool. There may be further reductions to our estimated seismic costs as the State of California completes its review of our other hospitals. Our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for future inflation. Our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2011 also include approximately $17 million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit. We expect to spend approximately $98 million more on such improvements over the next five years. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired various outpatient centers in California, Florida, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $65 million, which we funded with cash on hand. These acquisitions were made in furtherance of our efforts to expand our outpatient services and increase our outpatient revenues. Interest payments, net of capitalized interest, were $402 million, $439 million and $391 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest payments were higher in the 2009 period as compared to the 2010 and 2008 periods primarily due to $23 million of interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of our exchange of approximately $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 63/8% senior notes due 2011 and our 61/2% senior notes due 2012 for new senior secured notes, as well as other subsequent debt repurchases that reduced our outstanding debt. In the year ended December 31, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion. The interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates. It had the effect of converting our 73/ 8% senior notes due 2013 from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid monthly based on the one month LIBOR plus a floating rate spread of approximately 5.46%. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the 73/8% senior notes, which substantially offset each other, were recorded in interest expense. To mitigate risks related to potential significant increases in the one month LIBOR, we also entered into a separate agreement that limited the maximum one month LIBOR to 8% under the interest rate swap agreement. We realized approximately $8 million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement, which we entered into in May 2009 and terminated in November 2009. Depending on then existing market conditions, we may elect to enter into similar interest rate swap agreements in the future. Income tax refunds, net of tax payments, were approximately $34 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to income tax payments, net of tax refunds, of approximately $43 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of (1) federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $2.2 billion pretax expiring in 2024 to 2030, (2) approximately $24 million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration, (3) general business credit carryforwards of approximately $14 million 68 Table of Contents expiring in 2023 to 2030 and (4) state NOL carryforwards of $3.5 billion expiring in 2011 to 2030 for which the associated deferred tax benefit, net of valuation allowance and federal tax impact, is $35 million. Our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period. These ownership changes include the offering of stock by us, the purchase or sale of our stock by 5% shareholders, as defined in the Treasury regulations, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock. If such ownership changes by 5% shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed 50 percentage points during the three year period, then Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards at the time of ownership change. In January 2011, our board of directors adopted a Section 382 rights agreement as a measure intended to deter such ownership changes in order to preserve our NOL carryforwards (see Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Periodic examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing authorities could result in the payment of additional taxes. The audit of our tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007 has been completed by the IRS. These returns include deductions for amounts paid in connection with our 2006 civil settlement with the federal government and upon which taxes had been paid by us in previous taxable years. We filed tax refund claims to recover such previously paid taxes, and we received tax refunds of approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2009. Upon completion of the audit, we reached a settlement with the IRS, which was approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, in which we agreed to repay approximately $12 million of the refunds previously received plus approximately $3 million of interest. SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily derived from cash on hand. We had approximately $405 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2010 to fund our operations and capital expenditures. Our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable. As we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients increase, our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $472 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $425 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the 2010 and 2009 periods include the following: Increased income from continuing operations before income taxes of $68 million, excluding net gain on sales of investments, investment earnings (loss), gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, interest expense, litigation and investigation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, and depreciation and amortization in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009; Lower interest payments of $37 million, primarily due to $23 million of interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of our exchange of approximately $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 63/8% senior notes due 2011 and our 61/2% senior notes due 2012 for new senior secured notes and other subsequent debt repurchases with the proceeds from our issuance of preferred stock and cash on hand that reduced our outstanding debt, as well as payments made as a result of our then existing interest rate swap agreement, which we terminated in November 2009; Lower aggregate annual 401(k) matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of $18 million ($105 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $123 million in the year ended December 31, 2009); Net income tax refunds of $34 million received in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to net income tax payments of $43 million in the year ended December 31, 2009; Lower payments on reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs of $109 million, primarily due to $81 million of payments in the year ended December 31, 2009 related to our settlement of wage and hour actions; $40 million less cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations, principally due to accounts receivable collections in the prior year related to divested hospitals; Reduced cash flows of $175 million primarily due to the payment of additional accounts payable at December 31, 2009, other changes in working capital and changes in long term liabilities, including the following: a $105 million reduction in our professional and general liability reserves primarily due to improved claims experience and claim payments; 69 Table of Contents a $27 million receivable recorded in 2010 for Medicare bad debts that we have claimed or will claim on our Medicare cost reports, a substantial portion of which is expected to be collected in 2011; and a $10 million receivable recorded in 2010 that we expect to collect in 2011 relating to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid by us prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents; and $39 million we received in the year ended December 31, 2009 under our then existing interest rate swap agreement, which we terminated in November 2009. Proceeds from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2009 aggregated $221 million, primarily from the sale of USC University Hospital and USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital. We continue to seek further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet by generating incremental cash. These initiatives include the sale of excess land, buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets. In October 2010, we sold nine medical office buildings in Florida for aggregate cash proceeds of $46 million. Capital expenditures were $476 million and $456 million in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, including approximately $13 million and $58 million in the same respective periods for construction of a replacement hospital for our East Cooper Regional Medical Center in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. We use fair market value to record our investments that are available for sale. As shown in Note 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs. We have no investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the current economic downturn that will materially impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND RELATED COVENANTS In October 2010, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that, among other things, extended the term of our existing senior secured revolving credit facility (Amended Credit Agreement). The Amended Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on October 19, 2015; however, this date could be accelerated to as early as the fourth quarter of 2014 if 80% of our notes due in 2015 are not repaid, defeased or refinanced 60 business days prior to their maturity. The Amended Credit Agreement provides, subject to borrowing availability, for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $800 million, with a $300 million subfacility for standby letters of credit. We are in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our Amended Credit Agreement. For additional information regarding the Amended Credit Agreement, see Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Our borrowing availability under the Amended Credit Agreement was $507 million based on our borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2010. There were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2010, and we had approximately $181 million of standby letters of credit outstanding. In August 2010, we sold $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8% senior notes due 2020. The notes will mature on August 1, 2020. We will pay interest on the 8% senior notes semi annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, which payments commenced on February 1, 2011. The notes are general unsecured senior debt obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness, but are effectively subordinated to our senior secured notes, the obligations of our subsidiaries and any obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement to the extent of the collateral. Also in August 2010, we repurchased approximately $782 million aggregate principal amount of our 73/8% senior notes due 2013 and $6 million aggregate principal amount of our 97/8% senior notes due 2014 for approximately $835 million, including approximately $4 million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase. We repurchased the senior notes with the net proceeds of approximately $585 million from our sale of new 8% senior notes due 2020 and cash on hand. In connection with these purchases, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $52 million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes. In July 2010, we repurchased $34 million aggregate principal amount of our 97/ 8% senior notes due 2014 and approximately $7 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for total cash of approximately $43 million, including less than $1 million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase. In connection with these purchases, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $3 million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs. 70 Table of Contents For additional information regarding our long term debt, see Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital markets, bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time. We believe our existing debt agreements provide significant flexibility for future secured or unsecured borrowings. Our cash on hand fluctuates day to day throughout the year based on the timing and levels of routine cash receipts and disbursements, including our book overdrafts, and required cash disbursements, such as interest and income tax payments. These fluctuations have resulted in intra quarter net operating and investing cash uses of $80 million to $250 million and could cause us to use our senior secured revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity. During 2011, we could be required to pay the Medicare program approximately $50 million as a result of the SSI matter described under Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments above unless CMS changes its policy regarding the inclusion of Medicare Advantage days in the calculation of the SSI ratio prior to its removal of the moratorium on cost report settlements. We would be required to make the payments at the time of the cost report settlements pending the final outcome of our appeals related to this matter. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand, availability under our revolving credit facility, anticipated future cash provided by operating activities, and our investments in marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet should be adequate to meet our current cash needs. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures, payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs. Long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities and, given favorable market conditions, future borrowings or refinancings. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by the use of cash in acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of securities, and also by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections of this report, which could require us to pursue any number of financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt refinancings, asset sales or other financing alternatives. The level, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured. We do not rely on commercial paper or other short term financing arrangements nor do we enter into repurchase agreements or other short term financing arrangements not otherwise reported in our period end balance sheets. We continue to aggressively identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. Among the areas being addressed are volume growth, managed care payer contracting, procurement efficiencies, cost standardization, bad debt expense reduction initiatives, underperforming hospitals, and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care. Although these initiatives may result in improved performance, that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Excluding the hospitals whose operating results are included in discontinued operations, our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 include $946 million, $923 million and $923 million, respectively, of net operating revenues and $94 million, $99 million and $891 million, respectively, of income from operations generated from four general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements. In accordance with GAAP, the applicable buildings and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases. The current terms of these leases expire between 2014 and 2027, not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise. If these leases expire, we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, except for $279 million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of December 31, 2010. 71 Table of Contents RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use. In general, we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, given the particular circumstances in which we operate. Actual results may vary from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine, and (3) may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas: Recognition of net operating revenues, including contractual allowances; Provisions for doubtful accounts; Accruals for general and professional liability risks; Accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans; Accruals for litigation losses; Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill; Accounting for income taxes; and Accounting for stock based compensation. REVENUE RECOGNITION We recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed. Net operating revenues primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates (i.e., gross charges), less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances, principally for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care and other health plans, as well as certain uninsured patients under the Compact. Revenues under the traditional fee for service Medicare and Medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems. Discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues, which were more prevalent in earlier periods, and certain other payments, such as DSH, DGME, IME and bad debt expense, which are based on our hospitals cost reports, are estimated using historical trends and current factors. Cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by Medicare and Medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review, and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved. Because the laws, regulations, instructions and rule interpretations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently, the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts. We have a system and estimation process for recording Medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements. This results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports. For filed cost reports, we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports, and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. Revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers. The payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis. At the end of each month, on an individual hospital basis, we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans. Based on our reserves as of December 31, 2010, a 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances would impact the estimated reserves by approximately $9 million. Some of the factors that can contribute to changes 72 Table of Contents in the contractual allowance estimates include: (1) changes in reimbursement levels for procedures, supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered; (2) changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached; (3) changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing; (4) final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels; (5) secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments; and (6) reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels. Contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history. Although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill, we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. We do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues. In addition, on a corporate wide basis, we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans. Revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the Compact, whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance. We believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements. We know of no material claims, disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our Consolidated Financial Statements. PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Although outcomes vary, our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients, including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). Generally, as required by EMTALA, patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay. Therefore, services, including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient, are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information. In non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services, it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated; however, there are various exceptions that can occur. Such exceptions can include, for example, instances where (1) we are unable to obtain verification because the patients insurance company was unable to be reached or contacted, (2) a determination is made that a patient may be eligible for benefits under various government programs, such as Medicaid or Victims of Crime, and it takes several days or weeks before qualification for such benefits is confirmed or denied, and (3) under physician orders we provide services to patients that require immediate treatment. We provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital, our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an 18 month look back period, and other relevant factors. Based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance as of December 31, 2010, a hypothetical 10% decline in our self pay collection rate, or approximately 3.0%, would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $5 million. There are various factors that can impact collection trends, such as changes in the economy, which in turn have an impact on unemployment rates and the number of uninsured and underinsured patients, the volume of patients through the emergency department, the increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients with insurance, and business practices related to collection efforts. These factors continuously change and can have an impact on collection trends and our estimation process. Our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable, including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing. Generally, uncollected balances are assigned to our collection agency subsidiary between 90 to 180 days, once patient responsibility has been identified. When accounts are assigned to our collection agency subsidiary by the hospital, the accounts are completely written off the hospitals books through the provision for doubtful accounts, and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospitals books at the same time. The estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates. The estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our collection agency subsidiary. Managed care accounts are collected through our regional business offices, whereby the account balances remain in the related hospitals patient accounting system and on the hospitals books, and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age. Managed care accounts collected through our regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years. 73 Table of Contents Changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts. We continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings. We aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal, including arbitration and litigation, but we may not be successful. ACCRUALS FOR GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY RISKS We accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims, to the extent not covered by insurance, when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We maintain reserves, which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks, including incurred but not reported claims, to the extent we do not have insurance coverage. Our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors, including the number of expected claims, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, the timing of historical payments, and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments. We consider the number of expected claims, average cost per claim and discount rate to be the most significant assumptions in estimating accruals for general and professional liabilities. Our liabilities are adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known. Malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our estimated reserves for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be a 5% increase or decrease in the number of expected claims or average cost per claim. Based on our reserves and other information as of December 31, 2010, a 5% increase in the number of expected claims would increase the estimated reserves by $42 million, and a 5% decrease in the number of expected claims would decrease the estimated reserves by $27 million. A 5% increase in the average cost per claim would increase the estimated reserves by $77 million, and a 5% decrease in the average cost per claim would decrease the estimated reserves by $57 million. Because our estimated reserves for future claim payments are discounted to present value, a change in our discount rate assumption could also have a significant impact on our estimated reserves. Our discount rate was 2.71%, 2.69% and 3.32% at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the estimated reserves by $12 million. In addition, because of the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. The table below shows the case reserves and incurred but not reported and loss development reserves as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Case reserves $ 161 $ 167 $ 185 Incurred but not reported and loss development reserves 356 483 550 Total undiscounted reserves $ 517 $ 650 $ 735 Several actuarial methods, including the incurred, paid loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, are applied to our historical loss data to produce estimates of ultimate expected losses and the resulting incurred but not reported and loss development reserves. These methods use our specific historical claims data related to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case reserves, reported and closed claim counts, and a variety of hospital census information. Based on these analyses, we determine our estimate of the professional liability claims, including the incurred but not reported and loss development reserve estimates. The determination of our estimates involves subjective judgment and could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods if our actual experience is materially different than our assumptions. Malpractice claims generally take 4 to 5 years to settle from the time of the initial reporting of the occurrence to the settlement payment. Accordingly, the percentage of reserves as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009 representing unsettled claims is approximately 99%. 74 Table of Contents The following table, which includes both our continuing and discontinued operations, presents the amount of our accruals for professional liability claims and the corresponding activity therein: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Accrual for professional liability claims, beginning of the year $ 572 $ 663 $ 716 Expense (income) related to:(1) Current accident year 125 121 130 Prior accident years (98 ) (74 ) (39 ) Expense from discounting 10 9 24 Total incurred loss and loss expense 37 56 115 Paid claims and expenses related to: Current accident year (2 ) (1 ) (3 ) Prior accident years (140 ) (146 ) (165 ) Total paid claims and expenses (142 ) (147 ) (168 ) Accrual for professional liability claims, end of year $ 467 $ 572 $ 663 (1) Total malpractice expense for continuing operations, including premiums for insured coverage, was $57 million, $89 million and $126 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. ACCRUALS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS Our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts. The discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement. We evaluate this critical assumption annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Our discount rate for 2010 was 5.50% and for 2009 was 5.75%. The assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. A one hundred basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for 2011 by $3.0 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 by $28.6 million. A 100 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease net periodic pension expense for 2011 by $1.2 million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 by $24.1 million. ACCRUALS FOR LITIGATION LOSSES We record reserves for litigation losses if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss. If a range of loss can be reasonably estimated, but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. These estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS We evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, we calculate the amount of an impairment charge if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals, established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. The estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable. They require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates. These assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. We report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell. In such circumstances, our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows. 75 Table of Contents Fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods. Many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates, including the following risks: future financial results of our hospitals, which can be impacted by volumes of insured patients and declines in commercial managed care patients, terms of managed care payer arrangements, our ability to collect accounts due from uninsured and managed care payers, loss of volumes as a result of competition, and our ability to manage costs such as labor costs, which can be adversely impacted by union activity and the shortage of experienced nurses; changes in payments from governmental health care programs and in government regulations such as reductions to Medicare and Medicaid payment rates resulting from government legislation or rule making or from budgetary challenges of states in which we operate; how the hospitals are operated in the future; and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $5 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital, consistent with our prior estimates during 2009 and 2008 when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. Unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets, this hospital is at risk of future impairments, particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate or equipment continues to decline. The aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was $25 million as of December 31, 2010. Additionally, in our most recent impairment analysis as of December 31, 2010, we had two hospitals with an aggregate carrying value of long lived assets of approximately $205 million whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets by an aggregate amount of approximately $150 million. These two hospitals had the smallest excess of future undiscounted cash flows over carrying value. Changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates of future undiscounted cash flows could result in the hospitals estimated cash flows being less than the carrying value of the assets, which would require a fair value assessment of the long lived assets, and if the fair value amount is less than the carrying value of the assets, impairment charges would occur and could be material. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually. For goodwill, we perform the test at the reporting unit level, as defined by applicable accounting standards, when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually. If we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired, or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value, then we reduce the carrying value, including any allocated goodwill, to fair value. Estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. 76 Table of Contents Our continuing operations are structured as follows: Our California region includes all of our hospitals in California and Nebraska; Our Central region includes all of our hospitals in Missouri, Tennessee and Texas; Our Florida region includes all of our hospitals in Florida; Our Southern States region includes all of our hospitals in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina; and Our two hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania are part of a separate market. These regions and market are reporting units used to perform our goodwill impairment analysis and are one level below our operating segment level. Future restructuring of our regions or markets that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill. Our goodwill balance is primarily related to our Southern States region, which totals approximately $310 million, and our Central region, which totals approximately $297 million. In our latest impairment analysis as of December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value of these regions exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets, including goodwill, by approximately 36% and 48%, respectively. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities. Developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. We assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified, we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The main factors that we consider include: Cumulative profits/losses in recent years, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items; Income/losses expected in future years; Unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels; The availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits; and The carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2010, we had not included projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance primarily as a result of negative evidence represented by our cumulative losses in recent years. However, during the year ended December 31, 2010, our judgment about the need for a valuation allowance changed, and we concluded that the valuation allowance could be reduced to $66 million. As a result, the reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately $1.1 billion was recorded as a benefit in the provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Our change in judgment resulted from our assessment that positive evidence outweighed negative evidence during 2010 thereby resulting in the inclusion of projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance. The following factors were taken into account in our assessment: Cumulative profits for the three years ended December 31, 2010; Projected profits for 2011 based on current business plans; Carryforward periods for utilization of federal net operating loss carryovers; Significant improvement in operating performance in 2009 and 2010 as evidenced by: Improved cost controls; Successful renegotiation of managed care contracts on favorable terms; 77 Table of Contents Successful quality control initiatives as reflected by improved clinical outcomes; Successful execution of physician alignment strategies; and Expansion of our outpatient business; and Formulation of strategic initiatives to address uncertainties presented by the Affordable Care Act and health information technology requirements under ARRA. The remaining $66 million balance in the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to certain state net operating loss carryovers and federal tax credits that, more likely than not, will expire unutilized. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions, and such judgments are subject to periodic review. Tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied; (2) the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired. Tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied. While we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities, adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method, under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees, directors, advisors and consultants is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant, using a binomial lattice model. The key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include: Expected volatility; Expected dividend yield; Expected life; Expected forfeiture rate; Risk free interest rate range; Early exercise threshold; and Early exercise rate. The expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options. The expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options, and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges. The historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 due to unique events occurring during that time, which caused extreme volatility of our stock price. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. This model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price. The risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon United States Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes. The most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option, because it, in turn, is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates. Accordingly, we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date. Our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns. 78 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of December 31, 2010. The fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. At December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings with variable interest rates. Maturity Date, Years Ending December 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Fair Value (Dollars in Millions) Fixed rate long term debt $ 67 $ 59 $ 217 $ 60 $ 1,188 $ 2,670 $ 4,261 $ 4,528 Average effective interest rates 6.9 % 6.8 % 7.8 % 10.2 % 10.9 % 9.9 % 9.9 % At December 31, 2010, we had long term, market sensitive investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries. Our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as non current assets is substantially mitigated by the long term nature and type of the investments in the portfolio. At December 31, 2010, the net accumulated unrealized losses related to our captive insurance companies investment portfolios were less than $1 million. We have no affiliation with partnerships, trusts or other entities (sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities) whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements by us. Thus, we have no exposure to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risks associated with such entities. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. 79 Table of Contents
