ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The purpose of this section, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), is to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to better understand our business, to enhance our overall financial disclosures, to provide the context within which our financial information may be analyzed, and to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial and statistical information included herein relates to our continuing operations, with dollar amounts expressed in millions (except per share, per admission, per patient day, per adjusted patient day and per visit amounts). MD&A, which should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, includes the following sections: Management Overview Sources of Revenue Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Recently Issued Accounting Standards Critical Accounting Estimates MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW STRATEGY AND TRENDS We are committed to providing the communities our hospitals, outpatient centers and other health care facilities serve with high quality, cost effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long term value for our shareholders. We believe that our success in increasing our profitability depends in part on our success in executing the strategies and managing the trends discussed below. 27 Table of Contents Core Business Strategy At December 31, 2011, our subsidiaries operated 50 hospitals, including four academic medical centers and a critical access hospital, with a combined total of 13,453 licensed beds, serving primarily urban and suburban communities in 11 states. Our core business is focused on providing acute care treatment, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, radiology services and emergency medical treatment, as well as outpatient services. In supporting our core business, we seek to offer superior quality and patient services, to make capital and other investments in our facilities and technology to remain competitive, to recruit and retain physicians, and to negotiate favorable contracts with managed care and other commercial payers. In addition, we continually review our clinical service lines to determine which services are most highly valued and should be marketed to improve our operating results, and we strategically de emphasize or eliminate unprofitable service lines, if appropriate. Development Strategies We continue to focus on opportunities to increase our outpatient revenues through organic growth and the acquisition of selected outpatient businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we derived approximately 31% of our revenues before provision for doubtful accounts from outpatient services. Historically, our outpatient business has generated significantly higher margins for us than other business lines. By expanding our outpatient business, we expect to increase our profitability over time. We also intend to focus on acquiring hospitals, services providers and other health care assets and companies in markets where we believe our operating strategies can improve performance and create shareholder value. We believe that this growth by strategic acquisitions, when and if opportunities are available, can supplement the growth we believe we can generate organically in our existing markets. Expanding Our Conifer Health Solutions Business We intend to continue expanding our revenue cycle management, health care information management, management services, and patient communications services businesses under our Conifer Health Solutions (Conifer) subsidiary by marketing these services to non Tenet hospitals and other health care related entities. At December 31, 2011, Conifer provided services to more than 300 Tenet and non Tenet hospitals and other health care organizations. We believe this business has the potential over time to generate high margins and improve our results of operations. Commitment to Quality Through our Commitment to Quality and Medicare Performance Improvement initiatives, we continually work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care, while using labor management tools and supply chain initiatives to reduce variable costs. We believe the use of these practices will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay, as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients. As a result of our efforts, our hospitals have substantially improved in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care. Leveraging off of these initiatives, we expect to benefit over time from provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act) that tie certain payments to quality measures, establish a value based purchasing system, and adjust hospital payment rates based on hospital acquired conditions and hospital readmissions. In general, we believe that quality of care improvements may have the effect of reducing costs, increasing payments from Medicare and certain managed care payers for our services, and increasing physician and patient satisfaction, which may potentially improve our volumes. Realizing HIT Incentive Payments and Other Benefits During the year ended December 31, 2011, we achieved compliance with certain of the health information technology (HIT) requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA); as a result, we were able to recognize approximately $55 million of electronic health record incentives related to Medicaid ARRA HIT in 2011. These incentives, most of which were received by December 31, 2011, will partially offset the operating expenses we have incurred and continue to incur to invest in HIT systems. We also anticipate that we will be able to recognize Medicare and additional Medicaid ARRA HIT incentives in the year ending December 31, 2012. Furthermore, we believe that the operational benefits of HIT, including improved clinical outcomes and increased operating efficiencies, will contribute to our long term ability to grow our business. General Economic Conditions We believe that high unemployment rates and other adverse economic conditions are continuing to have a negative impact on our bad debt expense levels and patient volumes. However, as the economy recovers, we expect to experience improvements in these metrics relative to current levels. Improving Operating Leverage We are experiencing a gradual increase in patient volumes that we believe is primarily attributable to our focus on physician alignment and satisfaction, targeted capital spending on critical growth opportunities for our hospitals, emphasis on higher demand clinical service lines (including outpatient lines), the implementation of new payer contracting strategies, and improved quality metrics at our hospitals. Increases in patient volumes have been constrained by the slow pace of the current economic recovery, increased competition, utilization pressure by managed care organizations, the effects of higher patient co pays and deductibles, and demographic trends. 28 Table of Contents Impact of Affordable Care Act We anticipate that we will benefit over time from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that will extend insurance coverage through Medicaid or private insurance to a broader segment of the U.S. population. Although we are unable to predict the precise impact of the Affordable Care Act on our future results of operations, and while there will be some reductions in reimbursement rates, which began in 2010, we anticipate, based on the current timetable for implementing the law, that we could begin to receive reimbursement for caring for uninsured and underinsured patients as early as 2014. We believe we are well positioned relative to other health care companies to benefit from extended insurance coverage given the concentration of our operations in California, Florida and Texas, which states historically have higher percentages of uninsured and underinsured patients compared to the national average. Our ability to execute on these strategies and manage these trends is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from expectations. For information about these risks and uncertainties, see the Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in Part I of this report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide and company specific challenges, including constrained volume growth, decreased demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt, that have affected our revenue growth and operating expenses. We believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect recent trends we are experiencing with respect to volumes, revenues and expenses; therefore, we have provided below information about these metrics for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 for all of our continuing operations hospitals. Three Months Ended December 31, Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Total admissions 127,321 126,977 0.3 % Paying admissions (excludes charity and uninsured) 118,545 118,583 % Charity and uninsured admissions 8,776 8,394 4.6 % Admissions through emergency department 77,075 74,648 3.3 % Paying admissions as a percentage of total admissions 93.1 % 93.4 % (0.3 )%(1) Charity and uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions 6.9 % 6.6 % 0.3 %(1) Emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions 60.5 % 58.8 % 1.7 %(1) Surgeries inpatient 36,284 37,448 (3.1 )% Surgeries outpatient 56,407 52,411 7.6 % Total surgeries 92,691 89,859 3.2 % Patient days total 599,859 608,890 (1.5 )% Adjusted patient days(2) 917,798 923,219 (0.6 )% Average length of stay (days) 4.7 4.8 (0.1 )(1) Adjusted patient admissions(2) 196,594 194,099 1.3 % (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. (2) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Total admissions increased by 344, or 0.3%, in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. Three of our four regions reported admissions increases in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. Total surgeries increased by 3.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. While our emergency department admissions increased 3.3% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year, we believe the current economic conditions continue to have an adverse impact on the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals, which constrained the overall change in our total admissions. 29 Table of Contents Three Months Ended December 31, Outpatient Visits 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Total visits 1,002,842 999,827 0.3 % Paying visits (excludes charity and uninsured) 901,821 900,182 0.2 % Charity and uninsured visits 101,021 99,645 1.4 % Emergency department visits 370,381 359,168 3.1 % Surgery visits 56,407 52,411 7.6 % Paying visits as a percentage of total visits 89.9 % 90.0 % (0.1 )%(1) Charity and uninsured visits as a percentage of total visits 10.1 % 10.0 % 0.1 %(1) (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. We had an increase of 3,015 total outpatient visits, or 0.3%, in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. Two of our four regions reported increased outpatient visits in the three months ended December 31, 2011, with the strongest improvement occurring in our Southern States region. We had 554 flu related visits in the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to 1,618 flu related visits in the same period in 2010. Outpatient surgery visits increased by 7.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. Charity and uninsured outpatient visits increased by 1.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. Three Months Ended December 31, Revenues 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Net operating revenues $ 2,226 $ 2,111 5.4 % Revenues from the uninsured $ 160 $ 154 3.9 % Net inpatient revenues(1) $ 1,536 $ 1,477 4.0 % Net outpatient revenues(1) $ 751 $ 730 2.9 % (1) Net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues. Net inpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $73 million and $66 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net outpatient revenues include self pay revenues of $87 million and $88 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net operating revenues increased by $115 million, or 5.4%, for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. Net operating revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2011 included a $14 million increase in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) revenues and other state funded subsidy payments in the 2011 period compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to $28 million of net revenues related to the California supplemental Medi Cal payments program for the program period January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011 that was approved by CMS during the three months ended December 31, 2011. In addition to certain of the factors discussed above, net patient revenues increased by 3.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 primarily as a result of managed care pricing improvement. Three Months Ended December 31, Revenues on a Per Admission, Per Patient Day and Per Visit Basis 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Net inpatient revenue per admission $ 12,064 $ 11,632 3.7 % Net inpatient revenue per patient day $ 2,561 $ 2,426 5.6 % Net outpatient revenue per visit $ 749 $ 730 2.6 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient admission(1) $ 11,633 $ 11,370 2.3 % Net patient revenue per adjusted patient day(1) $ 2,492 $ 2,391 4.2 % (1) Adjusted patient days/admissions represents actual patient days/admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days/admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Inpatient unit revenue improvement was evident across all key metrics, primarily reflecting the improved terms of our managed care contracts in the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net outpatient revenue per visit was primarily due to improved terms of our managed care contracts, the 7.6% increase in outpatient surgery visits in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 and favorable cost report 30 Table of Contents adjustments in the 2011 period, partially offset by the impact of increased imaging visits, which typically have a lower associated per visit revenue. Three Months Ended December 31, Provision for Doubtful Accounts 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Provision for doubtful accounts $ 185 $ 190 (2.6 )% Provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts 7.7 % 8.3 % (0.6 )%(1) Collection rate on self pay accounts(2) 27.8 % 28.3 % (0.5 )%(1) Collection rate on commercial managed care accounts 98.2 % 98.4 % (0.2 )%(1) (1) The change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. (2) Self pay accounts receivable are comprised of both uninsured and balance after insurance receivables. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $5 million, or 2.6%, in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease in provision for doubtful accounts primarily related to the favorable impact from our quarterly collection rate update in the 2011 period and the deterioration in the age of our managed care receivables in the three months ended December 31, 2010 that did not occur in the same period in 2011, partially offset by the impact of a 50 basis point decline in our collection rate on self pay accounts. Our self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 27.8% as of December 31, 2011 from 28.3% as of December 31, 2010. Three Months Ended December 31, Selected Operating Expenses 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Salaries, wages and benefits $ 1,029 $ 967 6.4 % Supplies 391 394 (0.8 )% Other operating expenses 517 469 10.2 % Total $ 1,937 $ 1,830 5.8 % Rent/lease expense(1) $ 39 $ 35 11.4 % Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day(2) $ 1,121 $ 1,047 7.1 % Supplies per adjusted patient day(2) 426 427 (0.2 )% Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day(2) 563 508 10.8 % Total per adjusted patient day $ 2,110 $ 1,982 6.5 % (1) Included in other operating expenses. (2) Adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. Total selected operating expenses, which is defined as salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses, increased by 6.5% on a per adjusted patient day basis in the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased by 7.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. This increase is primarily due to annual merit increases for our employees, an increase in the number of physicians we employ and higher health benefits costs. Supplies expense per adjusted patient day decreased by 0.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. Supplies expense was favorably impacted by a decline in orthopedic and cardiology related costs due to renegotiated prices and lower volume levels, partially offset by increased costs of surgical supplies. In general, supplies expense changes are primarily attributable to changes in our patient volume levels and the mix of procedures performed. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by 10.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. This change is primarily due to increased physician and medical fees, higher malpractice expense, increased costs of contracted services, and increased physician relocation and income guarantee costs. Malpractice expense in the 2011 period includes approximately $1 million of expense due to an eight basis point decrease in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities compared to a $10 million favorable adjustment as a result of an 80 basis point increase in the interest rate in the 2010 period. 31 Table of Contents Our estimated direct and allocated costs (based on selected operating expenses, which include salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses) of caring for uninsured patients were $108 million and $92 million in the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The table below shows the pre tax and after tax impact on continuing operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 of the following items: Three Months Ended December 31 Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010 (Expense) Income Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges $ (9 ) $ (9 ) $ (27 ) $ (10 ) Litigation and investigation costs (31 ) (6 ) (55 ) (12 ) Loss from early extinguishment of debt (117 ) (2 ) (117 ) (57 ) Pre tax impact $ (157 ) $ (17 ) $ (199 ) $ (79 ) Deferred tax asset valuation allowance and other tax adjustments $ (8 ) $ 23 $ 8 $ 1,043 Total after tax impact $ (108 ) $ 9 $ (118 ) $ 993 Diluted per share impact of above items $ (0.25 ) $ 0.02 $ (0.24 ) $ 1.78 Diluted earnings per share, including above items $ (0.15 ) $ 0.10 $ 0.13 $ 2.01 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Cash and cash equivalents were $113 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $72 million from $185 million at September 30, 2011. Significant cash flow items in the three months ended December 31, 2011 included: $24 million of collections related to state Medicaid electronic health record incentives under the HIT provisions of ARRA; Capital expenditures of $177 million; Preferred stock dividend payments of $6 million; Income tax payments of $19 million; Payments on reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs of $17 million; Interest payments of $92 million; $28 million of payments to acquire various outpatient and physician practice businesses; $23 million of proceeds from the sale of seven medical office buildings in Texas; and $178 million of payments to repurchase common stock. Net cash provided by operating activities was $497 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $472 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the 2011 and 2010 periods include the following: Increased income from continuing operations before income taxes of $95 million, excluding investment earnings, loss from early extinguishment of debt, interest expense, litigation and investigation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, and depreciation and amortization, in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010; Lower interest payments of $55 million; 32 Table of Contents $30 million of proceeds from the interest rate swap agreement we terminated in August 2011, which generated approximately $8 million of cash interest savings and $22 million in proceeds from the termination of the agreement; Reduced cash flows associated with various changes in working capital and changes in long term liabilities, including the following: a $13 million receivable as of December 31, 2011 that is expected to be collected in 2012 related to state Medicaid electronic health record incentives under the HIT provisions of ARRA; a $16 million receivable recorded as of December 31, 2011 related to the California supplemental Medi Cal payment program that was approved by CMS in the three months ended December 31, 2011, which resulted in the recognition of $28 million of net revenues in the period; a $6 million receivable recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid by us prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents that we expect will be refunded to us in 2012; and $77 million of reduced net cash flows in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period related to accounts receivable primarily due to payment delays by certain government payers and a temporary delay in the adjudication of accounts receivable due to processing changes we implemented to capture long term operating efficiencies, partially offset by our management of liabilities; Income tax payments of $10 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to income tax refunds of $34 million in the year ended December 31, 2010; Lower aggregate annual 401(k) matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of $20 million ($85 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $105 million in the year ended December 31, 2010); Lower payments on reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs of $39 million; and $47 million of additional cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations (including approximately $13 million in payments relating to the settlement of two class action lawsuits resulting from Hurricane Katrina). SOURCES OF REVENUE We receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources, primarily managed care payers and the federal Medicare program, as well as state Medicaid programs, indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients (that is, patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement). The table below shows the sources of net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts for our general hospitals, expressed as percentages of net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts from all sources: Years Ended December 31, Net Patient Revenues from: 2011 2010 2009 Medicare 23.2 % 23.9 % 25.0 % Medicaid 9.0 % 8.7 % 8.1 % Managed care 57.0 % 56.5 % 56.1 % Indemnity, self pay and other 10.8 % 10.9 % 10.8 % 33 Table of Contents Our payer mix on an admissions basis for our general hospitals, expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources, is shown below: Years Ended December 31, Admissions from: 2011 2010 2009 Medicare 29.6 % 29.9 % 30.0 % Medicaid 12.9 % 13.0 % 12.3 % Managed care 47.7 % 47.6 % 48.5 % Indemnity, self pay and other 9.8 % 9.5 % 9.2 % GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS The Medicare program, the nations largest health insurance program, is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals 65 years of age and older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with end stage renal disease, and is provided without regard to income or assets. Medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources, and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nations poor and most vulnerable individuals. As enacted, the Affordable Care Act will change how health care services under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs are covered, delivered and reimbursed. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expands eligibility under existing Medicaid programs to non pregnant adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning in 2014. Further, the law permits states to create federally funded, non Medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for Medicaid. However, the Affordable Care Act also contains a number of provisions designed to significantly reduce Medicare and Medicaid program spending, including: (1) negative adjustments to the annual market basket updates for Medicare inpatient, outpatient, long term acute and inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment systems, which began in 2010, as well as additional productivity adjustments that began in 2011; and (2) reductions to Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in 2013 as the number of uninsured individuals declines. We are unable to predict with certainty the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the laws complexity, the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual or potentially delayed implementation, the pending U.S. Supreme Court review and possible amendment. However, we expect that several provisions of the Affordable Care Act will have a material effect on our business. In addition to the changes affected by the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative and judicial rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future, as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced, if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited, or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government health care program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents Medicare Medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits. One option, the Original Medicare Plan, is a fee for service payment system. The other option, called Medicare Advantage (sometimes called Part C or MA Plans), includes health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), private fee for service Medicare special needs plans and Medicare medical savings account plans. The major components of our net patient revenues for hospital services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are set forth in the table below: Years Ended December 31, Revenue Descriptions 2011 2010 2009 Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group operating $ 1,147 $ 1,171 $ 1,191 Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group capital 103 106 109 Outliers 46 51 68 Outpatient 474 453 421 Disproportionate share 219 215 219 Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education(1) 110 110 111 Other(2) 72 53 76 Adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances (1 ) (15 ) 10 Total Medicare net patient revenues $ 2,170 $ 2,144 $ 2,205 (1) Includes Indirect Medical Education revenue earned by our childrens hospital under the Childrens Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment Program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration of HHS. (2) The other revenue category includes one skilled nursing facility (which we sold in the three months ended June 30, 2009), inpatient psychiatric units, one inpatient rehabilitation hospital (which we closed in the three months ended March 31, 2009), inpatient rehabilitation units, one long term acute care hospital, other revenue adjustments, and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances. A general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the Original Medicare Plan is provided below. Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found below under Regulatory and Legislative Changes. Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System Medicare Severity Adjusted Diagnosis Related Group Payments Sections 1886(d) and 1886(g) of the Social Security Act (the Act) set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system (PPS). Under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), Medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge. Discharges are classified according to a system of Medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups (MS DRGs), which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources. CMS assigns to each MS DRG a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular MS DRG, relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all MS DRGs. The base payment amount for the operating component of the MS DRG payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share. Both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs, respectively. Using diagnosis and procedure information submitted by the hospital, CMS assigns to each discharge an MS DRG, and the base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the MS DRG assigned. The MS DRG operating and capital base rates, relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually, with consideration given to: the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals; the relative costs associated with each MS DRG; and changes in labor data by geographic area. Although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials, the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospitals operating and capital costs. Outlier Payments Outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals on individual claims for treating Medicare patients whose medical conditions are costlier to treat than those of the average patient in the same MS DRG. To qualify for a cost outlier payment, a hospitals billed charges, adjusted to cost, must exceed the payment rate for the MS DRG by a fixed threshold established annually by CMS. A Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospitals most recently filed cost report. Generally, if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the MS DRG payment plus the fixed threshold, the hospital receives 80% of the difference as an outlier payment. 35 Table of Contents Under the Act, CMS must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all PPS hospitals to be not less than 5% or more than 6% of total MS DRG payments (Outlier Percentage). The Outlier Percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of MS DRG and outlier payments. CMS annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit. A change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing: (1) the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments; and (2) the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify for outlier payments. Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients. DSH payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by CMS and are calculated as a percentage add on to the MS DRG payments. During 2011, 42 of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for DSH payments. The primary method for a hospital to qualify for DSH payments is based on a complex statutory formula that results in a DSH percentage that is applied to payments based on MS DRGs. The hospital specific DSH percentage is equal to the sum of the percentage of Medicare inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for both the Traditional Medicare Plan (Part A) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) percentage, and the percentage of total inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for Medicaid but not Medicare Part A. Hospitals receive interim DSH payments that are reconciled in the annual cost report. CMS develops and distributes the hospital specific SSI percentages, typically one year after the close of the federal fiscal year (FFY); however, the release of the SSI percentages has been delayed in recent years as CMS continues to examine and refine the data. Historically, the SSI percentage included only patient days paid under Part A. However, the FFY 2007 SSI percentages CMS released in June 2009 reflect a policy change to include the Part C days in the ratio. The 2007 SSI percentages will be used to settle our 2007 cost reports. As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $23 million as our initial estimate of the impact of using the FFY 2007 SSI ratios. During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we learned that CMS had instructed the MACs to suspend the settlement of all cost reports (including ours) in which the 2007 SSI percentages would be used. However, the MACs are authorized to use the 2007 SSI percentages for current DSH interim payments and tentative settlements for post 2007 cost reporting periods pending the release of revised 2007 SSI percentages and the 2008 and subsequent SSI percentages. The cost report settlement suspension is still in effect, and we cannot predict with certainty when the suspension will be removed. CMS has not yet released the FFYs 2008, 2009 and 2010 SSI ratios. According to the CMS website, revised FFYs 2007 and 2008 SSI ratios that will include the Part C data were to be posted on the website in 2011; however, the website has not yet been updated. A 2011 U.S. Court of Appeals decision invalidated the inclusion of the Part C days in the SSI ratios for certain earlier periods; however, the proper treatment of the Part C days for periods after October 2004 remains unresolved. CMS has not indicated it intends to change its policy in this regard. As a result, in the three months ended June 30, 2010, we revised our estimate of the impact of using the FFY 2007 SSI ratios for the calculation of Medicare DSH payments for our non teaching hospitals for 2007 and subsequent periods to reflect the inclusion of the estimated Part C days in the FFY 2007 SSI ratios, and we recorded an unfavorable adjustment to Medicare net revenue of $20 million ($14 million related to prior years and $6 million related to the year ended December 31, 2010). We intend to continue to pursue a reversal of CMS policy in this regard through the administrative and judicial appeal process; however, we cannot predict the outcome or timing of the appeals. The Medicare DSH statutes and regulations have been the subject of various administrative appeals and lawsuits, and our hospitals have been included in these appeals for several years. These types of appeals generally take several years to resolve, in particular for multi hospital organizations, because of CMS administrative appeal rules. The appeals have been further delayed due to CMS general moratorium on the release of information critical to certain elements of these appeals. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the DSH appeals for our hospitals, but a favorable outcome could have a material impact on our future revenues and cash flows. Direct Graduate and Indirect Medical Education Payments The Medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions. This additional reimbursement, which is subject to certain limits, including intern and resident full time equivalent (FTE) limits, is made in the form of Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME) payments. During 2011, 13 of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments. Medicare rules permit teaching hospitals to enter into Medicare Graduate Medical Education Affiliation Agreements for the purpose of applying the FTE limits on an aggregate basis, and some of our teaching hospitals have entered into such agreements. Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Under the outpatient prospective payment system, hospital outpatient services, except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule, are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (APCs). Services in each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require, and a payment rate is established for each APC. 36 Table of Contents Depending on the services provided, hospitals may be paid for more than one APC for an encounter. CMS periodically updates the APCs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each APC. Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System The inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system (IPF PPS) applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system. The IPF PPS is based on prospectively determined per diem rates and includes an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases. Inpatient Rehabilitation Prospective Payment System Rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by CMS are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) under the IRF prospective payment system (IRF PPS). Payments under the IRF PPS are made on a per discharge basis. A patient classification system is used to assign patients in IRFs into case mix groups. The IRF PPS uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups. To be paid under the IRF PPS, each hospital or unit must demonstrate on an annual basis that at least 60% of its total population had either a principal or secondary diagnosis that fell within one or more of the qualifying conditions designated in the Medicare regulations governing IRFs. As of December 31, 2011, all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required 60% threshold. Physician Services Payment System Medicare pays for physician and other professional services based on a list of services and their payment rates, called the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). In determining payment rates for each service on the fee schedule, CMS considers the amount of work required to provide a service, expenses related to maintaining a practice, and liability insurance costs. The values given to these three types of resources are adjusted by variations in the input prices in different markets, and then a total is multiplied by a standard dollar amount, called the fee schedules conversion factor, to arrive at the payment amount. Medicares payment rates may be adjusted based on provider characteristics, additional geographic designations and other factors. The conversion factor updates payments for physician services every year according to a formula called the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system. This formula is intended to keep spending growth (a function of service volume growth) consistent with growth in the national economy. However, in the last several years, Congress has specified an update outside of the SGR formula. Cost Reports The final determination of certain Medicare payments to our hospitals, such as DSH, DGME, IME and bad debt expense, are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports. The final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives, providers rights of appeal, and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. For filed cost reports, we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. Typically, the MACs settle cost reports within two years after the end of the cost reporting period; however, due to the aforementioned CMS suspension of issuing cost report settlements nationwide, our Medicare cost reports for periods ended on and after December 31, 2007 have not yet been settled. We cannot predict when CMS will remove the settlement suspension. 37 Table of Contents Medicaid Medicaid programs and the corresponding reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year. Estimated revenues under various state Medicaid programs, excluding state funded managed care Medicaid programs, constituted approximately 9.0%, 8.7% and 8.1% of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also receive DSH payments under various state Medicaid programs. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our revenues attributable to DSH payments and other state funded subsidy payments were approximately $260 million, $181 million and $171 million, respectively. Several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Because most states must operate with balanced budgets, and the Medicaid program is generally a significant portion of a states budget, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting future legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The economic downturn has increased budget pressures on most states, and these budget pressures have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in decreased spending for Medicaid programs in many states. Most states began a new fiscal year on July 1, 2011 and, although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets, some states are still facing budget gaps. Increased Medicaid enrollment due to the economic downturn, limits on the ability of states to reduce Medicaid eligibility criteria enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, budget gaps and other factors could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments or additional taxes on hospitals. Some states are considering proposals that would result in such reductions. As an alternative means of funding provider payments, several states in which we operate have adopted or are considering adopting broad based provider taxes to fund the non federal share of Medicaid programs. Some states, such as California and Pennsylvania, as described below, have introduced provider fee arrangements, which are intended to enhance funding or partially mitigate reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Because we cannot predict what actions the federal government or the states may take under existing legislation and future legislation to address budget gaps or deficits, we are unable to assess the effect that any such legislation might have on our business, but the impact on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be material. Medicaid related patient revenues recognized by our continuing general hospitals from Medicaid related programs in the states in which they are located, as well as from Medicaid programs in neighboring states, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are set forth in the table below: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Medicaid Managed Medicaid Medicaid Managed Medicaid Medicaid Managed Medicaid California $ 221 $ 127 $ 137 $ 111 $ 125 $ 99 Florida 184 60 194 55 182 56 Pennsylvania 91 195 53 161 53 157 Georgia 88 40 87 40 73 41 Texas 64 114 66 109 67 107 Missouri 52 5 81 6 75 6 South Carolina 40 22 61 20 52 17 Alabama 30 26 14 North Carolina 23 26 27 Nebraska 22 7 24 6 23 6 Tennessee 10 30 9 27 9 30 $ 825 $ 600 $ 764 $ 535 $ 700 $ 519 In October 2009, the Governor of California signed legislation supported by the hospital industry to impose a provider fee on general acute care hospitals that, combined with federal matching funds, would be used to provide supplemental Medi Cal payments to hospitals, as well as provide the state with $320 million annually for childrens health care coverage, for the 21 month period retroactive to April 2009 and expiring on December 31, 2010 (the 21 Month Program). On January 18, 2011, CMS issued the final required federal approval of the program, which allowed us to recognize $63 million of additional revenues, net of provider fees and other expenses, during the three months ended March 31, 2011. We made $5 million of our required payments and received approximately $59 million in additional supplemental proceeds during 2011 related to the 21 Month Program, and we received $9 million of receipts in excess of payments related to this program in 2010. 38 Table of Contents On April 13, 2011, the Governor of California signed legislation that created a fee program to provide supplemental Medi Cal payments to hospitals retroactive to January 1, 2011 and expiring on June 30, 2011 (the Six Month Program). On December 30, 2011, CMS issued the final required federal approval of the program, which allowed us to recognize $28 million of additional revenues, net of provider fees and other expenses, during the three months ended December 31, 2011. We made $44 million of our required payments and received approximately $56 million in additional supplemental proceeds during 2011 related to the Six Month Program. On September 16, 2011, the Governor of California signed legislation, similar to the 21 Month and Six Month Programs described above, that created a fee program to provide supplemental Medi Cal payments to hospitals retroactive to July 1, 2011 and expiring on December 31, 2013 (the 30 Month Program). To date, CMS has not issued any approvals in connection with the 30 Month Program. Based on the most recent California Hospital Association estimates, the 30 Month Program could result in approximately $210 million of net revenues for our California hospitals. We expect to record the additional net revenues, net of provider fees and other expenses, ratably over 30 months (which will be calculated based on the program being retroactive to July 2011) beginning in the period CMS issues the required approvals of the 30 Month Program. We cannot provide any assurances regarding the final approval of the 30 Month Program by CMS or the timing or amount of the payments we may ultimately receive or be required to make. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, CMS issued final approval of Pennsylvanias Medical Assistance payment system, which includes, among other things, a three year provider fee program for the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2013. Net operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011 included approximately $39 million related to the program, of which the portion related to the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $13 million. Based on estimates prepared by the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, this program is expected to result in approximately $24 million of additional net revenues for our Pennsylvania hospitals in the state fiscal year 2012 (July 1, 2011 June 30, 2012). In March 2011, the State of Georgia adopted an amended budget for the state fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 that included additional funding for payments to private hospitals from the Indigent Care Trust Fund (ICTF), the states disproportionate share program. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, we received payments to our hospitals from the ICTF of approximately $13 million, of which $10 million was recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2011, and the portion related to 2010 was approximately $7 million. The Governor of Georgia has proposed an amended budget for the state fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 that includes a provision to again fund the private hospital ICTF; however, the proposal must be approved by the state legislature. We cannot provide any assurances regarding the amount, if any, of ICTF payments we might receive for the current state fiscal year. Based on a recent audit of Missouris 2005 2007 Medicaid plan years, it was determined that excess DSH payments were made to hospitals and that excess payments were likely in 2011. Effective June 1, 2011, the State of Missouri Department of Social Services Medicaid Division implemented an emergency rule that allows it to recoup state fiscal year 2011 (July 2010 June 2011) DSH payments from hospitals with DSH longfalls (i.e., payments in excess of costs) and redistribute the funds to hospitals with DSH shortfalls (i.e., payments lower than costs). The state implemented this rule on an emergency basis as it allows the state to redistribute DSH payments to hospitals in accordance with CMS audit requirements. In September 2011, the state issued notices of the estimated overpayments to the affected hospitals. Based on these notices, the estimated amount that we have to repay as a result of this emergency rule is approximately $12 million. We are currently challenging the recoupment and redistribution; however, we cannot predict the outcome of such action. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2011, we recorded a liability of approximately $12 million for this matter. We were recently advised that collection of the liability has been placed in abeyance pending the outcome of our appeal. Regulatory and Legislative Changes Recent regulatory and legislative updates to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems are provided below. Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System Under Medicare law, CMS is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system. The updates generally become effective October 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. On August 1, 2011, CMS issued the Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and Fiscal Year 2012 Rates (Final Rule). The Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: A market basket increase of 3.0% for MS DRG operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data (hospitals that do not report specified quality measure data will receive an increase of 1.0%); CMS 39 Table of Contents also made certain adjustments to the estimated 3.0% market basket increase that will result in a net market basket update of 1.0%, including the following adjustments to the market basket index: Market basket index and productivity reductions required by the Affordable Care Act of 0.10% and 1.0%, respectively; A reduction of 2.0% to permanently remove approximately one half of the estimated 3.9% documentation and coding adjustment resulting from the conversion to MS DRGs; CMS did not indicate when it will remove the remaining 1.9%, however, CMS did indicate that it is feasible that all or most of the adjustment could be made in FFY 2013; and An increase of 1.1% to prospectively correct an error in the standardized rate related to the rural floor budget neutrality adjustment that occurred in prior years; A 0.34% net increase in the capital federal MS DRG rate; and A decrease in the cost outlier threshold from $23,075 to $22,385. The Final Rule also adopts for FFY 2014 a measure relating to Medicare spending per beneficiary for both the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program and the new Hospital Inpatient Value Based Purchasing program required by the Affordable Care Act. The new measure will assess Part A and Part B beneficiary spending during a period of time that spans from three days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after the patient is discharged. The goal is to encourage hospitals to provide high quality care to Medicare beneficiaries at a lower cost and to promote greater efficiencies, including measures to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions across patient care settings throughout the entire U.S. health care system. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes will yield an average 1.2% increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas (populations over one million). Using the impact percentages in the Final Rule as applied to our IPPS payments for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011, the estimated annual impact for all changes in the Final Rule on our hospitals is an increase in our Medicare inpatient revenues of approximately $16 million. Because of the uncertainty associated with various factors that may influence our future IPPS payments by individual hospital, including admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. Payment Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System On July 29, 2011, CMS issued a final rule that implements certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act and updates the prospective payment rates for the Medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system for FFY 2012 (IRF PPS Final Rule). The IRF PPS Final Rule, as subsequently corrected on September 26, 2011, includes the following payment changes: A net payment increase for IRFs of 1.8%, which reflects a market basket index increase of 2.9%, reduced by a productivity adjustment of 1.0% and an additional 0.1%, both as required by the Affordable Care Act, as well as other adjustments, including a budget neutrality reduction; and A decrease in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from $11,410 to $10,713. The IRF PPS Final Rule also implements Section 3004 of the Affordable Care Act, which establishes a new quality reporting program that provides for a 2% reduction in the annual IRF PPS increase factor beginning in 2014 for IRFs that fail to report quality data. At December 31, 2011, eight of our general hospitals operated inpatient rehabilitation units. CMS projects that the payment changes in the IRF PPS Final Rule will result in an estimated total increase in aggregate IRF payments of 2.2%. This estimated increase includes an average 2.3% increase for rehabilitation units in hospitals located in urban areas for FFY 2012. Using the urban rehabilitation unit impact percentage as applied to our Medicare IRF payments for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011, the annual impact of the payment changes in the IRF PPS Final Rule may result in an estimated increase in our Medicare revenues of less than $1 million. Because of the uncertainty associated with various factors that may influence our future IRF payments, including legislative action, admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, and the impact of compliance with IRF admission criteria, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes. 40 Table of Contents Payment Changes to the Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System On April 28, 2011, CMS issued a final rule updating the prospective payment rates for the Medicare inpatient psychiatric facility (IPF) PPS for the rate year beginning July 1, 2011 (IPF PPS Final Rule). The IPF PPS Final Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: A change to the IPF PPS rate update period to a rate year that coincides with the FFY effective October 1, 2011 that will apply to discharges beginning July 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012; and An update to IPF PPS payments equal to the market basket of 3.2% for the 15 month rate year period minus a 0.25% reduction required by the Affordable Care Act and a 0.21% reduction due to an update of the fixed dollar loss threshold. At December 31, 2011, 11 of our general hospitals operated inpatient psychiatric units reimbursed under the IPF PPS. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes included in the IPF PPS Final Rule will yield an average 2.74% increase in payments for all IPFs (including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals) and an average 2.43% increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas for the 15 month rate period beginning July 1, 2011. Using the urban psychiatric unit impact percentage as applied to our IPF PPS payments for the 12 months ended June 30, 2011, the annual impact of all payment and policy changes in the IPF PPS Final Rule on our IPF PPS psychiatric units may result in an estimated increase in our Medicare revenues of approximately $1 million. Because of the uncertainty associated with various factors that may influence our future IPF PPS payments, including legislative action, admission volumes, length of stay and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of the aforementioned changes. Payment and Policy Changes to the Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System On November 1, 2011, CMS released the Final Changes to the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and Calendar Year (CY) 2012 Payment Rates (Final OPPS Rule). The Final OPPS Rule includes the following payment and policy changes: A net update to OPPS payments equal to the estimated market basket of 1.9%, which takes into account a projected hospital OPPS market basket percentage increase of 3.0%, minus an estimated productivity adjustment of 1.0% and a 0.1% adjustment, both of which are necessary to comply with certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act; A budget neutrality reduction of 0.2% in payments for non cancer OPPS hospitals to fund an increase in OPPS payments to cancer hospitals mandated under the Affordable Care Act; and The addition of three quality measures to the current list of 23 outpatient measures that hospitals would have to report for determining CY 2014 payments. CMS projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the Final OPPS Rule will yield an average 1.9% increase in payments for all hospitals and an average 2.0% increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas (populations over one million). According to CMS estimates, the projected annual impact of the payment and policy changes in the final OPPS Rule on our hospitals is an $8 million increase in our Medicare outpatient revenues. Because of the uncertainty associated with various factors that may influence our future OPPS payments by individual hospital, including patient volumes and case mix, we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate. Changes to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule On November 1, 2011, CMS issued the CY 2012 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule (MPFS Final Rule) detailing Medicare physician payment policies for 2012. The rule confirmed that, unless Congress intervened, Medicares physician payments were scheduled to decrease in January 2012 by 27.4%. On January 4, 2012, the President signed the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act into law, which prevented the scheduled 27.4% cut in Medicare physician payments from being implemented on January 1, 2012 and extended the CY 2011 rates through February 29, 2012. In February 2012, the President signed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (the Job Creation Act) into law, which further extended the CY 2011 rates through December 31, 2012. Because the legislation does not change the underlying formula for calculating rates, it is projected that physician rates will be reduced by more than 30% on January 1, 2013 unless additional legislation is enacted. 41 Table of Contents Affordable Care Act As enacted, the Affordable Care Act will change how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth and other reductions in Medicare program spending, and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. In addition, a disproportionately large percentage of the new Medicaid coverage is likely to be in states that currently have relatively low income eligibility requirements. Two such states are Florida and Texas, where nearly half of our licensed beds are currently located. On the other hand, the Affordable Care Act provides for significant reductions in Medicare market basket updates and reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments. Given that approximately 32.2% of our net patient revenues in 2011 were from Medicare and Medicaid, reductions to these programs may significantly impact us and could offset any positive effects of the Affordable Care Act. We are unable to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the laws complexity and the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, as well as our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the law. Furthermore, many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until 2014 or later. In addition, the Affordable Care Act will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply with new federal mandates, such as the requirement to establish health insurance exchanges and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities, and we are unable to predict the timing and impact of such changes at this time. It is also possible that implementation of the Affordable Care Act could be delayed or even blocked due to court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the law. Because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of (1) the expected increases in volumes and revenues and decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals, (2) the reductions in Medicare spending, (3) the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH funding, and (4) numerous other provisions in the Affordable Care Act legislation that may affect us. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was enacted to stimulate the U.S. economy. The law created federal tax incentives, expanded unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions, and increased domestic spending on education, infrastructure and health care, including $31 billion in new spending on health information technology, most of which is for incentive Medicare and Medicaid payments to physicians and hospitals. ARRA requires that hospitals and physicians become meaningful users of electronic health records (EHRs) and submit quality data as a condition of receiving the incentive payments, which began in 2011. On July 13, 2010, CMS issued two final rules related to the adoption and dissemination of EHRs. One of the rules defines the meaningful use requirements that hospitals and other providers must meet to qualify for federal incentive payments for adopting EHRs under ARRA, and the other final rule describes the technical capabilities required for certified EHR technology. The Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Program provides incentive payments to eligible hospitals, physicians and certain other professionals (Providers) as they adopt, implement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in their first year of participation and demonstrate meaningful use for up to five remaining participation years. Medicaid EHR incentive payments to Providers are 100% federally funded; however, the Medicaid EHR incentive program is voluntarily offered by individual states. As of December 31, 2011, all but one state (Nebraska) in which we operate had received the required CMS approval of their Medicaid EHR plans. If we are able to achieve full compliance at all of our hospitals by 2013, we could receive approximately $345 million in total estimated combined Medicare and Medicaid hospital EHR incentive payments. However, based on the timeframe we anticipate it will take for us to achieve full compliance with the HIT requirements, it is unlikely that we will be able to realize the maximum amount of incentive payments of $345 million. We will be required to make investments in HIT through 2014 in excess of $600 million ($255 million of which had already been invested as of December 31, 2011) compared to approximately $320 million of Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments, some of which we were able to recognize in 2011, as described below. The Medicare incentive payments to individual hospitals are made over a four year, front weighted transition period. The Medicaid incentive payments, which are administered by the states, are subject to more flexible payment and compliance standards than Medicare incentive payments; hospitals that achieve compliance between 2014 and 2015 will receive reduced incentive payments during the transition period. We anticipate that, in addition to the expenditures we incur to qualify 42 Table of Contents for these incentive payments, our operating expenses have increased and will increase in the future as a result of these information system investments. Much or all of these expenditures may have been made by us as a part of our clinical systems enhancements, but would not have been incurred in the timeline to comply with the incentive payment requirements of ARRA. However, we anticipate there will be other operational benefits that we can realize as a result of these HIT enhancements that are not included in the above amounts. Hospitals that fail to become meaningful users of EHRs or fail to submit quality data by 2015 will be subject to penalties in the form of a reduction to Medicare payments. This reduction, which will be based on the market basket update, will be phased in over three years and will continue until a hospital achieves compliance. Using an estimated market basket of 2.9% and our annual Medicare inpatient net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, should all of our hospitals fail to become meaningful users of EHRs and fail to submit quality data, the penalties would result in reductions to our annual Medicare traditional inpatient net revenues of approximately $11 million, $21 million and $32 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017 and subsequent years, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we acquired certified EHR technology for all of our acute care hospitals and certain of our employed physicians. As a result, we recognized approximately $55 million of EHR incentives related to the Medicaid EHR incentive program, a significant portion of which was received during the three months ended December 31, 2011 pursuant to the ARRA HIT programs in the various states in which we operate that received CMS approval as of December 31, 2011. These incentives offset approximately $85 million of operating expenses we incurred in 2011 related to our overall HIT implementation program. All states in which we operate that have CMS approval have become fully operational for providers to register for Year 1 Medicaid EHR incentive payments. The final Medicaid incentive payment amount to which a Provider is entitled is determined by several variables that are subject to validation by the state prior to such payment being issued, as well as post payment audits. The complexity of the changes required to our hospitals systems and the time required to complete the changes will likely result in some or all of our hospitals not being fully compliant in time to be eligible for the maximum HIT funding permitted under ARRA. Because of the uncertainties regarding the implementation of HIT, including CMS future EHR implementation regulations, the ability of our hospitals to achieve compliance and the associated costs, we cannot provide any assurances regarding the aforementioned estimates. FFY 2013 Budget Proposal The President released his FFY 2013 budget proposal on February 13, 2012. The key provisions of the budget proposal affecting Medicare and Medicaid include: A reduction in reimbursement from 70% of bad debts resulting from non payment of deductibles and co payments by Medicare beneficiaries to 25% over three years starting in 2013; A 10% reduction in IME payments beginning in 2014; A change to the Federal Matching Assistance Percentage formula in a manner that would result in a net reduction of federal money to the states; A phase down of the cap on state provider taxes, which could require some states to develop alternative sources of Medicaid funding or reduce provider payments; and A reduction in DSH allotments to states as the number of uninsured individuals declines following implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to the budget proposal or the impact the resulting legislation might have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 In addition to extending the CY 2011 rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, the Job Creation Act, among other things, will reduce Medicare bad debt reimbursement from 70% to 65% for cost reporting periods beginning in FFY 2013 and thereafter. We estimate this change will reduce our annual Medicare bad debt reimbursement by approximately $2 million beginning in 2013. Legislation to implement the remaining proposals must be enacted by Congress for them to become effective. We cannot predict what action Congress or the President might take with respect to such legislation or the impact the legislation might have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 43 Table of Contents Medicare and Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractor Initiatives Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 authorized a permanent program involving the use of third party recovery audit contractors (RACs) to identify Medicare overpayments and underpayments made to providers. RACs are compensated based on the amount of both overpayments and underpayments they identify by reviewing claims submitted to Medicare for correct coding and medical necessity. CMS must approve new issues prior to widespread review by the RACs. Historically, RACs have conducted claims reviews on a post payment basis. In February 2012, CMS announced that it is moving forward with a RAC prepayment demonstration in 11 states. We have established protocols to respond to RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we intend to pursue the reversal of adverse determinations where appropriate. In addition to overpayments that are not reversed on appeal, we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials. We expect that the RACs will continue to seek CMS approval to review additional issues. The Affordable Care Act expanded the RAC programs scope by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs by December 31, 2010 to audit payments to Medicaid providers. CMS issued a letter to state Medicaid directors on October 1, 2010 that (1) provided preliminary guidance to states on the implementation of Medicaid RAC programs, (2) created a deadline of December 31, 2010 for states to establish RAC programs, and (3) established a deadline of April 1, 2011 for states to fully implement their RAC programs. In September 2011, CMS issued a final rule requiring all states to implement a Medicaid RAC program effective January 1, 2012. We cannot predict with certainty the impact of the Medicare and Medicaid RAC program on our future results of operations or cash flows. MedPAC Recommendations The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent Congressional agency established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to advise Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. The MedPACs statutory mandate is quite broad; in addition to advising Congress on payments to private health plans participating in Medicare Advantage and providers in the Original Medicare Plan, MedPAC is also tasked with analyzing access to care, quality of care and other issues affecting Medicare. On January 12, 2012, the MedPAC commissioners voted on final recommendations for their 2012 Report to Congress. Among other things, MedPAC voted in favor of recommending: A 1% market basket payment update for Medicare hospital inpatient and outpatient services in 2013; and A reduction in payments, phased in over three years, for Medicare non emergency hospital outpatient evaluation and management examinations, to equalize them to payments for similar services provided in physician offices. MedPAC will submit its recommendations formally in a report to Congress, which is due no later than March 1, 2012. Medicare Value Based Purchasing Section 3001 of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a value based purchasing (VBP) program for hospital payments beginning in FFY 2013 based on hospital performance measures that are part of the hospital inpatient quality reporting program. The VBP program is intended to be budget neutral, with 1% of IPPS payments allocated to the program in FFY 2013 and increasing over time to 2% in FFY 2017 and beyond. On April 29, 2011, CMS issued the final rule establishing the hospital VBP program under the Medicare IPPS. Under the hospital VBP program, CMS will evaluate hospitals performance during the period July 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012 for the FFY 2013 hospital VBP payment determination. Hospitals will receive points on each measure based on the higher of their level of (1) achievement relative to an established standard based on all other hospitals baseline period performance, or (2) improvement in performance from their performance during a prior baseline period. The combined scores on all the measures will be translated into value based incentive payments for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012. CMS will notify each hospital of the estimated amount of its value based incentive payment for FFY 2013 at least 60 days prior to October 1, 2012 and will notify each hospital of the exact amount of its value based incentive payment on November 1, 2012. Although we believe that our Commitment to Quality initiatives will position our hospitals to benefit under the VBP program, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of the VBP program on our results of operations or cash flows. 44 Table of Contents Childrens Hospital Graduate Medical Education Payments We receive approximately $8 million in payments annually from the Childrens Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) program for resident training expenses at St. Christophers Hospital for Children. Legislative authority for payments to freestanding childrens hospitals for direct and indirect expenses attributable to medical residency programs under the federal Public Health Service Act expired on September 30, 2011. In December 2011, Congress passed a final omnibus appropriations bill that included funding in FFY 2012 for CHGME at levels similar to 2011; however, that funding will not be available for distribution to hospitals until Congress enacts legislation reauthorizing the CHGME program. We cannot provide any assurances that such legislation will be enacted in 2012. The Budget Control Act On August 2, 2011, the President signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) into law. The intent of the BCA is to reduce federal spending by at least $1.2 trillion over FFYs 2013 through 2021. The savings will be achieved by: Spending caps on certain discretionary spending, excluding payments to providers under Medicare and Medicaid; The creation of a bipartisan and bicameral Joint Select Committee of Congress charged with developing a legislative proposal to reduce the federal deficit by at least an additional $1.5 trillion by FFY 2021; and An automatic $1.2 trillion reduction (or enough to make up any shortfall between actual cuts enacted and $1.2 trillion), allocated 50% to defense and 50% to non defense discretionary spending, divided equally amongst FFYs 2013 through 2021 and enforced by sequestration that would begin during the first quarter of CY 2013 if legislation cutting $1.5 trillion was not enacted by January 15, 2012. The deadline for the Joint Select Committee (Committee) to issue a proposal was November 23, 2011. On November 21, 2011, the Committee announced that it could not agree on any spending reductions, thus triggering the aforementioned automatic sequestration. Under current law, Medicare payments to all providers will be reduced by 2% beginning in the first quarter of CY 2013. Federal Medicaid payments to states are excluded from sequestration, but budget pressures caused by cuts to other federal payments could result in some states imposing additional Medicaid reductions to balance their budgets. We cannot predict what other action Congress or the states might take to address federal spending or the impact those actions could have on our operations or cash flows. PRIVATE INSURANCE Managed Care We currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various HMOs and PPOs. HMOs generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician, hospital, pharmacy and ancillary service providers that HMO members must access through an assigned primary care physician. The members care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the HMOs quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner. HMOs typically provide reduced benefits or reimbursement (or none at all) to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care. PPOs generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers. PPO members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit, typically in the form of lower co payments, co insurance or deductibles. As employers and employees have demanded more choice, managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both HMO and PPO plans, including high deductible health care plans that may have limited benefits, but cost the employee less in premiums. The amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $5.2 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. Approximately 62% of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 was derived from our top ten managed care payers. National payers generate approximately 44% of our total net managed care revenues. The remainder comes from regional or local payers. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 approximately 55% and 57%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers. 45 Table of Contents Revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers. The payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis. At the end of each month, on an individual hospital basis, we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans. Based on reserves as of December 31, 2011, a 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would impact the estimated reserves by approximately $9 million. Some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include: (1) changes in reimbursement levels for procedures, supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered; (2) changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached; (3) changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing; (4) final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels; (5) secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments; and (6) reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels. Contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms, as well as payment history. Although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill, we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. We do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues. In addition, on a corporate wide basis, we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans. We expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term. However, the managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans, which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend. Although we have had 26 consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing, we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in future years. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care and other payers imposed by the Affordable Care Act will have on our commercial managed care volumes and payment rates. In the year ended December 31, 2011, our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately 79% higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers, including managed Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans. Indemnity An indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient, subject to policy conditions and exclusions. Unlike an HMO member, a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers. SELF PAY PATIENTS Self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments, such as Medicare and Medicaid, do not have some form of private insurance and, therefore, are responsible for their own medical bills. A significant portion of our self pay patients is admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment that is more costly to provide and, therefore, results in higher billings, which are the least collectible of all accounts. We believe that our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors, including increased unemployment rates, reductions in state Medicaid budgets, increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance, and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers. Self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems. At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 7% of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients. Further, a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients, as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. We provide revenue cycle management and patient communications services through our Conifer subsidiary, which has performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on the drivers of bad debt for each hospital. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts, as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance, that we deem highly collectible. We are dedicated to modifying and 46 Table of Contents refining our processes as needed, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. Over the longer term, several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge. For example, our Compact with Uninsured Patients (Compact) is designed to offer managed care style discounts to certain uninsured patients, which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges. A significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts. Under the Compact, the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance, which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded. The uninsured patient accounts, net of contractual allowances recorded, are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process. In July 2010, the President signed the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 (the Dodd Frank Act) into law. Under the Dodd Frank Act, a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was formed within the U.S. Federal Reserve to promulgate regulations to promote transparency, simplicity, fairness, accountability and equal access in the market for consumer financial products or services, including debt collection services. The legislation gives significant discretion to the CFPB in establishing regulatory requirements and enforcement priorities. At this time, we cannot predict the extent to which the operations of our Conifer subsidiary could be affected by these developments. Our estimated costs (based on selected operating expenses, which include salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses) of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $406 million, $377 million and $365 million, respectively. We also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. Most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received, subject to a cap. Except for the per diem amounts, our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care; therefore, we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues. Most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospitals eligibility for Medicaid DSH payments. Revenues attributable to DSH payments and other state funded subsidy payments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $260 million, $181 million and $171 million, respectively. These payments are intended to mitigate our cost of uncompensated care, as well as reduced Medicaid funding levels. Our estimated costs (based on the selected operating expenses described above) of caring for charity care patients for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $125 million, $120 million and $118 million, respectively. Our method of measuring the estimated costs uses adjusted self pay/charity patient days multiplied by selected operating expenses per adjusted patient day. The adjusted self pay/charity patient days represents actual self pay/charity patient days adjusted to include self pay/charity outpatient services by multiplying actual self pay/charity patient days by the sum of gross self pay/charity inpatient revenues and gross self pay/charity outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross self pay/charity inpatient revenues. The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. However, because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the expected increase in revenues and expected decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals, and numerous other provisions in the law that may affect us. In addition, even after implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we may continue to experience a high level of bad debt expense and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care program. 47 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 9,273 $ 8,966 $ 307 Other operations 311 239 72 Net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts 9,584 9,205 379 Less provision for doubtful accounts 730 738 (8 ) Net operating revenues 8,854 8,467 387 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 4,082 3,900 182 Supplies 1,582 1,577 5 Other operating expenses, net 2,100 1,940 160 Electronic health record incentives (55 ) (55 ) Depreciation and amortization 413 394 19 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 27 10 17 Litigation and investigation costs 55 12 43 Operating income $ 650 $ 634 $ 16 Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 46.1 % 46.1 % % Supplies 17.9 % 18.6 % (0.7 )% Other operating expenses, net 23.7 % 22.9 % 0.8 % Electronic health record incentives (0.6 )% % (0.6 )% Depreciation and amortization 4.7 % 4.7 % % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 0.3 % 0.1 % 0.2 % Litigation and investigation costs 0.6 % 0.1 % 0.5 % Operating income 7.3 % 7.5 % (0.2 )% Net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues, as well as nonpatient revenues (rental income, management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias, gift shops and parking) and other miscellaneous revenue. Net operating revenues of other operations primarily consist of revenues from (1) physician practices, (2) a long term acute care hospital and (3) revenue cycle services provided by our Conifer subsidiary. Revenues from our general hospitals represented approximately 97% of our total net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts in both 2011 and 2010. None of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, and only one of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% (approximately 5.8%) of our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2011. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $311 million and $239 million in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in net operating revenues from other operations during 2011 primarily relates to our additional owned physician practices and revenue cycle services provided by our Conifer subsidiary. Equity earnings for unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $8 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 48 Table of Contents The tables below show certain selected historical operating statistics of our continuing hospitals: Years Ended December 31, Admissions, Patient Days and Surgeries 2011 2010 Increase (Decrease) Total admissions 515,693 512,972 0.5 % Paying admissions (excludes charity and uninsured) 480,909 478,739 0.5 % Charity and uninsured admissions 34,784 34,233 1.6 % Admissions through emergency department 310,286 300,652 3.2 % Paying admissions as a percentage of total admissions 93.3 % 93.3 % %(1) Charity and uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions 6.7 % 6.7 % %(1) Emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions 60.2 % 58.6 % 1.6 %(1) Surgeries inpatient 147,725 150,562 (1.9 )% Surgeries outpatient 219,913 209,644 4.9 % Total surgeries 367,638 360,206 2.1 % Patient days total 2,452,156 2,473,017 (0.8 )% Adjusted patient days(2) 3,732,330 3,723,702 0.2 % Average length of stay (days) 4.8 4.8 (1) Adjusted patient admissions(2) 791,919 778,505 1.7 % Number of hospitals (at end of period) (3) 50 50 (1) Licensed beds (at end of period) 13,453 13,428 0.2 % Average licensed beds 13,449 13,430 0.1 % Utilization of licensed beds(4) 50.0 % 50.4 % (0.4 )%(1) (1) The change is the difference between the 2011 and 2010 amounts shown.

(2) Adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues. REVENUES During the year ended December 31, 2011, net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts from continuing operations increased 4.1%, which included a 3.6% increase in net patient revenues, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Increases in pricing were the largest contributing factors, resulting in a 3.4% increase in net patient revenues, while increases in our inpatient admissions and outpatient visits resulted in a 0.2% increase in net patient revenues. Our net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 3.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Several factors impacted our net inpatient revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, including: Medicaid DSH payments and other state funded subsidy revenues of $260 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $181 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 (significant changes in DSH revenues include: (i) $91 million of additional revenues, net of provider fees and other expenses, related to the California supplemental Medi Cal payments programs, which were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 because CMS issued the final required federal approval of the programs in 2011; (ii) a $33 million increase in the year ended December 31, 2011 related to our Pennsylvania hospitals, primarily due to the Pennsylvania provider fee program that was approved by CMS in 2011; and (iii) a $22 million reduction in the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to a new regulation issued by the State of Missouri); 50 Table of Contents Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts; Increased Medicaid related admissions, the reimbursement for which is lower than other payers; A $4 million unfavorable patient revenue adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the portion of our bad debts that will not be reimbursed by Medicare compared to $11 million in unfavorable adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2010; An unfavorable patient revenue adjustment of approximately $20 million ($14 million related to 2009 and prior years and $6 million related to the year ended December 31, 2010) recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010 for the estimated impact on our DSH payments as a result of estimated lower SSI percentages at certain of our hospitals; and The recognition by our Philadelphia hospitals of $8 million of revenues that were approved for distribution to us in the year ended December 31, 2011 by a Philadelphia HMO in which we hold a minority interest. Patient days decreased by 0.8%, while total admissions increased by 0.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. We believe the following factors contributed to the changes in our inpatient volume levels: (1) the current weak economic conditions, which we believe have adversely impacted the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals; (2) loss of patients to competing health care providers; (3) industry trends reflecting the shift of certain clinical procedures being performed in an outpatient setting rather than in an inpatient setting; and (4) strategic reduction of services related to our Targeted Growth Initiative, which seeks to de emphasize or eliminate less profitable service lines. Net outpatient revenues and total outpatient visits increased 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The growth in our outpatient revenues and volumes was substantially related to the acquisition of various outpatient centers during 2010 and 2011. Outpatient revenue per visit declined 0.3% primarily due to the provision of lower acuity services by outpatient centers we acquired in 2010 and 2011, as well as an unfavorable shift in our total outpatient payer mix, including a decline in managed care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. Net operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011 included $59 million related to the revenue cycle services provided by our Conifer subsidiary compared to $31 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts was 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Key factors contributing to the change in the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 include (i) a $21 million decrease in revenues from the uninsured in the 2011 period compared to the same period in 2010, (ii) a $12 million favorable adjustment in the 2011 period for Medicare bad debts to be claimed on our cost reports compared to $37 million in the 2010 period, and (iii) a lower collection rate on self pay accounts in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period. Our self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 27.8% as of December 31, 2011 from 28.3% as of December 31, 2010. 51 Table of Contents The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at December 31, 2011 and 2010: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Accounts Receivable Before Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Net Accounts Receivable Before Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Net Medicare $ 170 $ $ 170 $ 159 $ $ 159 Medicaid 123 123 118 118 Net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (38 ) (38 ) (26 ) (26 ) Managed care 777 69 708 714 60 654 Self pay uninsured 219 193 26 194 172 22 Self pay balance after insurance 136 78 58 119 66 53 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agency subsidiary 64 64 33 33 Other payers 220 51 169 168 39 129 Total continuing operations 1,671 391 1,280 1,479 337 1,142 Total discontinued operations 4 6 (2 ) 16 15 1 $ 1,675 $ 397 $ 1,278 $ 1,495 $ 352 $ 1,143 We provide revenue cycle management and patient communications services through our Conifer subsidiary, which has performed systematic analyses to focus attention on the drivers of bad debt for each of our hospitals. While emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate, this is not the case at all hospitals. As a result, we have increased our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well. These initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts, as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance, that we deem highly collectible. We are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed, enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable. A significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients, as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. Collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus, particularly over the past several years, as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix. At December 31, 2011, our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 27.8%, including collections from point of service through collections by our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. We have experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows: 29.9% at March 31, 2010; 29.5% at June 30, 2010; 29.1% at September 30, 2010; 28.3% at December 31, 2010; 27.9% at March 31, 2011; 27.9% at June 30, 2011; and 27.7% at September 30, 2011. These self pay collection rates include payments made by patients, including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance, prior to an account being classified and assigned to our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. Based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease or increase in our self pay collection rate, or approximately 3%, which we believe could be a reasonable likely change, would result in an unfavorable or favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $6 million. Payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts. We typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes; however, we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services. Our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately 98.2% and 98.4% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which includes collections from point of service through collections by our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. We experienced a temporary slowdown in collections related to commercial and governmental managed care accounts receivable in the year ended December 31, 2011 as a result of a revenue cycle operational realignment we initiated that resulted in the closure of two of our service centers, which we anticipate will create long term operating efficiencies. We continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow. In 2011, we completed the transition of the patient access staff and operations of the majority of our hospitals to Conifer. This initiative is focused on standardizing and improving patient access processes, including pre registration, registration, verification of eligibility and benefits, liability identification and collection, and financial counseling, while more clearly aligning responsibility for revenue cycle activities 52 Table of Contents with Conifer. The goals of the effort are focused on reducing denials, improving service levels to patients and increasing the quality of accounts that end up in accounts receivable. Although we continue to focus on improving our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable. We manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as (1) total cash collections, (2) point of service cash collections, (3) accounts receivable days outstanding (AR Days), and (4) accounts receivable by aging category. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from continuing operations of $1.318 billion and $1.168 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $38 million and $26 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively: December 31, 2011 Medicare Medicaid Managed Care Indemnity, Self Pay and Other Total 0 60 days 93 % 64 % 75 % 31 % 68 % 61 120 days 3 % 17 % 12 % 17 % 12 % 121 180 days 2 % 9 % 5 % 10 % 6 % Over 180 days 2 % 10 % 8 % 42 % 14 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % December 31, 2010 Medicare Medicaid Managed Care Indemnity, Self Pay and Other Total 0 60 days 96 % 70 % 79 % 40 % 74 % 61 120 days 3 % 22 % 12 % 20 % 13 % 121 180 days 1 % 8 % 4 % 10 % 5 % Over 180 days % % 5 % 30 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 53 days at December 31, 2011 and 50 days at December 31, 2010, which were within our target, as adjusted to reflect the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011 07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954): Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities, of less than 55 days. AR Days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our net operating revenues from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter. As of December 31, 2011, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $3.7 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts assigned to our Conifer collection agency subsidiary is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. Patient advocates from our Medical Eligibility Program (MEP) screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs. They also expedite the process of applying for these government programs. Receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for Medicaid are classified as Medicaid pending, under our MEP, with appropriate contractual allowances recorded. Based on recent trends, approximately 92% of all accounts in our MEP are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as Medicaid. 53 Table of Contents The following table shows the approximate amount of accounts receivable in our MEP, still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2011 and 2010, by aging category: December 31, 2011 2010 0 60 days $ 81 $ 100 61 120 days 18 21 121 180 days 7 8 Over 180 days 17 13 Total $ 123 $ 142 SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was flat for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased 4.5% in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. This increase is primarily due to annual merit increases for our employees, as well as an increase in the number of physicians we employ, increased overtime costs, increased health benefits costs, increased 401(k) plan expense and increased employee related costs associated with our HIT implementation program, partially offset by reductions in workers compensation expense and annual incentive compensation expense, in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Included in salaries, wages and benefits expense in 2011 is $4 million of expense due to a 136 basis point decrease in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future workers compensation liabilities. Salaries, wages and benefits expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 also included stock based compensation expense of $24 million and $22 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 25% of our employees were represented by various labor unions. These employees primarily registered nurses and service and maintenance workers were located at 22 of our hospitals, the majority of which are in California and Florida. We are in the process of renegotiating the collective bargaining agreements for all of the facilities whose contracts have expired and negotiating new contracts where employees have chosen union representation in 2011. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations, but increases in salaries, wages and benefits could result from these agreements. Furthermore, there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 18.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Supplies expense per adjusted patient day was flat in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Supplies expense was unfavorably impacted by the higher cost of pharmaceuticals and increased costs of surgical supplies, partially offset by decreases in cardiology related costs due to renegotiated prices and lower volume levels. In general, supplies expense changes are primarily attributable to changes in our patient volume levels and the mix of procedures performed. We strive to control supplies expense through product standardization, contract compliance, improved utilization, bulk purchases and operational improvements. The items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers, orthopedics and implants, and high cost pharmaceuticals. We also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of MedAssets, Inc., a company that offers group purchasing procurement strategy, outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, NET Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues was 23.7% in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 22.9% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by 7.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. This change is due in part to a $53 million increase in malpractice expense in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in malpractice expense is primarily attributable to several large unfavorable case reserve adjustments in the 2011 period as compared to the prior year period, as well as a $17 million unfavorable impact of a 136 basis point decrease in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities in the year ended 54 Table of Contents December 31, 2011. The amount of malpractice expense in the year ended December 31, 2011 may not necessarily be indicative of malpractice expense amounts in future years due to changes in loss experience and interest rates used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities. There were also increases in other operating expenses due to: increased physician and medical fees ($29 million); increased costs of contracted services ($25 million); increased systems implementation costs and information technology service contract expenses primarily related to our HIT implementation program ($16 million); increased rent and lease expense ($10 million); increased physician relocation and income guarantee costs ($9 million); a favorable adjustment of $6 million in the 2011 period compared to $10 million in the 2010 period related to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents; increased hospital provider fees assessed by certain states in which we operate ($4 million, which were substantially offset by additional DSH payments recognized in net patient revenues); increased repairs and maintenance expense ($14 million); and a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations ($3 million). These increases were partially offset by $7 million of lower consulting costs and gains of $8 million from the sales of the building at the former campus of one of our hospitals and a medical office building. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $27 million. This amount included a $6 million impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital, consistent with our previous estimates in prior years when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. Unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets, this hospital is at risk of future impairments, particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate or equipment continues to decline. The aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was $20 million as of December 31, 2011 after recording the impairment charge. In addition, we recorded a $6 million charge in 2011for the write off of goodwill associated with our diagnostic imaging center business in Louisiana. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future operating results of the centers, primarily due to our limited market presence, indicated that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value. As a result, we reduced the carrying value of the goodwill to its fair value determined based on an appraisal. In 2011, we also recorded impairment charges of $1 million in connection with the sale of seven medical office buildings in Texas, $1 million related to a cost basis investment, $7 million in employee severance costs, $3 million in lease termination costs, $1 million of acceleration of stock based compensation costs and $2 million of other related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $10 million. This amount included a $5 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment. Material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time, consistent with our previous estimates in prior years when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believed the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the 55 Table of Contents estimate of the fair value of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. We disclosed in our Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010 that, unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improved to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long lived assets, this hospital was at risk of future impairments, which impairments occurred in 2011 as described above, particularly if we spent significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate or equipment continued to decline. The aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was $25 million as of December 31, 2010 after recording the impairment charge. In addition, we recorded a $5 million net impairment charge in connection with the sale of nine medical office buildings in Florida and $2 million in employee severance and other related costs. These charges were partially offset by a $2 million credit related to the collection of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals, which had been fully reserved in a prior year. Our impairment tests presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results in our hospitals, which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospitals most recent projections. If these projections are not met, or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook, further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur, and we may incur additional restructuring charges. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $55 million compared to $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The 2011 amount is comprised of costs associated with our evaluation of an unsolicited acquisition proposal received in November 2010 (which was subsequently withdrawn), changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, accruals for a physician privileges case and certain hospital related tort claims, the settlement of a union arbitration claim, and costs to defend the Company in various matters. The 2010 costs primarily relate to changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and costs to defend the Company in various matters. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $375 million compared to $424 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest expense primarily relates to our repurchases of outstanding senior notes during 2010 and the $30 million favorable impact from the interest rate swap agreement we terminated in August 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the interest rate swap agreement generated approximately $8 million of cash interest savings and a $22 million gain on the settlement of the agreement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about this agreement. LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $117 million, primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the $713 million aggregate principal amount of 9% senior secured notes due 2015 that we purchased during the period, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $57 million primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the $782 million aggregate principal amount of 73/8% senior notes due 2013 that we purchased during the period, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes. In addition, we repurchased $40 million aggregate principal amount of our 97/8% senior notes due 2014 and $7 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for total cash of $49 million. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded income tax expense of $61 million compared to a $977 million benefit during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in income tax expense in the 2011 period is primarily due to the elimination of substantially all of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the three months ended September 30, 2010. We now recognize income tax expense that includes little or no change in the deferred tax valuation allowance, whereas in the 2010 period the tax impact associated with our earnings was substantially offset by the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about these amounts. 56 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL NON GAAP DISCLOSURES The financial information provided throughout this report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, we use certain non GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating agencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements, some of which are recurring or involve cash payments. In addition, from time to time we use these measures to define certain performance targets under our compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA is a non GAAP measure that we use in our analysis of the performance of our business, which we define as net income (loss) attributable to our common shareholders before: (1) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax; (2) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (3) preferred stock dividends; (4) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (5) income tax benefit (expense); (6) investment earnings (loss); (7) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt; (8) net gain (loss) on sales of investments; (9) interest expense; (10) litigation and investigation benefit (costs), net of insurance recoveries; (11) hurricane insurance recoveries, net of costs; (12) impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges, net of insurance recoveries; and (13) depreciation and amortization. As is the case with all non GAAP measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with this metric, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another, and should recognize that Adjusted EBITDA does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance because it excludes many items that are included in our financial statements. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance. The table below shows the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to our common shareholders (the most comparable GAAP term) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Net income attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders $ 58 $ 1,119 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (12 ) (9 ) Preferred stock dividends (24 ) (24 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (6 ) 17 Income from continuing operations 100 1,135 Income tax benefit (expense) (61 ) 977 Investment earnings 3 5 Loss from early extinguishment of debt (117 ) (57 ) Interest expense (375 ) (424 ) Operating income 650 634 Litigation and investigation costs (55 ) (12 ) Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges (27 ) (10 ) Depreciation and amortization (413 ) (394 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,145 $ 1,050 Net operating revenues $ 8,854 $ 8,467 Adjusted EBITDA as % of net operating revenues (Adjusted EBITDA margin) 12.9 % 12.4 % 57 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 The following two tables summarize our net operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations, both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Net operating revenues: General hospitals $ 8,966 $ 8,808 $ 158 Other operations 239 206 33 Net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts 9,205 9,014 191 Less provision for doubtful accounts 738 696 42 Net operating revenues 8,467 8,318 149 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 3,900 3,857 43 Supplies 1,577 1,569 8 Other operating expenses, net 1,940 1,910 30 Depreciation and amortization 394 386 8 Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 10 27 (17 ) Litigation and investigation costs 12 31 (19 ) Operating income $ 634 $ 538 $ 96 Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Net operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % % Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 46.1 % 46.4 % (0.3 )% Supplies 18.6 % 18.9 % (0.3 )% Other operating expenses, net 22.9 % 22.9 % % Depreciation and amortization 4.7 % 4.6 % 0.1 % Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, and restructuring charges 0.1 % 0.3 % (0.2 )% Litigation and investigation costs 0.1 % 0.4 % (0.3 )% Operating income 7.5 % 6.5 % 1.0 % Revenues from our general hospitals represented approximately 97% of our total net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts in both 2010 and 2009. None of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, and only one of our individual hospitals represented more than 5% (approximately 5.4%) our total assets, excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables, at December 31, 2010. Net operating revenues from our other operations were $239 million and $206 million in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in net operating revenues from other operations during 2010 primarily relates to our additional owned physician practices and revenue cycle services provided by our Conifer subsidiary. Equity earnings for unconsolidated affiliates, included in our net operating revenues from other operations, were $5 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

REVENUES During the year ended December 31, 2010, net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts from continuing operations increased 2.1%, which included a 1.8% increase in net patient revenues, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Increases in pricing, including the provision of higher acuity services and a favorable shift in managed care payer mix, were the largest contributing factors, resulting in a 3.6% increase in net patient revenues, while declines in our inpatient admissions and outpatient visits resulted in a 1.8% decrease in net patient revenues. Our net inpatient revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 0.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. There were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues. Key positive factors include: Improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts; and The provision of higher acuity services, including a 2.5% increase in acuity for commercial managed care inpatients. Key negative factors include: An unfavorable shift in our total payer mix, including a decline in commercial managed care admissions; An $11 million unfavorable patient revenue adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the portion of our bad debts that will not be reimbursed by Medicare; and An unfavorable patient revenue adjustment of approximately $20 million ($14 million related to prior years and $6 million related to the year ended December 31, 2010) recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2010 for the estimated impact on our DSH payments as a result of estimated lower SSI percentages at certain of our hospitals compared to $23 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. 60 Table of Contents Patient days and total admissions decreased during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 by 3.1% and 2.4%, respectively. Our patient volumes in the year ended December 31, 2010 were partially adversely impacted by a decline in flu related volumes, as well as weather related disruptions. We believe the following factors also contributed to the overall decline in our inpatient volume levels: (1) loss of patients to competing health care providers; (2) strategic reduction of services related to our Targeted Growth Initiative, which seeks to de emphasize or eliminate less profitable service lines; and (3) weak economic conditions, which we believe adversely impacted the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals. Net outpatient revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 4.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, despite a 0.4% decline in total outpatient visits. The primary reasons for the increase in outpatient revenues were improved terms of our managed care contracts and the provision of higher acuity services. Outpatient revenues were also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of various outpatient centers during 2010. The growth in outpatient revenue per visit of 5.3% was constrained by an unfavorable shift in our total outpatient payer mix, including a decline in managed care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts was 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts is primarily due to a 180 basis point decline in our collection rate on self pay accounts, a $19 million increase in uninsured revenues and higher pricing. These items were partially offset by $37 million of favorable adjustments for Medicare bad debts that we claimed on our Medicare cost reports and improved managed care accounts receivable balances by aging category. Our self pay collection rate, which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable, declined to approximately 28.3% as of December 31, 2010 from 30.1% as of December 31, 2009. The table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at December 31, 2010 and 2009: December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Accounts Receivable Before Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Net Accounts Receivable Before Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Net Medicare $ 159 $ $ 159 $ 162 $ $ 162 Medicaid 118 118 106 106 Net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances (26 ) (26 ) (24 ) (24 ) Managed care 714 60 654 712 62 650 Self pay uninsured 194 172 22 204 175 29 Self pay balance after insurance 119 66 53 118 62 56 Estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to our collection agency subsidiary 33 33 35 35 Other payers 168 39 129 164 42 122 Total continuing operations 1,479 337 1,142 1,477 341 1,136 Total discontinued operations 16 15 1 50 28 22 $ 1,495 $ 352 $ 1,143 $ 1,527 $ 369 $ 1,158 At December 31, 2010, our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 28.3%, including collections from point of service through collections by our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. During 2009 and 2010, we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows: 31.4% at March 31, 2009; 30.8% at June 30, 2009; 30.3% at September 30, 2009; 30.1% at December 31, 2009; 29.9% at March 31, 2010; 29.5% at June 30, 2010; and 29.1% at September 30, 2010. These self pay collection rates include payments made by patients, including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance, prior to an account being classified and assigned to our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. Based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at December 31, 2010, a 10% decrease or increase in our self pay collection rate, or approximately 3%, which we believe could 61 Table of Contents be a reasonable likely change, would result in an unfavorable or favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $5 million. Our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately 98.4% at December 31, 2010 and 98.0% at December 31, 2009, which includes collections from point of service through collections by our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. The following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from continuing operations of $1.168 billion and $1.160 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of $26 million and $24 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively: December 31, 2010 Medicare Medicaid Managed Care Indemnity, Self Pay and Other Total 0 60 days 96 % 70 % 79 % 40 % 74 % 61 120 days 3 % 22 % 12 % 20 % 13 % 121 180 days 1 % 8 % 4 % 10 % 5 % Over 180 days % % 5 % 30 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % December 31, 2009 Medicare Medicaid Managed Care Indemnity, Self Pay and Other Total 0 60 days 94 % 63 % 78 % 38 % 72 % 61 120 days 3 % 24 % 12 % 19 % 13 % 121 180 days 3 % 11 % 5 % 10 % 6 % Over 180 days % 2 % 5 % 33 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Our AR Days from continuing operations were 50 days at both December 31, 2010 and 2009, which were within our target, as adjusted to reflect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2011 07, of less than 55 days. AR Days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenues from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter. As of December 31, 2010, we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately $4.3 billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. These accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts; however, an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts assigned to our Conifer collection agency subsidiary is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable. The following table shows the approximate amount of accounts receivable in our MEP, still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at December 31, 2010 and 2009, by aging category: December 31, 2010 2009 0 60 days $ 100 $ 66 61 120 days 21 18 121 180 days 8 5 Over 180 days 13 10 Total $ 142 $ 99 SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Salaries, wages and benefits per adjusted patient day 62 Table of Contents increased approximately 2.7% in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. This increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees, the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage, increased health benefits costs, an increase in the number of employed physicians, increased severance costs and higher state unemployment taxes, partially offset by decreased accruals for annual incentive compensation, reduced contract labor expense and discretionary contribution expense of $16 million in the 2009 period for contributions to the 401(k) plan accounts of employees who were not eligible for annual incentive compensation, in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Contract labor expense, which is included in salaries, wages and benefits, was $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $12 million, or 15%, as compared to the same period in 2009. Salaries, wages and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $22 million and $23 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. SUPPLIES Supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was 18.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 18.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009; supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by 2.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Supplies expense was unfavorably impacted by the increased utilization of high cost implants and pharmaceuticals, partially offset by decreases in the cost of pacemakers due to renegotiated prices and lower volume levels. A portion of the increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, NET Other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues was 22.9% in both years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by approximately 3.4% in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. There were increases in other operating expenses primarily due to: the effect of lower volumes on operating leverage; increases in the costs of repairs, maintenance and technology service contracts ($17 million); a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations ($15 million); increased costs of contracted services ($11 million); increased physician relocation costs ($10 million); increased systems implementation costs ($3 million); and increased hospital provider fees assessed by the states in which we operate ($17 million), which were substantially offset by additional Medicaid supplemental payments recognized in revenues. Also partially offsetting these increases was a $32 million, or 36%, decline in malpractice expense to $57 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $89 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The decline in malpractice expense is principally due to a 6% decrease in the average cost per claim and a 3% decrease in the number of expected claims. There was minimal impact to expense from a two basis point increase in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities, compared to $9 million of similar expense in the year ended December 31, 2009. The amount of malpractice expense in the year ended December 31, 2010 may not necessarily be indicative of malpractice expense amounts in future years due to changes in loss experience and interest rates used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities. Declines in rent expense ($7 million) and a favorable adjustment of $10 million related to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents, which was recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2010, also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $10 million. This amount included a $5 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment. Material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time, consistent with our previous estimates in prior years when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believed the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the 63 Table of Contents hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. We disclosed in our Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010 that unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improved to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long lived assets, this hospital was at risk of future impairments, which impairments occurred in 2011 as described above, particularly if we spent significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate or equipment continued to decline. The aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was $25 million as of December 31, 2010 after recording the impairment charge. In addition, we recorded a $5 million net impairment charge in connection with the sale of nine medical office buildings in Florida and $2 million in employee severance and other related costs. These charges were partially offset by a $2 million credit related to the collection of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals, which had been fully reserved in a prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $27 million. This amount included a $7 million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings, equipment and other long lived assets, primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets, of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values, primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates. Material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time, consistent with our previous estimates during 2008 when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believed the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. We also recorded a $10 million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the campus of one hospital that moved to a new, replacement campus during 2010. Our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the former campus for several months during 2010 and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings of the campus. We compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and, because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. The remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 include $4 million of employee severance and other related costs, a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals as a result of the buyer filing for bankruptcy, and a $3 million impairment charge for the write down of other assets primarily related to an option to purchase certain real property near one of our hospitals that no longer had value due to the financial condition of the owner of the real property. LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATION COSTS Litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $12 million compared to $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2010 costs primarily relate to costs to defend the Company in various matters and changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in Note 15 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as costs associated with the unsolicited acquisition proposal we received in November 2010. The 2009 costs primarily relate to reserves established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in Note 15 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2009 costs also include amounts paid to indemnify a former officer of the Company in a matter to which the Company was not a party and costs to defend the Company in various matters. INTEREST EXPENSE During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded interest expense of $424 million compared to $445 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in interest expense primarily relates to our repurchases of outstanding senior notes during 2009 and 2010. GAIN (LOSS) FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $57 million, primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the $782 million aggregate principal amount of 73/8% senior notes due 2013 that we purchased during the period, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes. In addition, we 64 Table of Contents repurchased $40 million aggregate principal amount of our 97/8% senior notes due 2014 and $7 million aggregate principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 for total cash of $49 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $97 million, primarily related to the estimated fair values of new notes issued in note exchanges at less than their par values, net of the write off of unamortized note discounts, issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes tendered, as well as other notes repurchased. See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details about our debt transactions. INVESTMENT EARNINGS During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded investment earnings of $5 million compared to no investment earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009. In 2009, investment earnings were offset by a $7 million loss related to an agreement reached during June 2009 for the early redemption of our $56 million investment in hospital authority bonds related to previously divested hospitals in the Dallas, Texas area for $49 million of cash that we received in June 2009. NET GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a gain on sale of investments of approximately $15 million in continuing operations related to the sale of our 50% membership interest in Peoples Health Network, the company that administered the operations of Tenet Choices, Inc., our wholly owned Medicare Advantage HMO insurance subsidiary in Louisiana. INCOME TAX BENEFIT During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an income tax benefit of $977 million compared to $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The benefit recorded in the 2010 period is primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets. The net decrease in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to the estimated realization of deferred tax assets resulting from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against projected future years taxable income. During the year ended December 31, 2010, after considering all available evidence, both positive and negative, we concluded that the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets could be reduced by approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about the 2010 tax benefit. 65 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH REQUIREMENTS Our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees, are summarized in the table below, all as of December 31, 2011: Years Ending December 31, Later Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Years (In Millions) Long term debt(1) $ 7,108 $ 409 $ 561 $ 397 $ 784 $ 287 $ 4,670 Borrowings under credit facility(1) 90 2 2 2 2 82 Capital lease obligations(1) 25 8 9 6 2 Long term non cancelable operating leases 416 109 99 59 40 30 79 Standby letters of credit 164 162 2 Guarantees(2) 155 83 32 17 13 10 Asset retirement obligations 147 147 Academic affiliation agreements(3) 217 31 22 22 19 19 104 Tax liabilities 33 8 25 Supplemental executive retirement plan obligations 530 20 20 20 20 20 430 Information technology contract services 1,700 197 193 173 166 168 803 Purchase orders 231 231 Total(4) $ 10,816 $ 1,260 $ 940 $ 696 $ 1,044 $ 616 $ 6,260 (1) Includes interest through maturity date/lease termination. (2) Includes minimum revenue guarantees, primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals, and operating lease guarantees. (3) These agreements contain various rights and termination provisions. (4) Professional liability and workers compensation reserves have been excluded from the table. At December 31, 2011, the current and long term professional and general liability reserves included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were approximately $75 million and $337 million, respectively, and the current and long term workers compensation reserves included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were approximately $41 million and $106 million, respectively. Standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs. The amount of collateral required is primarily dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness. The insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers. The standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility, as amended November 29, 2011. We consummated the following transactions affecting our long term commitments in the year ended December 31, 2011: We entered into a five year extension of our existing outsourcing contract for information technology services through 2021, as well as commitments for future professional services under the same contract to be provided to us related to our initiative to achieve full compliance with the ARRA HIT requirements. Our increased cash obligations under this contract approximate $1 billion. We entered into three contractual agreements for an aggregate commitment of $41 million for future professional services to be provided to us and licensed software fees related to our ARRA HIT initiative. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid approximately $13 million of this aggregate committment. We entered into non cancellable capital leases of approximately $23 million, primarily for equipment. In November 2011, we purchased approximately $713 million aggregate principal amount of our 9% senior secured notes due 2015 for total cash of approximately $776 million. We purchased the senior secured notes with the net proceeds from our sale of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 61/4% senior secured notes due 2018. As part of our long term objective to manage our capital structure, we may from time to time seek to retire, purchase, redeem or refinance some of our outstanding debt or equity securities subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity 66 Table of Contents requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. These actions are part of our strategy to manage our leverage and capital structure over time, which is dependent on our total amount of debt, our cash and our operating results. At December 31, 2011, using the last 12 months of Adjusted EBITDA, our ratio of total long term debt, net of cash and cash equivalent balances, to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.7x. We anticipate this ratio will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on earnings performance and other factors. We intend to manage this ratio by following our business plan, managing our cost structure and through other changes in our capital structure, including, if appropriate, the issuance of equity or convertible securities. Our ability to achieve our leverage and capital structure objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in the Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in Part I of this report. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities (including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations), equipment and information systems additions and replacements (including those required to achieve compliance with the HIT requirements under ARRA), introduction of new medical technologies, design and construction of new buildings, and various other capital improvements. Capital expenditures were $475 million, $476 million and $456 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which included $13 million and $1 million in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to discontinued operations. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the year ending December 31, 2012 will total approximately $500 million to $550 million, including $109 million that was accrued as a liability at December 31, 2011. Our budgeted 2012 capital expenditures include approximately $27 million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities pursuant to the terms of a negotiated consent decree. We expect to spend approximately $61 million more on such improvements over the next four years. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we acquired 15 outpatient centers four diagnostic imaging centers, a majority interest in one other diagnostic imaging center, three oncology centers, an urgent care center, a majority interest in five ambulatory surgery centers, and a majority interest in one other ambulatory surgery center in which we previously held a minority interest. In 2011, we also acquired 26 physician practice entities. All of these acquisitions were in furtherance of our efforts to expand our outpatient services and increase our outpatient revenues. The aggregate purchase price of the acquisitions was $84 million, which we funded with cash on hand. Interest payments, net of capitalized interest, were $347 million, $402 million and $439 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest payments were higher in the 2009 period as compared to the 2010 and 2011 periods primarily due to $23 million of interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of our exchange of approximately $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our 63/8% senior notes due 2011 and our 61/2% senior notes due 2012 for new senior secured notes, as well as other subsequent debt repurchases that reduced our outstanding debt and debt refinancings at lower interest rates. From time to time, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates. We were party to an interest rate swap agreement for an aggregate notional amount of $600 million from February 14, 2011 through August 2, 2011. The interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was being used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates. It had the effect of converting our 10% senior secured notes due 2018 from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid semi annually based on the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a floating rate spread of 6.60%. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the 10% senior secured notes, which we expected to substantially offset each other, were recorded in interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our interest rate swap agreement generated approximately $8 million of cash interest savings and a $22 million gain on the settlement of the agreement. In the year ended December 31, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion. That interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates. It had the effect of converting our 73/8% senior notes due 2013 from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid monthly based on the one month LIBOR plus a floating rate spread of approximately 5.46%. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the 73/8% senior notes, which substantially offset each other, were recorded in interest expense. To mitigate risks related to potential significant increases in the one month LIBOR, we also entered into a separate agreement that limited the maximum one month LIBOR to 8% under the interest rate swap agreement. We realized approximately $8 million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement, which we entered into in May 2009 and terminated in November 2009. Income tax payments, net of tax refunds, were approximately $10 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to income tax refunds, net of tax payments, of approximately $34 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of (1) federal net operating loss 67 Table of Contents (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $1.8 billion pretax expiring in 2024 to 2030, (2) approximately $20 million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration, (3) general business credit carryforwards of approximately $14 million expiring in 2023 to 2031, and (4) state NOL carryforwards of $3.3 billion expiring in 2012 to 2031 for which the associated deferred tax benefit, net of valuation allowance and federal tax impact, is $32 million. Our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period. These ownership changes include the offering of stock by us, the purchase or sale of our stock by 5% shareholders, as defined in the Treasury regulations, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock. If such ownership changes by 5% shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed 50 percentage points during the three year period, then Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards at the time of ownership change. The White House and the U.S. Department of the Treasury recently released a report entitled The Presidents Framework for Business Tax Reform in which President Obama recommended various changes to the Internal Revenue Code impacting businesses. Among the recommended changes is a proposal to reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 28%. If the tax rate change is enacted, we would be required to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower tax rate, which would result in a non cash charge to deferred tax expense of approximately $145 million. In addition, there are other proposed changes that could affect our depreciation and interest expense deductions, but we are unable to estimate the potential impact at this time. No legislation has been introduced in Congress to effectuate the proposed changes, and we cannot predict whether or when any such legislation might be enacted by Congress. Periodic examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing authorities could result in the payment of additional taxes. The IRS has completed audits of our tax returns for all tax years ended on or before December 31, 2007. All disputed issues with respect to these audits have been resolved, and all related tax assessments (including interest) have been paid. Tax returns for years ended after December 31, 2007 are not currently under examination by the IRS. SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily derived from cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We had approximately $113 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2011 to fund our operations and capital expenditures, and our borrowing availability under our credit facility was $527 million based on our borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2011. Our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable. As such, our operating cash flow is negatively impacted by lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt due to unfavorable shifts in payer mix, growth in admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients, and other factors. Net cash provided by operating activities was $497 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $472 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the 2011 and 2010 periods include the following: Increased income from continuing operations before income taxes of $95 million, excluding investment earnings, loss from early extinguishment of debt, interest expense, litigation and investigation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, and depreciation and amortization, in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010; Lower interest payments of $55 million; $30 million of proceeds from the interest rate swap agreement we terminated in August 2011, which generated approximately $8 million of cash interest savings and $22 million in proceeds from the termination of the agreement; Reduced cash flows associated with various changes in working capital and changes in long term liabilities, including the following: a $13 million receivable as of December 31, 2011 that is expected to be collected in 2012 related to state Medicaid EHR incentives under the HIT provisions of ARRA; a $16 million receivable recorded as of December 31, 2011 related to the California supplemental Medi Cal payment program that was approved by CMS in the three months ended December 31, 2011, which resulted in the recognition of $28 million of net revenues in the period; a $6 million receivable recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid by us prior to April 2005 on behalf of medical residents that we expect will be refunded to us in 2012; and $77 million of reduced net cash flows in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period related to accounts receivable primarily due to payment delays by certain government payers and a temporary delay in the adjudication of accounts receivable due to processing changes we implemented to capture long term operating efficiencies, partially offset by our management of liabilities; 68 Table of Contents Income tax payments of $10 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to income tax refunds of $34 million in the year ended December 31, 2010; Lower aggregate annual 401(k) matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of $20 million ($85 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $105 million in the year ended December 31, 2010); Lower payments on reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs of $39 million; and $47 million of additional cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations (including approximately $13 million in payments relating to the settlement of two class action lawsuits resulting from Hurricane Katrina). We continue to seek further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet by generating incremental cash. These initiatives include the sale of excess land, buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets. In December 2011, we sold seven medical office buildings in Texas for aggregate cash proceeds of $23 million. Capital expenditures were $475 million and $476 million in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, including approximately $13 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 for construction of a replacement hospital for our East Cooper Regional Medical Center in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. On May 9, 2011, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of our common stock through a share repurchase program. Under the program, shares could be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in a manner consistent with applicable securities laws and regulations, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5 1 plan maintained by the Company, at times and in amounts based on market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program, which was scheduled to expire on May 9, 2012, was completed in January 2012. Pursuant to the share repurchase program, we paid approximately $400 million to repurchase a total of 81,073,864 shares (or an average of $4.94 per share). We record our investments that are available for sale at fair market value. As shown in Note 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs. We have no investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the recent economic downturn that will materially impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND RELATED COVENANTS We have a senior secured revolving credit facility, as amended November 29, 2011 (Credit Agreement), that provides, subject to borrowing availability, for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $800 million, with a $300 million subfacility for standby letters of credit. The Credit Agreement has a scheduled maturity date of November 29, 2016, subject to our repayment or refinancing on or before December 3, 2014 of approximately $238 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 91/4% senior notes due 2015 (approximately $474 million of which was outstanding at December 31, 2011). If such repayment or refinancing does not occur, borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be due December 3, 2014. We are in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our Credit Agreement. Our borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement was $527 million based on our borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2011. There were $80 million of cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2011, and we had approximately $164 million of standby letters of credit outstanding. In November 2011, we sold $900 million aggregate principal amount of 61/4% senior secured notes due 2018. The notes will mature on November 1, 2018. We will pay interest on the 61/4% senior secured notes semi annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, with payments commencing on May 1, 2012. The notes rank equally with our 878% senior secured notes due 2019, our 9% senior secured notes due 2015 and our 10% senior secured notes due 2018, which we issued in the year ended December 31, 2009. Also in November 2011, we purchased approximately $713 million aggregate principal amount of our 9% senior secured notes due 2015 for total cash of approximately $776 million, including approximately $4 million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase. We purchased the senior secured notes with a portion of the proceeds from our sale of new 61/4% senior secured notes due 2018, as described above. In connection with the purchase, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $117 million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes, as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs associated with the notes. 69 Table of Contents We were party to an interest rate swap agreement for an aggregate notional amount of $600 million from February 14, 2011 through August 2, 2011. The interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was being used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates. It had the effect of converting our 10% senior secured notes due 2018 from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid semi annually based on the six month LIBOR plus a floating rate spread of 6.60%. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the 10% senior secured notes, which we expected to substantially offset each other, were recorded in interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our interest rate swap agreement generated approximately $8 million of cash interest savings and a $22 million gain on the settlement of the agreement. For additional information regarding our long term debt, see Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY From time to time, we expect to engage in additional capital markets, bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time. We believe our existing debt agreements provide significant flexibility for future secured or unsecured borrowings. Our cash on hand fluctuates day to day throughout the year based on the timing and levels of routine cash receipts and disbursements, including our book overdrafts, and required cash disbursements, such as interest and income tax payments. These fluctuations result in material intra quarter net operating and investing uses of cash that has caused, and in the future could cause, us to use our senior secured revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity. We may be required to pay the Medicare program approximately $50 million (which we reserved for in prior years) as a result of the SSI matter described under Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments under the caption Sources of Revenue above unless CMS changes its policy regarding the inclusion of Medicare Advantage days in the calculation of the SSI ratio prior to its removal of the moratorium on cost report settlements. We would be required to make the payments at the time of the cost report settlements pending the final outcome of our appeals related to this matter, which settlements could start occurring in 2012. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand, availability under our revolving credit facility, anticipated future cash provided by operating activities, and our investments in marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet should be adequate to meet our current cash needs. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures, payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs. Long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities and, given favorable market conditions, future borrowings or refinancings. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by the use of cash in acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of securities, and also by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections of this report, which could require us to pursue any number of financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt refinancings, asset sales or other financing alternatives. The level, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured. We do not rely on commercial paper or other short term financing arrangements nor do we enter into repurchase agreements or other short term financing arrangements not otherwise reported in our period end balance sheets. We do not have any significant European sovereign debt exposure. We continue to aggressively identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. Among the areas being addressed are volume growth, including the acquisition of outpatient businesses, physician recruitment and alignment strategies, expansion of our revenue cycle management services, managed care payer contracting, procurement efficiencies, cost standardization, bad debt expense reduction initiatives, underperforming hospitals, and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care. Although these initiatives may result in improved performance, that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 include $908 million, $874 million and $856 million, respectively, of net operating revenues and $115 million, $94 million and $99 million, respectively, of operating income generated from four general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements. In accordance with GAAP, the applicable buildings and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases. The current terms of these leases expire between 2014 and 2027, not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise. If these leases expire, we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals. 70 Table of Contents We have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, except for $319 million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of December 31, 2011. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use. In general, we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, given the particular circumstances in which we operate. Actual results may vary from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine, and (3) may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas: Recognition of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts, including contractual allowances; Provisions for doubtful accounts; Electronic health record incentives; Accruals for general and professional liability risks; Accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans; Accruals for litigation losses; Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill; Accounting for income taxes; and Accounting for stock based compensation. REVENUE RECOGNITION We recognize net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts in the period in which our services are performed. Net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates (i.e., gross charges), less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances, principally for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care and other health plans, as well as certain uninsured patients under the Compact. Revenues under the traditional fee for service Medicare and Medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems. Retrospectively determined cost based revenues under these programs, which were more prevalent in earlier periods, and certain other payments, such as DSH, DGME, IME and bad debt expense, which are based on our hospitals cost reports, are estimated using historical trends and current factors. Cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by Medicare and Medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review, and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved. Because the laws, regulations, instructions and rule interpretations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently, the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts. We have a system and estimation process for recording Medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements. This results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports. For filed cost reports, we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity, and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends. The accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports, and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. After the cost report is filed, the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted. 71 Table of Contents Revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements. These revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers. The payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis. At the end of each month, on an individual hospital basis, we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans. Based on reserves as of December 31, 2011, a 3% increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would change the estimated reserves by approximately $9 million. Some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include: (1) changes in reimbursement levels for procedures, supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered; (2) changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached; (3) changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing; (4) final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels; (5) secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments; and (6) reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels. Contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms, as well as payment history. Although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill, we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. We do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues. In addition, on a corporate wide basis, we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans. Revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the Compact, whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance. We believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements. We know of no material claims, disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our Consolidated Financial Statements. PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Although outcomes vary, our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients, including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). Generally, as required by EMTALA, patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay. Therefore, services, including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient, are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information. In non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services, it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated; however, there are various exceptions that can occur. Such exceptions can include, for example, instances where (1) we are unable to obtain verification because the patients insurance company was unable to be reached or contacted, (2) a determination is made that a patient may be eligible for benefits under various government programs, such as Medicaid or Victims of Crime, and it takes several days or weeks before qualification for such benefits is confirmed or denied, and (3) under physician orders we provide services to patients that require immediate treatment. We provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. We estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital, our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an 18 month look back period, and other relevant factors. Based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance as of December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease or increase in our self pay collection rate, or approximately 3%, which we believe could be a reasonable likely change, would result in an unfavorable or favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $6 million. There are various factors that can impact collection trends, such as changes in the economy, which in turn have an impact on unemployment rates and the number of uninsured and underinsured patients, the volume of patients through our emergency departments, the increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients with insurance, and business practices related to collection efforts. These factors continuously change and can have an impact on collection trends and our estimation process. Our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable, including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance, to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing. Generally, uncollected balances are assigned to our Conifer collection agency subsidiary between 90 to 180 days, once patient responsibility has been identified. When accounts are assigned to our Conifer collection agency subsidiary by the hospital, the 72 Table of Contents accounts are completely written off the hospitals books through the provision for doubtful accounts, and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospitals books at the same time. The estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates. The estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our Conifer collection agency subsidiary. Managed care accounts are collected through the regional business offices of Conifer, whereby the account balances remain in the related hospitals patient accounting system and on the hospitals books, and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age. Managed care accounts are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years. Changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts. We continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings. We aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal, including arbitration and litigation, but we may not be successful. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVES Under certain provisions of ARRA, federal incentive payments are available to hospitals, physicians and certain other professionals when they adopt, implement or upgrade (AIU) certified EHR technology or become meaningful users, as defined under ARRA, of EHR technology in ways that demonstrate improved quality, safety and effectiveness of care. Providers can become eligible for annual Medicare incentive payments by demonstrating meaningful use of EHR technology in each period over four periods. Medicaid providers can receive their initial incentive payment by satisfying AIU criteria, but must demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology in subsequent years in order to qualify for additional payments. Hospitals may be eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments; however, physicians and other professionals may be eligible for either Medicare or Medicaid incentive payments, but not both. Hospitals that are meaningful users under the Medicare EHR incentive payment program are deemed meaningful users under the Medicaid EHR incentive payment program and do not need to meet additional criteria imposed by a state. Medicaid EHR incentive payments to Providers are 100% federally funded and administered by the states. CMS established calendar year 2011 as the first year states could offer EHR incentive payments. Before a state may offer EHR incentive payments, the state must submit and CMS must approve the states incentive plan. We recognize Medicaid EHR incentive payments in our consolidated statements of operations for the first payment year when: (1) CMS approves a states EHR incentive plan; and (2) our hospital or employed physician acquires certified EHR technology (i.e., when AIU criteria are met). Medicaid EHR incentive payments for subsequent payment years are recognized in the period during which the specified meaningful use criteria are met. We recognize Medicare EHR incentive payments when: (1) the specified meaningful use criteria are met; and (2) contingencies in estimating the amount of the incentive payments to be received are resolved. The meaningful use information submitted to CMS is subject to review, verification and audit. Additionally, the final Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments under ARRA are based on financial and statistical data, which may be estimated using historical trends and current factors, in the settled Medicare cost report for the cost reporting period that begins in the federal fiscal year in which the criteria are met. We have acquired, developed and implemented systems to accumulate the information necessary to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology. We also have a system and estimation process for recording the financial and statistical data utilized as part of the cost reporting process. Cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period. Cost report settlements are subject to audit by Medicare and Medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review, and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved. Because the laws, regulations, instructions and rule interpretations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently, the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts. Final settlement of cost reports, which could impact the financial and statistical data on which EHR incentives are based, or a determination that meaningful use was not attained could result in adjustment to previously recognized EHR incentive payments or retrospective recoupment of incentive payments. 73 Table of Contents ACCRUALS FOR GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY RISKS We accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims, to the extent not covered by insurance, when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We maintain reserves, which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks, including incurred but not reported claims, to the extent we do not have insurance coverage. Our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors, including the number of expected claims, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, the timing of historical payments, and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments. We consider the number of expected claims, average cost per claim and discount rate to be the most significant assumptions in estimating accruals for general and professional liabilities. Our liabilities are adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known. Malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our estimated reserves for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We believe it is reasonably likely for there to be a 5% increase or decrease in the number of expected claims or average cost per claim. Based on our reserves and other information as of December 31, 2011, a 5% increase in the number of expected claims would increase the estimated reserves by $41 million, and a 5% decrease in the number of expected claims would decrease the estimated reserves by $24 million. A 5% increase in the average cost per claim would increase the estimated reserves by $64 million, and a 5% decrease in the average cost per claim would decrease the estimated reserves by $44 million. Because our estimated reserves for future claim payments are discounted to present value, a change in our discount rate assumption could also have a significant impact on our estimated reserves. Our discount rate was 1.35%, 2.71% and 2.69% at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the estimated reserves by $11 million. In addition, because of the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. The table below shows the case reserves and incurred but not reported and loss development reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Case reserves $ 111 $ 149 $ 153 Incurred but not reported and loss development reserves 319 357 472 Total undiscounted reserves $ 430 $ 506 $ 625 Several actuarial methods, including the incurred, paid loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, are applied to our historical loss data to produce estimates of ultimate expected losses and the resulting incurred but not reported and loss development reserves. These methods use our specific historical claims data related to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case reserves, reported and closed claim counts, and a variety of hospital census information. Based on these analyses, we determine our estimate of the professional liability claims, including the incurred but not reported and loss development reserve estimates. The determination of our estimates involves subjective judgment and could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods if our actual experience is materially different than our assumptions. Malpractice claims generally take 4 to 5 years to settle from the time of the initial reporting of the occurrence to the settlement payment. Accordingly, the percentage of undiscounted reserves as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 representing unsettled claims is approximately 98% and 99%, respectively. 74 Table of Contents The following table, which includes both our continuing and discontinued operations, presents the amount of our accruals for professional liability claims and the corresponding activity therein: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Accrual for professional liability claims, beginning of the year $ 467 $ 572 $ 663 Expense (income) related to:(1) Current year 107 125 121 Prior years 10 (98 ) (74 ) Expense from discounting 22 10 9 Total incurred loss and loss expense 139 37 56 Paid claims and expenses related to: Current year (2 ) (2 ) (1 ) Prior years (192 ) (140 ) (146 ) Total paid claims and expenses (194 ) (142 ) (147 ) Accrual for professional liability claims, end of year $ 412 $ 467 $ 572 (1) Total malpractice expense for continuing operations, including premiums for insured coverage, was $110 million, $57 million and $89 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. ACCRUALS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS Our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts. The discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement. We evaluate this critical assumption annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Our discount rate for 2011 was 5.0% and for 2010 was 5.50%. The assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. A 100 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for 2012 by approximately $4 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2011 by approximately $31 million. A 100 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease net periodic pension expense for 2012 by approximately $3 million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2011 by approximately $26 million. ACCRUALS FOR LITIGATION LOSSES We record reserves for litigation losses if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss. If a range of loss can be reasonably estimated, but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. These estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS We evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, we calculate the amount of an impairment charge if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals, established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. The estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable. They require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates. These assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. 75 Table of Contents We report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell. In such circumstances, our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows. Fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods. Many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates, including the following risks: future financial results of our hospitals, which can be impacted by volumes of insured patients and declines in commercial managed care patients, terms of managed care payer arrangements, our ability to collect accounts due from uninsured and managed care payers, loss of volumes as a result of competition, and our ability to manage costs such as labor costs, which can be adversely impacted by union activity and the shortage of experienced nurses; changes in payments from governmental health care programs and in government regulations such as reductions to Medicare and Medicaid payment rates resulting from government legislation or rule making or from budgetary challenges of states in which we operate; how the hospitals are operated in the future; and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of $27 million. This amount included a $6 million impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital, consistent with our previous estimates in prior years when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital, indicated the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients, shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers, and high levels of uninsured patients. As a result, we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospitals long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets. Because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospitals long lived assets, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts. Unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets, this hospital is at risk of future impairments, particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospitals fair value or if the fair value of the hospitals real estate or equipment continues to decline. The aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was $20 million as of December 31, 2011 after recording the impairment charge. Additionally, in our most recent impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011, we had three hospitals with an aggregate carrying value of long lived assets of approximately $223 million whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets by an aggregate amount of approximately $450 million. These three hospitals had the smallest excess of future undiscounted cash flows on an annual basis necessary to recover the carrying value of their assets. Future adverse trends that result in necessary changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates of future undiscounted cash flows could result in the hospitals estimated cash flows being less than the carrying value of the assets, which would require a fair value assessment of the long lived assets, and if the fair value amount is less than the carrying value of the assets, impairment charges would occur and could be material. We also recorded 2011 impairment charges of $1 million in connection with the sale of seven medical office buildings in Texas, $1 million related to a cost basis investment, $7 million in employee severance costs, $3 million in lease termination costs, $1 million of acceleration of stock based compensation costs and $2 million of other related costs. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually. For goodwill, we perform the test at the reporting unit level, as defined by applicable accounting standards, when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually. If we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired, or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value, then we reduce the carrying value, including any allocated goodwill, to fair value. Estimates of fair value are based on appraisals, established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future 76 Table of Contents net cash flows and presume stable, improving or, in some cases, declining results at our hospitals, depending on their circumstances. If the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected, impairment may result. Our continuing operations are structured as follows: Our California region includes all of our hospitals in California and Nebraska; Our Central region includes all of our hospitals in Missouri, Tennessee and Texas; Our Florida region includes all of our hospitals in Florida; and Our Southern States region includes all of our hospitals in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. These regions are reporting units used to perform our goodwill impairment analysis and are one level below our operating segment level. Our hospitals in Pennsylvania, which were previously part of a separate market, became part of our Southern States region effective May 1, 2011. This change did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we operate diagnostic imaging centers in Louisiana that are not part of our regional structure described above and are considered a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment analysis purposes. Future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill. Our goodwill balance is primarily related to our Southern States region, which totals approximately $346 million, and our Central region, which totals approximately $330 million. In our latest impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value of these regions exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets, including goodwill, by approximately 30% and 53%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a $6 million charge for the write off of goodwill associated with the diagnostic imaging centers in Louisiana. Material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of operating results of the centers, primarily due to our limited market presence, indicated that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value. As a result, we reduced the carrying value of the goodwill to its fair value determined based on an appraisal. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities. Developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. We assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified, we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The main factors that we consider include: Cumulative profits/losses in recent years, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items; Income/losses expected in future years; Unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels; The availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits; and The carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2010, we had not included projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance primarily as a result of negative evidence represented by our cumulative losses in recent years. However, during the year ended December 31, 2010, our judgment about the need for a 77 Table of Contents valuation allowance changed, and we concluded that the valuation allowance could be reduced to $66 million. As a result, the reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately $1.1 billion was recorded as a benefit in the provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Our change in judgment resulted from our assessment that positive evidence outweighed negative evidence during 2010 thereby resulting in the inclusion of projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance. The following factors were taken into account in our assessment: Cumulative profits for the three years ended December 31, 2010; Projected profits for 2011 based on current business plans; Carryforward periods for utilization of federal net operating loss carryovers; Significant improvement in operating performance in 2009 and 2010 as evidenced by: Improved cost controls; Successful renegotiation of managed care contracts on favorable terms; Successful quality control initiatives as reflected by improved clinical outcomes; Successful execution of physician alignment strategies; and Expansion of our outpatient business; and Formulation of strategic initiatives to address uncertainties presented by the Affordable Care Act and health information technology requirements under ARRA. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we reduced the valuation allowance by an additional $5 million based on 2011 profits and projected profits for 2012. The remaining $61 million balance in the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to certain state net operating loss carryovers that, more likely than not, will expire unutilized. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions, and such judgments are subject to periodic review. Tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied; (2) the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired. Tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied. While we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities, adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method, under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees, directors, advisors and consultants is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards, whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant, using a binomial lattice model. The key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include: Expected volatility; Expected dividend yield; Expected life; Expected forfeiture rate; Risk free interest rate range; Early exercise threshold; and Early exercise rate. The expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options. The expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options, and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges. The historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 due to unique events occurring during that time, 78 Table of Contents which caused extreme volatility of our stock price. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. This model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price. The risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes. The most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option, because it is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates. Accordingly, we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date. Our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of December 31, 2011. The fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. The average effective interest rates presented are based on the rate in effect at the reporting date. The effects of unamortized premiums and discounts are excluded from the table. Maturity Date, Years Ending December 31, 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value (Dollars in Millions) Fixed rate long term debt $ 66 $ 226 $ 67 $ 476 $ 2 $ 3,572 $ 4,409 $ 4,628 Average effective interest rates 6.4 % 7.7 % 10.2 % 9.5 % 7.3 % 9.0 % 9.0 % Variable rate long term debt $ $ $ $ $ 80 $ $ 80 $ 80 Average effective interest rates 2.78 % 2.78 % At December 31, 2011, the potential reduction of annual pretax earnings due to a one percentage point (100 basis point) increase in variable interest rates on long term debt would be approximately $1 million. At December 31, 2011, we had long term, market sensitive investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries. Our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as non current assets is substantially mitigated by the long term nature and type of the investments in the portfolio. At December 31, 2011, the net accumulated unrealized gains related to our captive insurance companies investment portfolios were less than $1 million. We have no affiliation with partnerships, trusts or other entities (sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities) whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements by us. Thus, we have no exposure to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risks associated with such entities. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. 79 Table of Contents
