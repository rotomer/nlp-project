Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to the fiscal year that ends on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Companys key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY CO. trademark. Management intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets. Management recognizes that over saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the TIFFANY CO. brand, but believes that there are a significant number of locations remaining worldwide that meet the requirements of a TIFFANY CO. location. To increase store productivity. Over the years, the Company has opened smaller size stores which have contributed to higher store productivity. In addition, the Company is focused on growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and the conversion rate (the percentage of shoppers who actually purchase) through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer focused initiatives. To achieve improved operating margins. Managements long term objective is to improve gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) through greater product manufacturing/sourcing efficiencies (including increased direct rough diamond sourcing and internal manufacturing) and increased use of distribution center capacity. Management also intends to improve the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales by controlling expenses and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. To enhance customer awareness. The TIFFANY CO. brand (the Brand) is the single most important asset of the Company and is inherent in consumer aspirations for the Brand. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase customer awareness of the Brand and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new collections and add new and innovative products to existing lines. To increase its control over product supply through greater direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Companys diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and or polish rough diamonds for use in Company merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. TIFFANY CO. K 26 Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and maintaining ongoing training programs. 2008 SUMMARY Net sales decreased 3% to $2,859,997,000 for the year ended January 31, 2009. Sales in most markets were affected by the global economic downturn, especially during the fourth quarter. Worldwide comparable store sales decreased 9% on a constant exchange rate basis (see Non GAAP Measures below). For the full year, comparable TIFFANY CO. store sales on a constant exchange rate basis decreased 14% in the Americas, decreased 4% in Asia Pacific due to a decline in Japan comparable store sales, and increased 6% in Europe due to growth in most countries. However, comparable store sales slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, declining 31% in the Americas and 13% in Asia Pacific, while Europe was equal to the prior year. The Company opened 22 TIFFANY CO. retail locations, net of closings, which increased its worldwide store base by 12% and by 9% on a square foot basis. Net earnings were $220,022,000, or 32% lower than the prior year, and net earnings per diluted share were $1.74, or 26% lower than the prior year. Included in net earnings were the following items: A pre tax charge of $97,839,000, or $0.46 per diluted share after tax, resulting from staffing reductions; A $12,373,000 pre tax impairment charge, or $0.07 per diluted share after tax, for an investment in Target Resources plc, a mining and exploration company; A pre tax charge of $7,549,000, or $0.04 per diluted share after tax, due to inventory and other charges related to the anticipated closing of the Companys IRIDESSE stores; and A $3,382,000 pre tax charge, or $0.02 per diluted share after tax, for the closing of a diamond polishing facility in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The Company secured additional financing in order to refinance certain maturing debt as well as to provide for the Companys long term working capital needs. The Company repurchased 5.4 million shares of its Common Stock. The Company suspended share repurchases during the third quarter of 2008 in order to conserve cash. In May 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. NON GAAP MEASURES The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant exchange rate basis). Management believes this constant exchange rate TIFFANY CO. K 27 measurement provides a more representative assessment of the sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2008 2007 Constant Constant GAAP Translation Exchange GAAP Translation Exchange Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide (3 )% 1 % (4 )% 15 % 2 % 13 % Americas (10 )% (10 )% 12 % 1 % 11 % U.S. (11 )% (11 )% 10 % 10 % Asia Pacific 8 % 7 % 1 % 14 % 2 % 12 % Japan 7 % 14 % (7 )% 1 % 1 % Other Asia Pacific 10 % (2 )% 12 % 38 % 4 % 34 % Europe 17 % (8 )% 25 % 31 % 9 % 22 % Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide (7 )% 2 % (9 )% 8 % 1 % 7 % Americas (14 )% (14 )% 8 % 8 % U.S. (16 )% (16 )% 7 % 7 % Asia Pacific 4 % 8 % (4 )% 7 % 2 % 5 % Japan 4 % 14 % (10 )% (4 )% 1 % (5 )% Other Asia Pacific 3 % (2 )% 5 % 31 % 5 % 26 % Europe 1 % (5 )% 6 % 22 % 9 % 13 % TIFFANY CO. K 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In the first quarter of 2008, the Company changed its method of accounting for inventories held by its U.S. subsidiaries and foreign branches from the last in, first out (LIFO) method to the average cost method.
