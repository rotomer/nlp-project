Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years that end on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Companys key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY CO. trademark (the Brand). Management intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets. Management recognizes that over saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of locations remaining worldwide that meet the requirements of the Brand. To increase store productivity. Over the years, the Company has opened smaller size stores which have contributed to higher store productivity. In addition, the Company is focused on growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and the conversion rate (the percentage of shoppers who actually purchase) through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer focused initiatives. To achieve improved operating margins. Managements long term objective is to improve gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) through greater product manufacturing/sourcing efficiencies and increased use of distribution center capacity. Management also intends to improve the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales by controlling expenses and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. To enhance customer awareness. The Brand is the single most important asset of the Company and is inherent in consumer aspirations for the Brand. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase customer awareness of the Brand and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new collections and add new and innovative products to existing lines. TIFFANY CO. K 24 Table of Contents To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Companys diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and or polish rough diamonds for use in Company merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and maintaining ongoing training programs. 2009 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales decreased 5% to $2,709,704,000 in 2009. Sales in most markets were affected by the global economic downturn that began in the latter half of 2008. Full year sales in the Americas declined in 2009 but increased in the fourth quarter. Full year sales in both Asia Pacific and Europe increased in 2009. Worldwide comparable store sales decreased 8% on a constant exchange rate basis (see Non GAAP Measures below), consisting of a 14% decline in the Americas, a 3% decline in Asia Pacific (due to a decline in Japan) and a 9% increase in Europe (due to growth in all countries). However, in the fourth quarter, worldwide comparable store sales on a constant exchange rate basis increased 8%, including increases of 10% in the Americas, 3% in Asia Pacific and 14% in Europe. The Company opened 14 TIFFANY CO. retail locations, net of two closings, which increased its worldwide store base by 7% and its square footage by 5%. A decline in operating expenses reflected the Companys cost saving initiatives announced at the end of 2008 that included significant reductions in staffing and marketing spending. Net earnings increased 20% to $264,823,000 and net earnings per diluted share increased 21% to $2.11. Net earnings in 2009 and 2008 are not comparable due to several nonrecurring items recorded in those periods (see Item 6. Selected Financial Data Notes to Selected Financial Data for a listing of those items). Excluding those nonrecurring items in both years, 2009 net earnings would have decreased 14% to $254,367,000 from $294,263,000 in 2008, and 2009 net earnings per diluted share would have decreased 13% to $2.03 from $2.33 in 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company secured $300,000,000 of additional long term financing in order to refinance certain maturing debt and to provide for the Companys long term expansion plan. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company established a new $400,000,000 multi bank, multi currency revolving credit facility to replace an expiring facility. TIFFANY CO. K 25 Table of Contents NON GAAP MEASURES The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant exchange rate basis). Management believes this constant exchange rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non GAAP basis versus the previous years: 2009 2008 Constant Constant GAAP Translation Exchange GAAP Translation Exchange Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide (5 )% % (5 )% (3 )% 1 % (4 )% Americas (11 ) (11 ) (10 ) (10 ) U.S. (12 ) (12 ) (11 ) (11 ) Asia Pacific 4 4 8 7 1 Japan (4 ) 7 (11 ) 7 14 (7 ) Other Asia Pacific 18 (1 ) 19 10 (2 ) 12 Europe 10 (6 ) 16 17 (8 ) 25 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide (7 )% 1 % (8 )% (7 )% 2 % (9 )% Americas (14 ) (14 ) (14 ) (14 ) U.S. (15 ) (15 ) (16 ) (16 ) Asia Pacific 1 4 (3 ) 4 8 (4 ) Japan (4 ) 7 (11 ) 4 14 (10 ) Other Asia Pacific 8 8 3 (2 ) 5 Europe 3 (6 ) 9 1 (5 ) 6 TIFFANY CO.

Gross Margin 2009 2008 2007 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 56.5 % 57.8 % 56.4 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) declined 1.3 percentage points in 2009 and improved 1.4 percentage points in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to higher product costs. The primary components of the increase in 2008 were: (i) a 0.7 percentage point improvement due to a $19,212,000 pre tax charge in 2007 related to managements decision to discontinue certain watch models; (ii) a 0.3 percentage point improvement due to decreased wholesale sales of diamonds; and (iii) the benefit from the Companys precious metals hedging program. Management periodically reviews and may adjust retail prices to address specific market conditions, product cost increases/decreases and longer term changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Among the market conditions that the Company addresses is consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence and competitive pricing conditions. The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see
