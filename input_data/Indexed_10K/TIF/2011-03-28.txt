Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years that end on January 31 of the following calendar year. Effective with the first quarter of 2010, management changed the Companys segment reporting in order to align with a change in its organizational and management reporting structure. Specifically, the Company is now reporting results in Japan separately from the rest of the Asia Pacific region, and results for certain emerging market countries that were previously included in the Europe and Asia Pacific segments are now included in the Other non reportable segment. Prior year results have been revised to reflect this change. KEY STRATEGIES The Companys key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY CO. trademark (the Brand). Management employs a multi channel distribution strategy. Management intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets, and by launching e commerce websites in new markets. Management recognizes that over saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet the requirements of the Brand. To enhance customer awareness. The Brand is the single most important asset of the Company. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase new and existing customer awareness of the Brand and its message, and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To increase store productivity. Over the years, the Company has opened smaller size stores (especially in the United States) which have contributed to higher store productivity. In addition, the Company is committed to growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and the conversion rate (the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase) through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer focused initiatives. To achieve improved operating margins. Managements long term objective is to improve gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) through greater efficiencies in product sourcing, manufacturing and distribution. Management also intends to improve the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales by controlling expenses and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. TIFFANY CO. K 25 Table of Contents To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new design collections and expand existing lines. To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Companys diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and or polish rough diamonds for use in Company merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and enhancing ongoing training programs. 2010 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 14% to $3,085,290,000, due to growth in all reportable segments. On a constant exchange rate basis (see Non GAAP Measures below), worldwide net sales increased 12% and comparable store sales increased 8%. The Company added a net of 13 TIFFANY CO. stores (five in the Americas, seven in Asia Pacific, two in Europe and a net reduction of one in Japan). The Company launched e commerce websites in eight European countries. Operating margin increased 3.0 percentage points due to a higher gross margin and the leverage effect of increased sales compared with the growth in selling, general and administrative expenses. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 39% to $368,403,000, or $2.87 per diluted share. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 and 2009 are not comparable due to several nonrecurring items recorded in those periods (see Item 6. Selected Financial Data Notes to Selected Financial Data for a listing of those items). Excluding those nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings from continuing operations would have increased 47% to $376,075,000, or $2.93 per diluted share from $255,220,000, or $2.04 per diluted share, in 2009. The Company issued, at par, 10,000,000,000 ($118,430,000 at issuance) of 1.72% Senior Notes due September 2016. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of 15,000,000,000 ($178,845,000 upon payment) of debt that came due in September. The Company also repaid $40,000,000 of debt that came due in December. The Board of Directors approved two increases, totaling 47%, in the dividend on the Companys Common Stock increasing the annual dividend rate to $1.00 per share. TIFFANY CO. K 26 Table of Contents NON GAAP MEASURES The Companys reported sales reflect either a translation related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars (constant exchange rate basis). Management believes this constant exchange rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Companys management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Companys operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non GAAP basis versus the previous years: 2010 2009 Constant Constant GAAP Translation Exchange GAAP Translation Exchange Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 14 % 2 % 12 % (5 )% % (5 )% Americas 12 1 11 (11 ) (11 ) Asia Pacific 29 6 23 17 (2 ) 19 Japan 7 8 (1 ) (4 ) 7 (11 ) Europe 18 (5 ) 23 12 (7 ) 19 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide 10 % 2 % 8 % (7 )% 1 % (8 )% Americas 9 1 8 (14 ) (14 ) Asia Pacific 19 5 14 8 8 Japan 4 8 (4 ) (4 ) 7 (11 ) Europe 13 (5 ) 18 3 (6 ) 9 TIFFANY CO.

Sales per gross square foot generated by all stores were approximately $2,600 in 2010, $2,400 in 2009 and $2,600 in 2008. TIFFANY CO. K 29 Table of Contents Other. Other consists of all non reportable segments. Other consists primarily of wholesale sales of TIFFANY CO. merchandise to independent distributors for resale in certain emerging markets (such as the Middle East and Russia) and wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Companys needs. In addition, Other includes earnings received from third party licensing agreements. In 2010, Other sales increased $901,000, or 2%, as increased wholesale sales of TIFFANY CO. merchandise to independent distributors was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales of diamonds. In 2009, Other sales declined $39,308,000, or 42%, due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and decreased wholesale sales of TIFFANY CO. merchandise to independent distributors. Gross Margin 2010 2009 2008 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 59.1 % 56.5 % 57.8 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased by 2.6 percentage points in 2010 driven primarily by the recapture of higher product costs through retail price increases, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. The 1.3 percentage point decrease in 2009 was primarily due to higher product costs. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate, as it did by increasing prices in 2010, to address specific market conditions, product cost increases and longer term changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Among the market conditions that the Company addresses is consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence and competitive pricing conditions. The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see
