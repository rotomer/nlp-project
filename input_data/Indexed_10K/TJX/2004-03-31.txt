Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1 of this report under the section entitled Safe Harbor Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Results of Operations Overview: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) the Companys diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.28, which was in the upper end of our planned range. Our strong results helped us to achieve an after tax return on average shareholders equity of 44%. We achieved this performance, despite below plan growth in both same store and total sales, by growing our pre tax profit margin (the ratio of pre tax income to sales). The pre tax profit margin increase was achieved primarily through improvement to our merchandise margins, the result of effective inventory management and merchandising strategies. Pre tax profit margin also benefited from disciplined expense management and was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 calendar. We continued to grow our business, opening 188 new stores (net of closings) and, excluding the acquisition of Bobs Stores, increasing our store count 10% to 2,031. Bobs Stores, a value oriented chain of 31 stores located in the Northeast United States, was acquired in December 2003, as a platform for future growth. Strong cash flows from operations allowed us to fund our capital expenditure requirements and the Bobs Stores acquisition, while continuing our stock buyback program. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 27 million shares at a cost of $515 million, which contributed to earnings per share growth. Our ability to continue to report annual earnings per share growth will be driven by revenue growth from our new store openings along with increases in same store sales, maintaining steady profit margins, and the benefit from our share repurchase program. The execution of our buying strategies and disciplined inventory management, leading to rapid inventory turns, are key factors to our continued success. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated. All earnings per share calculations and per share data have been adjusted to give effect for the two for one stock split distributed on May 8, 2002. Net sales: Net sales for TJX for our fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, totaled $13.3 billion, an 11.2% increase over sales of $12.0 billion for our fiscal year ended January 25, 2003 (fiscal 2003). The net sales for fiscal 2003 represented an 11.9% increase over sales of $10.7 billion for our fiscal year ended January 26, 2002 (fiscal 2002). Our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2003 and 2002. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 increased net sales by an estimated 1.5% over fiscal 2003. The 11% increase in net sales for fiscal 2004 includes approximately 8% from new stores, 1% from same store sales growth, with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week. Each of these factors includes the favorable effect of changes in the currency exchange rates of our Winners and T.K. Maxx operations. Same store sales in fiscal 2004 benefited approximately 1 1/2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates. The 11% growth in net sales for the year was less than we had planned, primarily due to lower than expected same store sales. The increase in net sales of 12% in fiscal 2003 includes approximately 9% from new stores and 3% from same store sales growth. Foreign currency exchange rate changes also favorably impacted fiscal 2003 sales growth but to a much lesser extent than the impact in fiscal 2004. New stores are our major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count, excluding Bobs Stores, increased by 10.2% in fiscal 2004 and 10.7% in fiscal 2003 over the respective prior year period. Our selling square footage, excluding Bobs Stores, increased by 9.6% in fiscal 2004 and by 10.1% in fiscal 2003, in each case over the prior year. Our acquisition of Bobs Stores on December 24, 2003, added 31 units as of the end of 13 Table of Contents fiscal 2004. Net sales for Bobs Stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition, although the impact on sales growth was not significant. Consolidated same store sales growth of 1% in fiscal 2004 (including foreign currency benefit) was less than planned, largely due to the effect of unseasonable weather in the first half of the year. The sales results for fiscal 2003 reflected strong demand for home fashions and were achieved despite a weak economy, geopolitical concerns and a highly promotional retail environment. Same store sales growth in both years was favorably affected by our younger divisions as their share of consolidated results continues to increase. We expect to add 182 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal 2005, an 8.8% increase in our consolidated store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 8.9%. We have planned a 4% to 5% increase in same store sales and a 13% increase in total sales for fiscal 2005. We estimate that approximately 1% to 1.5% of this sales growth will come from favorable currency exchange rates. We plan on adding or expanding certain departments in many of our stores to help drive our same store sales growth. These initiatives are discussed in more detail below. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and expanded stores are generally classified in the same way as the original store. We believe that the impact of relocated or expanded stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions, because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.6 75.8 75.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.2 16.2 15.7 Interest expense, net .2 .2 .2 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 8.0 % 7.8 % 8.2 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.6% in fiscal 2004, 75.8% in fiscal 2003 and 75.9% in fiscal 2002. This ratio in fiscal 2004 was better than our plan and reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin, primarily in the second half of fiscal 2004. The improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate .6% reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio. Successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement. The improvement in this ratio in fiscal 2004 was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lower than planned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs, as a result of opening our new T.J. Maxx distribution facility in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .3% for fiscal 2004 over last year and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .1%. The cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. The benefit from the 14 Table of Contents 53rd week in fiscal 2004, which we estimate to be a .2% improvement in this ratio, is reflected in the results discussed above. The improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2003 is largely due to the improvement in merchandise margin at Winners, HomeGoods and T.K. Maxx due to reduced markdowns resulting from improved inventory liquidity. These improvements in fiscal 2003 offset an increase in this ratio of approximately .3% at Marmaxx. In fiscal 2003, Marmaxx experienced higher distribution costs, store occupancy costs and insurance and employee benefit costs as a percentage of net sales. Marmaxx was also impacted in fiscal 2003 by a less than planned sales performance. We anticipate the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2005 will be similar to fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.2% in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and 15.7% in fiscal 2002. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat compared to fiscal 2003 and in line with our plan. Store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal 2004 as a result of the levering impact of less than planned sales, but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a $16 million litigation charge. The litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four California lawsuits that alleged TJX had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from California overtime laws. The lawsuits were settled and paid in fiscal 2004 for slightly less than $16 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2003 increased by approximately .3% due to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits and increases in store payroll attributable to lower employee turnover. The charge for the California lawsuits in fiscal 2003 increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by .1%. We anticipate this expense ratio to increase in fiscal 2005 by .3% to .4% compared to fiscal 2004. This anticipated increase is largely due to the impact of the planned expansion of certain departments at many of our stores as well as increased costs for medical and retirement benefits. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $27.3 million in fiscal 2004, $25.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $25.6 million in fiscal 2002. Interest income was $6.5 million in fiscal 2004 versus $10.5 million in fiscal 2003 and $15.0 million in fiscal 2002. The reduction in interest income in fiscal 2004 was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. The reduction in interest income in fiscal 2003 was due to lower interest rates. The decrease in gross interest expense in fiscal 2003 is due to the inclusion in fiscal 2002s interest expense of amortization of debt expenses relating to the zero coupon convertible notes issued in February 2001 (see Note C to the consolidated financial statements). We expect net interest expense to increase slightly in fiscal 2005. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.4% in fiscal 2004, 38.3% in fiscal 2003 and 38.2% in fiscal 2002. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2004 reflects increases in state income taxes compared to fiscal 2003. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 includes the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of split dollar arrangements as described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. This improvement in the effective tax rate was completely offset by the effect of increases in state income tax rates in fiscal 2003. The slight increase in the effective rate for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is due to the impact of a one time benefit in foreign taxes in fiscal 2002. Based on our operating plans for fiscal 2005 and an anticipated increase in state income taxes, we are planning a tax rate for fiscal 2005 of 38.6%. Income from continuing operations/net income: Income from continuing operations was $658.4 million in fiscal 2004, $578.4 million in fiscal 2003, and $540.4 million in fiscal 2002. Income from continuing operations per share was $1.28 in fiscal 2004, versus 15 Table of Contents $1.08 in fiscal 2003 and $.97 in fiscal 2002. Net income for fiscal 2002 includes an after tax charge of $40 million, or $.07 per share, due to discontinued operations for contingent lease obligations associated with House2Home, Inc. as described in Note L to the consolidated financial statements. Net income, after reflecting the above item, was $658.4 million, or $1.28 per share, in fiscal 2004, $578.4 million, or $1.08 per share, in fiscal 2003 and $500.4 million, or $.90 per share, in fiscal 2002. We estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added $.05 to our earnings per share and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to our earnings per share. The increase in earnings per share, on a percentage basis, in all periods increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2005 with planned spending of $550 million. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense, goodwill amortization (prior to fiscal 2003) and interest. Segment profit or loss, as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes can be found in Note O to the consolidated financial statements. MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 9,937.2 $ 9,485.6 $ 8,863.1 Segment profit $ 961.6 $ 887.9 $ 893.7 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.7 % 9.4 % 10.1 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales (1 )% 2 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,418 1,342 1,269 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 34,101 32,271 30,468 Marmaxx had a 1% same store sales decrease in fiscal 2004, which was below our plan and also below last years 2% increase. Despite a below plan sales performance, Marmaxx segment profit margin was above plan as a result of sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense control. With an expanded distribution capacity, Marmaxx was able to make closer to need buys in fiscal 2004, leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin, especially in the second half of the year. The Marmaxx segment profit margin was also favorably impacted in fiscal 2004 by the 53rd week, as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. We estimate this impact to be ..2%. Marmaxx segment profit improvement in fiscal 2004 also reflects the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to the $16 million litigation charge. This charge also reduced segment profit margin by .2% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, Marmaxx maintained a liquid inventory position throughout the year, a key factor in this divisions maintaining its merchandise margin in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The overall reduction in segment profit margin for fiscal 2003 reflected increases in insurance and employee benefits, which accounted for a .3% drop in the segment profit margin. Lower than planned sales and increased store payroll costs, due in part to lower attrition, also reduced the segment profit margin in fiscal 2003. New stores for Marmaxx in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 performed above expectations. We added a net of 76 new stores in fiscal 2004 and increased total selling square footage by 6%. We expect to open a net of 60 new stores in fiscal 2005, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 4%. We expect to increase our selling square footage by 5%. 16 Table of Contents WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,076.3 $ 793.2 $ 660.9 Segment profit $ 106.7 $ 85.3 $ 59.1 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.9 % 10.8 % 8.9 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 19 % 5 % 1 % Local currency 4 % 5 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 160 146 131 HomeSense 25 15 7 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 3,576 3,261 2,885 HomeSense 468 282 120 Same store sales (in local currency) for Winners and HomeSense increased by 4% in fiscal 2004, slightly less than planned, on top of a 5% increase in the prior year. New stores for Winners and HomeSense performed above expectations in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. Segment profit increased 25% in fiscal 2004 versus a 44% increase in fiscal 2003, and was slightly above our plan due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates. We estimate that approximately two thirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Winners and HomeSense segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was below plan and last year. The reduction in segment profit margin as compared to fiscal 2003 reflects increased markdowns at Winners and the increasing impact of HomeSense on their combined results. HomeSense is at an earlier stage of development and operates with higher expense ratios than does Winners. In fiscal 2003, results were driven by a significant improvement in merchandise margin as a result of better inventory management as well as improved merchandise flow and mix throughout the year. HomeSense net sales were 10% of this groups total net sales in fiscal 2004 and 7% of total net sales in fiscal 2003. We added 14 Winners stores and 10 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2004, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 14%. In fiscal 2004, Winners also opened its first superstore which combines a Winners store with a HomeSense store. We expect to open 8 Winners and 15 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2005, including seven superstores, increasing our total Canadian store base by 12%, and increasing selling square footage by 13%. T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 992.2 $ 720.1 $ 520.5 Segment profit $ 59.1 $ 43.0 $ 13.0 Segment profit as % of net sales 6.0 % 6.0 % 2.5 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 16 % 11 % 1 % Local currency 6 % 5 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period 147 123 101 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,841 2,282 1,852 T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, recorded sales and segment profit that exceeded plan. Same store sales increased 6% in local currency in fiscal 2004, on top of a 5% increase in the 17 Table of Contents prior year. New stores for fiscal 2004 performed above our expectations. Segment profit increased 37% in fiscal 2004, and we estimate that approximately one quarter of the growth in segment profit during fiscal 2004 resulted from changes in currency exchange rates. The strong segment performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by T.K. Maxxs strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies. In fiscal 2003, segment profit increased 232%, as we saw a significant increase in merchandise margin driven by improvements in inventory management. The growth in segment profit for fiscal 2003 was also favorably impacted by changes in currency exchange rates, which accounted for approximately 10% of the increase in segment profit. We added 24 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2004, and increased selling square footage by 24%. The actual store openings were six fewer than we originally planned, but our increased use of mezzanine selling floors added selling square footage during fiscal 2004 and helped offset the fewer store openings. With mezzanine space, we increase our selling space with little additional rental costs, thus increasing store productivity. We plan to open an additional 25 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2005, and expand selling square footage by 26%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 876.5 $ 705.1 $ 507.2 Segment profit $ 49.8 $ 32.1 $ 3.7 Segment profit as % of net sales 5.7 % 4.6 % 0.7 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 6 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period 182 142 112 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 3,548 2,830 2,279 HomeGoods same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2004, less than planned, compared to a 6% increase in the prior year. Segment profit increased by 55% in fiscal 2004 to $49.8 million, and was above our plan, despite less than planned sales performance. The better than plan segment profit reflects HomeGoods continued solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies, and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as the business grows. New stores in both fiscal years performed above expectations. In fiscal 2003, segment profit margins were up significantly as we saw improvements in merchandising, inventory management, store operations and distribution. We opened a net of 40 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2004, a 28% increase, and increased selling square footage by 25%. In fiscal 2005, we plan on adding a net of 40 new HomeGoods stores and increasing selling square footage by 20%. A.J. WRIGHT: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 421.6 $ 277.2 $ 157.3 Segment profit (loss) $ 1.7 $ (12.6 ) $ (11.8 ) Percent increase in same store sales 8 % 11 % 18 % Stores in operation at end of period 99 75 45 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 1,967 1,498 916 A.J. Wright sales were up 52% in fiscal 2004 to $421.6 million, due to an 8% increase in same store sales and 24 new stores. In fiscal 2004, although same store sales were slightly below our plan, total net sales were above plan, reflecting the strong performance of new stores. A.J. Wright achieved a segment profit of $1.7 million in fiscal 2004, which was well ahead of plan and up significantly compared to a segment loss of $12.6 million in fiscal 2003. The improvement in A.J. Wrights segment profit is primarily the impact of 18 Table of Contents improved merchandising and strong inventory management leading to improved merchandise margins. Segment profit for fiscal 2004 also includes a $1.7 million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property. In fiscal 2003, A.J. Wrights segment loss was impacted, in part, by the unseasonably warm weather in the third quarter in areas of the country where A.J. Wright has a large concentration of stores. A.J. Wrights aggressive store opening program for fiscal 2003 also placed strains on this young division and resulted in some execution issues, which negatively impacted the bottom line in fiscal 2003. We added 24 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2004, increasing selling square footage by 31%. In fiscal 2005, we plan to add 32 new stores and increase selling square footage by 31%. BOBS STORES: On December 24, 2003 we completed the acquisition of Bobs Stores, a value oriented casual, family apparel retailer operating 31 stores. The results of Bobs Stores are included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2004, Bobs Stores contributed $24.1 million to net sales and generated a segment loss of $5 million. We currently operate 31 Bobs Stores and expect to open 2 additional stores in fiscal 2005. We plan to evaluate and further develop this concept before initiating significant expansion plans. We do not anticipate Bobs Stores having a significant impact on TJXs earnings over the next several years. GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2004 2003 2002 (53 weeks) General corporate expense $ 78.4 $ 72.8 $ 55.3 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the non divisional departments for accounting and budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the benefit costs of existing retirees and non operating costs and unusual gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 is primarily the result of contributions to The TJX Foundation of $9.8 million in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, there were no contributions to The TJX Foundation. This increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity. Fiscal 2004 includes approximately $1 million in income due to net foreign exchange gains and losses as compared to approximately $5 million in net charges in fiscal 2003. The majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity. We have not elected hedge accounting for these contracts; thus, the changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2004, the unrealized fair value of derivative contracts outstanding has been allocated to the related segments. The increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 reflects increased costs for retirement and medical benefits of approximately $3 million, as well as a pre tax charge of approximately $2 million in connection with the transaction terminating split dollar life insurance policies for two senior executives as described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. This pre tax charge was offset by tax benefits of $3.8 million in the income tax provision. Fiscal 2003 also includes approximately $5 million in net charges due to foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity as compared to a net gain of less than $1 million in fiscal 2002. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $770.5 million in fiscal 2004, $908.6 million in fiscal 2003, and $912.4 million in fiscal 2002. The cash generated from operating activities each fiscal period is largely due to strong operating earnings. The decline in net cash provided from operations in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily a result of an increase in our inventory (net of related increase in accounts payable) at the end of fiscal 2004 compared to the end of fiscal 2003. Inventories per store at January 31, 2004 were up 11% compared to the prior year, and inventories per store at January 25, 2003 were down 3% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, inventories per store at January 31, 2004 increased 9% over the prior year. This increase in inventory was attributable in part to our plan to raise the level of store inventories over fiscal 2003 levels. The timing of inventory receipts, in part due to the 53rd week, also contributed to the higher inventory levels at January 31, 2004. The cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2004 were also impacted by a lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflects reduced accruals for property additions at the end of fiscal 2004 and the payment of the California lawsuits in fiscal 2004. The significant cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 is largely due to strong operating earnings along with our liquid inventory position and our buying closer to need. Cash flows for fiscal 2003 also reflect the favorable impact of an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses for fiscal 2003 reflects the reserve for the settlement of the California lawsuits, and higher accruals for property additions, payroll and benefits, merchandise credits and occupancy costs. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were favorably impacted by additional deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and due to increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for U.S. income tax purposes. The cash flows from operating activities have been reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of $17.5 million in fiscal 2004, $58.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $46.8 million in fiscal 2002. All of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and $26.0 million of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2002, were made on a voluntary basis. Cash flows from operating activities were also reduced by $37.2 million in fiscal 2004, $32.2 million in fiscal 2003, and $4.1 million in fiscal 2002, for cash expenditures charged against the discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of the former House2Home and Zayre Stores, for which TJX is an original lessee or guarantor. These discontinued operations are being liquidated in bankruptcy by third parties. The reserve activity in prior years also reflects leases of Hit or Miss, another discontinued operation that liquidated in the bankruptcy of a third party. The reserve was established at various times subsequent to TJXs disposition of these businesses, when the companies then owning them suffered significant financial distress. When discontinued operations were sold to third parties, TJX generally remained secondarily liable with respect to lease obligations if the purchaser fails to perform, unless there are circumstances that terminate or reduce TJXs potential liability. The reserve reflects TJXs estimation of its cost for claims that have been, or are likely to be, made against TJX based on potential secondary liability after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. Mitigating factors include assignments to third parties, lease terminations, expirations, subleases, buyouts, modifications and other actions, legal defenses and use by TJX for its store opening program. At January 31, 2004, substantially all of the House2Home, Zayre Stores and Hit or Miss leases that were rejected in the bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved as a result of negotiated buyouts, assignments to third parties, leasing for TJXs own use or for sublease and lease expirations. It is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or expired, but TJX does not expect any such costs to be material. 20 Table of Contents The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below. The addition to the reserve in fiscal 2002 relates to House2Home. The charges against the reserve during fiscal 2004 relate primarily to House2Home and Zayre Stores lease obligations; during fiscal 2003, the charges relate primarily to House2Home lease obligations; and during fiscal 2002, the charges relate primarily to former Zayre Stores and Hit or Miss locations. Fiscal Year Ended January In Thousands 2004 2003 2002 Balance at beginning of year $ 55,361 $ 87,284 $ 25,512 Additions to the reserve 66,528 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (37,208 ) (32,189 ) (4,090 ) All other (635 ) 266 (666 ) Balance at end of year $ 17,518 $ 55,361 $ 87,284 We do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve. In addition, we expect to receive a creditor recovery in the House2Home bankruptcy, although the amount has not yet been determined. We may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of BJs Wholesale Club for which BJs Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJs Wholesale Club. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on any property we have leased or guaranteed and assigned to third parties without being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned or guaranteed leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations discussed in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, BJs Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $140 million as of January 31, 2004. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. 21 Table of Contents Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In Millions 2004 2003 New stores $ 164.7 $ 136.5 Store renovations and improvements 147.3 124.3 Office and distribution centers 97.0 135.9 Capital expenditures $ 409.0 $ 396.7 Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 were less than planned primarily due to lower than planned spending on office facilities and information systems. We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $500 million for fiscal 2005. This includes $188 million for new stores, $221 million for store renovations and improvements and $91 million for our office and distribution centers. Our planned rate of new store growth per year is in the 8% to 9% range on a consolidated basis for the next several years. Our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores, are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures. Investing activities for fiscal 2004 include a net cash outflow of $57.1 million to acquire Bobs Stores as discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements. Investing activities for fiscal 2002 include $5.5 million of cash outlays due to advances we made under a construction loan agreement, in connection with the expansion of our leased home office facility. We received repayments under this loan agreement of $606,000 in fiscal 2004, $564,000 in fiscal 2003 and $125,000 in fiscal 2002. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $546.8 million in fiscal 2004, $509.1 million in fiscal 2003, and $99.7 million in fiscal 2002. The majority of this activity relates to our share repurchase program and our long term borrowings. We spent $520.7 million in fiscal 2004, $481.7 million in fiscal 2003, and $424.2 million in fiscal 2002 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004, 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2003, and 26.3 million shares in fiscal 2002. All shares repurchased are retired with the exception of 75,000 shares purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87,638 shares purchased in fiscal 2003 all of which are held in treasury. During July 2002, we completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common stock over several years. Since the inception of the new $1 billion stock repurchase program, as of January 31, 2004, we have repurchased 43.0 million shares at a total cost of $818.6 million. All of these repurchased share numbers reflect the two for one stock split distributed in May 2002. On February 13, 2001, we issued $517.5 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in February 2021 and raised gross proceeds of $347.6 million. The issue price of the notes represented a yield to maturity of 2% per year. The notes are convertible into 16.9 million shares of common stock of TJX if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds, if the credit rating of the notes is below investment grade, if the notes are called for redemption, or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. None of these conditions existed as of January 31, 2004, January 25, 2003 or January 26, 2002 and thus the shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations. The holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes in February 2007 and February 2013. We may pay the purchase price in cash, our stock, or a combination of the two. If the holders exercise this option, we expect to fund the payment with cash, financing from our short term credit facility, new long term borrowings, or a combination thereof. At the earlier put date of February 13, 2002 no holders exercised the purchase option, and more recently on February 13, 2004, only $3,000 in face value of bonds was put to TJX which were settled in cash. We used the proceeds for our accelerated store roll out program, investment in our distribution center network, general 22 Table of Contents corporate purposes and our common stock repurchase program. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of $15 million in fiscal 2004, and $73,000 in fiscal 2002. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $.14 per share in fiscal 2004, $.12 per share in fiscal 2003, and $.09 per share in fiscal 2002. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $68.9 million in fiscal 2004, $60.0 million in fiscal 2003, and $48.3 million in fiscal 2002. Financing activities also include proceeds of $59.2 million in fiscal 2004, $33.9 million in fiscal 2003, and $65.2 million in fiscal 2002 from the exercise of employee stock options. These stock option exercises also provided tax benefits of $13.6 million in fiscal 2004, $11.8 million in fiscal 2003, and $30.6 million in fiscal 2002. These benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. During fiscal 2003, we entered into a $370 million five year revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2004 we renewed our 364 day revolving credit facility for $330 million. Effective March 19, 2004, the 364 day agreement was renewed, with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged. The credit facilities do not require any compensating balances, however TJX must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Based on our current financial condition, we believe that the possibility of non compliance with these covenants is remote. The revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 31, 2004, there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $27 million during fiscal 2004 and $39 million during fiscal 2002. There were no short term borrowings during fiscal 2003. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short term borrowings was 1.09% in fiscal 2004 and 5.32% in fiscal 2002. As of January 31, 2004, we had credit lines totaling C$20 million for our Canadian subsidiary. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line was C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004, C$19.2 million in fiscal 2003 and C$22.6 million in fiscal 2002. The funding requirements of our Canadian operations were largely provided by TJX. We believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs. See Notes C and G to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt, capital stock transactions and available financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 31, 2004, we have payments due (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Less More Than 1 1 3 3 5 Than 5 Total Year Years Years Years Long Term Contractual Obligations Long term debt obligations $ 672,893 $ 5,000 $ 99,981 $ 368,287 $ 199,625 Operating lease commitments 4,314,225 639,669 1,156,120 966,623 1,551,813 Capital lease obligations 45,300 3,726 7,452 7,452 26,670 Purchase obligations 1,620,526 1,598,587 19,926 1,963 50 $ 6,652,944 $ 2,246,982 $ 1,283,479 $ 1,344,325 $ 1,778,158 The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. 23 Table of Contents Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates. Included in long term liabilities is $106 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years and $78 million for our rental step up accrual, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. Our long term liabilities also include our discontinued operations reserve of $17.5 million. We expect a large portion of this reserve will be paid in the next five years as settlements are reached, while a smaller portion will extend beyond five years for those reserve obligations tied to the remaining lease term. Critical Accounting Policies We have the obligation to evaluate and select applicable accounting policies for TJX. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, accounting for taxes and reserves for discontinued operations. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the first in first out retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the first in first out retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bobs Stores, the value oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements will likely have some impact on Bobs Stores inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results for fiscal 2004. Over time, we have found that actual results involving inventory valuation issues have not varied significantly from our estimates. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent an obligation that will ultimately be settled far in the future and is therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 have been considerably less than our expected returns. These two situations have resulted in a considerable increase in the annual cost of retirement benefits and have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $122.3 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. In addition, 24 Table of Contents during fiscal 2003, we reduced the assumption for the long term rate of return on pension plan assets to 8% from 9% which increased net pension expense for fiscal 2003 by approximately $2 million. Accounting for taxes: We are continuously under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. Reserves for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the managements discussion and analysis, we have reserves established for leases relating to operations discontinued by TJX where TJX was the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties. These are long term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate cost we will incur. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (Interpretation No. 46). In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen. Interpretation No. 46, as revised, provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities (VIEs)and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. Interpretation No. 46 was effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. We adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 46, as revised, as of January 31, 2004. The adoption of this Interpretation had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The provisions of this Statement are effective for all derivatives and hedging activity entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of this Statement are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The revised Statement requires some additional annual disclosures and makes certain disclosures required for interim reporting. The additional disclosures required annually are included in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. Some of the disclosure requirements of the revised SFAS No. 132 related to foreign plans, interim periods and certain other matters are not effective until fiscal 2005. 25 Table of Contents On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff Position No. SFAS 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 which addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 enacted on December 8, 2003. Specific guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and we will assess the impact of such guidance when it is issued. Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment, intercompany transactions and certain merchandise purchase commitments in these operations with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Note D to the consolidated financial statements, on page F 16, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment and certain merchandise commitments in these operations with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures, most of which are recorded directly in shareholders equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing, however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
