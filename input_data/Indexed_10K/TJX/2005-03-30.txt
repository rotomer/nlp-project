ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1 of this report under the section entitled Safe Harbor Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: Our financial performance for the 52 week fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005) as compared to our 53 week fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) is summarized below. Net sales for fiscal 2005 were $14.9 billion, a 12% increase over the 53 week fiscal period last year. Driven by a 4% same store sales increase at Marmaxx, our internal combination of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, consolidated same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2005 over the prior year on a comparable 52 to 52 week basis, with approximately 11/2 percentage points of this increase coming from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates of our Winners and T.K. Maxx businesses. We increased our number of stores by 8% in fiscal 2005 ending the fiscal year with 2,224 stores in operation. Selling square footage also grew by 8% in fiscal 2005. Net income for fiscal 2005 was $664.1 million compared to $658.4 million in the 53 week period last year. Fiscal 2005 net income reflects the impact of a fourth quarter, one time, non cash, after tax charge of $19.3 million, or $.04 per share, relating to lease accounting (see Note A to the consolidated financial statements) while fiscal 2004 includes the benefit of the 53rd week, estimated at $24.0 million (after tax), or $.05 per share. Excluding these items, net income would be $683.4 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to $634.4 million in fiscal 2004, an 8% increase. We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying earnings trends in our business. Diluted earnings per share was $1.30 in fiscal 2005 as compared to $1.25 per share in the prior year. Excluding the items noted above, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.34 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.20 in fiscal 2004, or an increase of 12%. We believe this presentation reflects our earnings per share on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying earnings trends in our business. Our reported operating results led to an after tax return on average shareholders equity of 41% for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. Our pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) declined from 8.0% in fiscal 2004 to 7.2% in fiscal 2005. The decline was driven by cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, which increased .7% as a percent of sales over last year, with the cumulative charge for the adjustment of our lease accounting practices amounting to .2% of this increase. In addition, .2% of the increase was due to the favorable impact of the 53rd week on the prior years cost of sales ratio. Selling, general and administrative costs were up .1% as a percent of sales in fiscal 2005 over the prior year. We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 25.1 million of our shares at a cost of $588 million. Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers were up 1% at the end of fiscal 2005 as compared to the prior year end period. Our liquid inventory position enhances our ability to take advantage of buying opportunities in the marketplace. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated and diluted earnings per share for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the new accounting rules relating to our contingently convertible debt. See Note A to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for TJX for our fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 totaled $14.9 billion, an 11.9% increase over sales of $13.3 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004. Our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2005 and the fiscal year ended January 25, 2003 (fiscal 2003). The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added incremental 14 Table of Contents sales of approximately $200 million, as compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003. The net sales for fiscal 2004 of $13.3 billion represented an 11.2% increase over sales of $12.0 billion for our fiscal year ended January 25, 2003. The 12% increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004, reflects approximately 6% from new stores, 5% from same store sales growth and 2% from the acquisition of Bobs Stores, partially offset by approximately a 1% reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less week than fiscal 2004. Bobs Stores was acquired on December 24, 2003 and our sales results for fiscal 2004 include Bobs Stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal 2005. The 11% increase in net sales for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 includes approximately 8% from new stores, 1% from same store sales growth, with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week. Sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. New stores are our major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 7.9% in fiscal 2005 and 10.2% in fiscal 2004 over the respective prior year period. Our selling square footage increased by 8.2% in fiscal 2005 and 9.6% in fiscal 2004, in each case over the prior year. Bobs Stores is excluded from fiscal 2004 store count and selling square footage calculations, as it was acquired late in fiscal 2004. Our acquisition of Bobs Stores on December 24, 2003, added 31 units as of the end of fiscal 2004. Net sales for Bobs Stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition. We expect to add 161 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006), a 7% projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 8%. Net sales for fiscal 2005 reflect strong demand for jewelry and accessories, womens apparel and footwear, partially offset by weaker demand for mens apparel and home fashions. The 5% growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal 2005 over the prior year was driven by a 4% same store sales increase at Marmaxx. Marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments. These initiatives were significant factors in Marmaxx achieving a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005. Consolidated same store sales growth of 1% in fiscal 2004 reflects the impact of unseasonable weather in the first half of that year. Same store sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 benefited by approximately 11/2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions, because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 76.3 75.6 75.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.3 16.2 16.2 Interest expense, net .2 .2 .2 Income before provision for income taxes 7.2 % 8.0 % 7.8 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 76.3% in fiscal 2005, 75.6% in fiscal 2004 and 75.8% in fiscal 2003. Our consolidated merchandise margin was essentially flat to the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2005, the Marmaxx division continued to effectively execute our merchandising and inventory management strategies, maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need, all of which led to improved 15 Table of Contents merchandise margin at this division. However, this improved merchandise margin at Marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions, most of which experienced higher markdowns. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 includes a .2% increase due to a $30.7 million non cash charge ($19.3 million after tax) to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Lease Accounting. This ratio in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, also reflects an increase of approximately .2% due to the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal 2004. The balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin, primarily in the second half of fiscal 2004. The improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate .6% reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio. Successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement. The contribution from improved merchandise margin was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lower than planned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs, as a result of opening our new T.J. Maxx distribution facility in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .3% for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by .1%. The cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period, estimated to be a .2% improvement in this ratio, as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.3% in fiscal 2005 and 16.2% in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a .1% increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of Bobs Stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results. Bobs Stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our off price divisions. In comparing fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003, store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased as a result of the delevering impact of less than planned sales, but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a pre tax $16 million litigation charge. The litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four California lawsuits that alleged TJX had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from California overtime laws. The lawsuits were settled in fiscal 2004 for slightly less than $16 million. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $25.8 million in fiscal 2005, $27.3 million in fiscal 2004 and $25.4 million in fiscal 2003. Interest income was $7.7 million in fiscal 2005, $6.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $10.5 million in fiscal 2003. The reduction in interest income in fiscal 2005 and 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.5% in fiscal 2005, 38.4% in fiscal 2004 and 38.3% in fiscal 2003. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and the increase in this rate in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 were primarily due to increases in state income tax rates. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 also reflects the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of split dollar arrangements as described in Note I to the consolidated financial statements. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) enacted on October 22, 2004 will allow companies to repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings of their foreign operations in fiscal 2006 at an effective rate of 5.25%. The Company is evaluating the impact of the act on TJX. Net income: Net income was $664.1 million in fiscal 2005, $658.4 million in fiscal 2004 and $578.4 million in fiscal 2003. Net income per share was $1.30 in fiscal 2005, $1.25 in fiscal 2004 and $1.05 in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of retroactive implementation of a new accounting pronouncement that requires the inclusion of shares associated with contingently convertible debt in the calculation of diluted earnings per share even if the contingencies have not been met. This accounting change had an adverse effect of $.04 on our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005 and $.03 on previously reported diluted earnings per share in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Net income for fiscal 2005 includes the after tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative pre tax charge associated with our lease accounting practices, which reduced net income in fiscal 2005 by $19.3 million, or $.04 per share. We estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added approximately $24 million to net income and $.05 to our 16 Table of Contents earnings per share, and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to our earnings per share in each year. The increase in earnings per share, on a percentage basis in all periods, increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2005 we repurchased 25.1 million shares of our stock at a cost of $588 million and we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2006 with planned purchases of approximately $600 million. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense and interest expense, net. Segment profit or loss, as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to income before provision for income taxes can be found in Note N to the consolidated financial statements. Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segments share of the cumulative pre tax charge relating to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Lease Accounting. MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 10,489.5 $ 9,937.2 $ 9,485.6 Segment profit $ 1,023.5 $ 961.6 $ 887.9 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.8 % 9.7 % 9.4 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 4 % (1 )% 2 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,468 1,418 1,342 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 35,544 34,101 32,271 Marmaxx posted a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005, compared to a 1% decrease in same store sales for fiscal 2004. Same store sales growth was driven by strong sales in the jewelry, accessories and footwear categories, as well as womens sportswear, with fashion trends in these categories helping to drive customer demand. Sales for mens apparel and home fashions in fiscal 2005 were soft. Same store sales benefited from the continuation of the Marmaxx program whereby certain departments in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores were expanded. Marmaxx ended fiscal 2005 with 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to 5 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 5 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal 2004. These initiatives drove overall sales in the stores with the expanded departments in addition to increasing sales in these categories and were significant factors in Marmaxx achieving a 4% same stores sales increase in fiscal 2005. Segment profit increased to 9.8% in fiscal 2005 from 9.7% in fiscal 2004, despite the impact of a $16.8 million charge for its share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The lease accounting charge reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by .2%. Marmaxx continued to effectively execute its merchandising and inventory strategies, aggressively managing the liquidity of its inventory and buying and shipping goods close to need, all of which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins. For fiscal 2005, merchandise margins increased .4%. Marmaxx also continued to effectively manage expenses in fiscal 2005. These improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of .3% as a percentage of sales, .2% of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge. Segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is also impacted by the benefit of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period described below. The increase in segment profit and profit margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 reflects Marmaxxs sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense controls in fiscal 2004. Marmaxx was able to buy closer to need in fiscal 2004, leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin, especially in the second half of the year. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated favorable impact of .2% on the segment profit margin for that year, as the sales volume from this 17 Table of Contents extra week helped lever certain fixed costs. The increase in segment profit and segment profit margin in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 also reflect the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to the $16 million litigation charge discussed above. We added a net of 50 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2005 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4%. We expect to open a net of 47 new stores in fiscal 2006, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and to increase the selling square footage of the division by 4%. We plan to add expanded jewelry and accessories departments in approximately 267 existing T.J. Maxx stores as well as all new T.J. Maxx stores and to add approximately 56 expanded footwear departments in existing and new Marshalls stores. WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,285.4 $ 1,076.3 $ 793.2 Segment profit $ 108.9 $ 106.7 $ 85.3 Segment profit as % of net sales 8.5 % 9.9 % 10.8 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 10 % 19 % 5 % Local currency 4 % 4 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 168 160 146 HomeSense 40 25 15 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 3,811 3,576 3,261 HomeSense 747 468 282 Same store sales (in local currency) for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, increased by 4% in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a $3.5 million charge for this divisions share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The growth in the Winners segment profit in fiscal 2005 over the prior year was due to favorable currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 of 8.5% was 1.4% below fiscal 2004 segment profit margin, primarily due to lower merchandise margins, which decreased .9% from the prior year, primarily driven by markdowns. Sales in the second half of fiscal 2005 slowed considerably from the first half, primarily due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment. This, along with Winners buying based on the strength of its first half sales, resulted in excess inventories, requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year. The lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by .2% with the balance of the segment profit margin reduction coming largely from the increasing impact of HomeSense on the divisions combined results. HomeSense is at an earlier stage of development and therefore operates with higher expense ratios than does Winners. Winners and HomeSense segment profit in fiscal 2004 increased 25% over the segment profit in fiscal 2003. Approximately two thirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Winners and HomeSense segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was below that of fiscal 2003. This reduction reflects increased markdowns at Winners and the increasing impact of HomeSense on their combined results. We opened 8 Winners stores and 15 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2005, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 13%. We expect to add a net of 4 Winners and 17 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2006, increasing our total Canadian store base by 10%, and increasing selling square footage by 10%. The store counts include the Winners portion and HomeSense portion of this divisions superstores which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side by side. As of January 29, 2005 we operated 11 superstores and expect to have a total of 23 superstores at the end of fiscal 2006. 18 Table of Contents T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,304.4 $ 992.2 $ 720.1 Segment profit $ 70.7 $ 59.1 $ 43.0 Segment profit as % of net sales 5.4 % 6.0 % 6.0 % Percent increase in same store sales U.S. currency 14 % 16 % 11 % Local currency 3 % 6 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period 170 147 123 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 3,491 2,841 2,282 T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland had a same store sales increase of 3% (in local currency) in fiscal 2005 on top of a 6% increase in fiscal 2004. T.K. Maxxs same store sales in fiscal 2005 were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year. In light of the retail environment under which T.K. Maxx operated in fiscal 2005, this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a $6.5 million charge for T.K. Maxxs share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The significant growth in T.K. Maxxs segment profit in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin in fiscal 2005 decreased .6% to 5.4%, primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of .7% as a percentage of sales, of which .5% was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge. Segment profit for fiscal 2004 increased 37% over the segment profit for fiscal 2003 with approximately one quarter of this growth coming from currency exchange rates. The strong segment performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by T.K. Maxxs strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies. We added 23 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2005, and increased the divisions selling square footage by 23%. Selling square footage was favorably impacted by the addition of mezzanines in some of our existing stores. We plan to open an additional 23 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2006, and expand selling square footage by 20%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,012.9 $ 876.5 $ 705.1 Segment profit $ 23.1 $ 49.8 $ 32.1 Segment profit as % of net sales 2.3 % 5.7 % 4.6 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 1 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period 216 182 142 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,159 3,548 2,830 HomeGoods same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2005, compared to a 1% increase in fiscal 2004. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a $2.2 million charge for HomeGoods share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. HomeGoods segment profit declined from $49.8 million in fiscal 2004 to $23.1 million in fiscal 2005. The business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix, which led to a modest 1% same store sales increase. Consequently, the division took additional markdowns, which contributed to a 1.8% reduction in its merchandise margin. The decline in segment profit margin from 5.7% in fiscal 2004 to 2.3% in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin. Segment profit margin was also impacted by a .9% increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales (including .2% due to the lease accounting charge) and a .7% increase in distribution center 19 Table of Contents costs as a percentage of net sales. These expense ratio increases reflect the negative impact on expense ratios of a 1% same store sales increase. In fiscal 2004, segment profit increased 55% over the segment profit of fiscal 2003 despite only a modest 1% increase in same store sales in fiscal 2004. HomeGoods segment profit margin reflected the solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies in fiscal 2004, and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as the business expanded over fiscal 2003. We opened a net of 34 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2005, a 19% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 17%. In fiscal 2006, we plan to add a net of 40 new HomeGoods stores (including freestanding and superstore formats) and increase selling square footage by 19%. A.J. WRIGHT: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 530.6 $ 421.6 $ 277.2 Segment (loss) profit $ (15.0 ) $ 1.7 $ (12.6 ) Segment (loss) profit as % of net sales (2.8 )% .4 % (4.5 )% Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 8 % 11 % Stores in operation at end of period 130 99 75 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,606 1,967 1,498 A.J. Wrights same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2005 compared to an 8% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2004. Segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a $1.7 million charge for A.J. Wrights share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. We believe that the A.J. Wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors, such as higher energy costs, and that this had an impact on the divisions sales performance in fiscal 2005. We also believe that a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales during the year. These sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 reflects a reduction in merchandise margins of 1.2%, primarily due to this higher markdown activity. We believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005, especially later in the year, may have been too aggressive for this young division, and placed a strain on operations. In addition, the lower than planned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs, distribution center costs and store payroll. Distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to A.J. Wrights new distribution facility in Indiana. In fiscal 2004, the improvement in A.J. Wrights segment profit, as compared to fiscal 2003, was primarily due to the impact of improved merchandising and strong inventory management, which led to improved merchandise margins. Segment profit for fiscal 2004 also included a $1.7 million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property. We added 31 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2005, increasing selling square footage by 32%. In fiscal 2006, we plan to add 25 new stores and increase selling square footage by 20%. BOBS STORES: Fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for Bobs Stores as a TJX division. Bobs Stores now operates 32 stores and recorded fiscal 2005 sales of $290.6 million and a segment loss of $17.3 million. In fiscal 2005, we built the Bobs Stores organization and we continued to refine the concept, including repositioning the divisions promotional activity, improving its inventory management, fine tuning its product assortment and testing a smaller store size. For fiscal 2006, we plan to open 5 Bobs Stores and increase selling square footage by 15%. 20 Table of Contents GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2005 2004 2003 (53 weeks) General corporate expense $ 88.5 $ 78.4 $ 72.8 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the non divisional departments for accounting and budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses, the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in general corporate overhead, incremental audit fees and costs related to the start up of our e commerce businesses. This increase was offset in part by a $6.3 million reduction in contributions to The TJX Foundation in fiscal 2005, compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of contributions to The TJX Foundation of $9.8 million in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, there were no contributions to The TJX Foundation. This increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity. The majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity. The changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings. In fiscal 2003 and for the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the realized gains or losses on these contracts were allocated to the appropriate division at the time the contracts were settled. Effective with the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2004 we began including the unrealized values of these contracts within the individual segments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,079.8 million in fiscal 2005, $770.5 million in fiscal 2004, and $908.6 million in fiscal 2003. The cash generated from operating activities each of these fiscal years is largely due to strong operating earnings. The difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year is largely driven by the change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year end levels. In fiscal 2005 this change in net inventory position resulted in a use of cash of $85.3 million compared to $191.8 million in fiscal 2004 and $40.1 million in fiscal 2003. Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, at January 29, 2005 increased only 1% compared to the prior year, whereas inventories per store at January 31, 2004 were up 11% compared to the prior year. This change in net inventory position and the trend in inventory levels per store reflect our decision to raise the level of store inventories in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 levels and to maintain them at fiscal 2004 levels in fiscal 2005. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. This accrual as of January 29, 2005 increased both inventory and accounts payable by $237 million and thus had no impact on cash flow from operations. The cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2005 were also impacted by a larger increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities than in fiscal 2004, reflecting increased accruals at the end of fiscal 2005 for rent and landlord allowances, property additions, gift cards and payroll. The cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2004 were impacted by a smaller increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities at the end of fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, reflecting reduced accruals for property additions and the payment of the California lawsuits in fiscal 2004. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities also reflects cash expenditures of $7.1 million in fiscal 2005, $37.2 million in fiscal 2004, and $32.2 million in fiscal 2003 charged against our discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below. 21 Table of Contents Operating cash flows in fiscal 2005, and to a greater extent in fiscal 2004, were favorably affected by deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for U.S. income tax purposes. Cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of $25.0 million in fiscal 2005, $17.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $58.0 million in fiscal 2003. All of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were made on a voluntary basis. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former TJX businesses that have been sold or spun off. The reserve reflects TJXs estimation of its cost for claims that have been, or are likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases when the assignees of the leases filed for bankruptcy, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 29, 2005, substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in the bankruptcies and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved. It is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or have not expired. We do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve. The reserve balance amounted to $12.4 million as of January 29, 2005 and $17.5 million as of January 31, 2004. We may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of BJs Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which BJs Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJs Wholesale Club. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJs Wholesale Club leases discussed in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $120 million as of January 29, 2005. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In Millions 2005 2004 New stores $ 162.6 $ 164.7 Store renovations and improvements 193.7 147.3 Office and distribution centers 72.8 97.0 Capital expenditures $ 429.1 $ 409.0 22 Table of Contents We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $530 million for fiscal 2006. This includes $168 million for new stores, $262 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $100 million for our office and distribution centers. Our planned rate of growth in selling square footage per year is approximately 8%, on a consolidated basis, for the next several years. Our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores, are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures. Investing activities for fiscal 2004 includes a net cash outflow of $57.1 million to acquire Bobs Stores as discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $587.6 million in fiscal 2005, $546.8 million in fiscal 2004, and $509.1 million in fiscal 2003. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $594.6 million in fiscal 2005, $520.7 million in fiscal 2004, and $481.7 million in fiscal 2003 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005, 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004, and 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2003. All shares repurchased were retired with the exception of 75,000 shares purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87,638 shares purchased in fiscal 2003, which are held in treasury. During May 2004, we completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common stock. Since the inception of the new $1 billion stock repurchase program, as of January 29, 2005, we have repurchased 17.7 million shares at a total cost of $406.6 million under this program. All of these repurchased share numbers reflect the two for one stock split distributed in May 2002. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of $5 million in fiscal 2005, and $15 million in fiscal 2004. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $.18 per share in fiscal 2005, $.14 per share in fiscal 2004, and $.12 per share in fiscal 2003. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $83.4 million in fiscal 2005, $68.9 million in fiscal 2004, and $60.0 million in fiscal 2003. Financing activities also include proceeds of $96.9 million in fiscal 2005, $59.2 million in fiscal 2004, and $33.9 million in fiscal 2003 from the exercise of employee stock options. These stock option exercises, along with vesting of restricted stock awards, also provided tax benefits of $20.9 million in fiscal 2005, $13.6 million in fiscal 2004, and $11.8 million in fiscal 2003. These tax benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. During fiscal 2003, we entered into a $370 million five year revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2005 we renewed our 364 day revolving credit facility for $330 million. Effective March 17, 2005, we extended the 364 day agreement until July 15, 2005, with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged. We anticipate that during the year we will negotiate new agreements increasing the aggregate size of our revolving credit facilities and extending their maturity. The credit facilities do not require any compensating balances, however, TJX must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Based on our current financial condition, we believe that non compliance with these covenants is remote. The revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 29, 2005 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $5 million during fiscal 2005 and $27 million during fiscal 2004. There were no short term borrowings during fiscal 2003. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short term borrowings was 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and 1.09% in fiscal 2004. As of January 29, 2005, we had credit lines totaling C$20 million for our Canadian subsidiary. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line was C$6.8 million during fiscal 2005, C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004, and C$19.2 million in fiscal 2003. The funding requirements of our Canadian operations were largely provided by TJX. We believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and available financing sources. 23 Table of Contents Contractual obligations: As of January 29, 2005, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Less More Than 1 1 3 3 5 Than 5 Long Term Contractual Obligations Total Year Years Years Years Long term debt obligations $ 675,439 $ 99,995 $ 375,755 $ 199,689 $ Operating lease commitments 4,840,640 707,676 1,310,903 1,112,675 1,709,386 Capital lease obligations 41,575 3,726 7,452 7,452 22,945 Purchase obligations 1,617,142 1,589,953 26,741 448 $ 7,174,796 $ 2,401,350 $ 1,720,851 $ 1,320,264 $ 1,732,331 The above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates. Included in other long term liabilities is $125.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years and $115.3 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, and accounting for taxes. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bobs Stores, the value oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain 24 Table of Contents conditions are met. These arrangements do have some impact on Bobs inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 were considerably less than our expected returns. These two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $100.5 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: The nature of our casualty insurance program for certain fiscal periods, primarily fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, carries a deductible that exposes TJX to losses for casualty claims in excess of our estimated annual cost of such losses. The accrual for our estimated losses requires us, with the aid of an actuarial service and based upon claims experience of TJX and other factors, to make significant estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A large portion of these losses are funded during the policy year, offsetting our estimated loss accruals. The Company has a net accrual of $26.4 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty losses as of January 29, 2005. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) which requires that the cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity based compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). This Statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005 (our third quarter of fiscal 2006). We disclose the pro forma impact of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 as originally issued in our notes to the consolidated financial statements and we are still assessing the impact that SFAS No. 123R will have on our financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these items to be recognized as current period charges. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This Statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. This Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have any material impact on our financial statements. 25 Table of Contents On January 12, 2004, the FASB released Staff Position No. SFAS 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 which addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to arise as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) enacted on December 8, 2003. We are in the process of determining if our plan is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and our disclosed postretirement medical cost of $6.7 million for fiscal 2005 has not been reduced by any federal subsidy. We do not expect that any subsidy for which we may qualify will be material. MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 29, 2005, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 29, 2005, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 26 Table of Contents
