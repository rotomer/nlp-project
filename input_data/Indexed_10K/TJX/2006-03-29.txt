ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this report under the section entitled Risk Factors. The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006), January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005) and January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 TJX elected to early adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (SFAS No. 123(R)), Share Based Payment. This standard requires that the fair value of all stock based awards be reflected in the financial statements based on the fair value of the award. TJX has elected the modified retrospective transition method and accordingly, all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this standard in those periods, based on the pro forma amounts as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2006 Overview: Net sales for fiscal 2006 were $16.1 billion, an 8% increase over fiscal 2005. Consolidated same store sales increased 2% in fiscal 2006 over the prior year, with approximately 1/2 percentage point of this increase coming from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates on our Winners and T.K. Maxx businesses. We increased our number of stores by 7% in fiscal 2006, ending the fiscal year with 2,381 stores in operation. Our selling square footage grew by 8% in fiscal 2006. Net income for fiscal 2006 was $690.4 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to $609.7 million, or $1.21 per share, last year. Both of these years include certain items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on net income and earnings per share. Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $s EPS $s EPS Net income as reported $ 690 $ 1.41 $ 610 $ 1.21 Adjusted for: Cumulative lease accounting charge 19 .04 Impact of deferred tax liability correction (22 ) (.04 ) Repatriation income tax benefit (47 ) (.10 ) Third quarter events * 12 .02 Net income as adjusted $ 633 $ 1.29 $ 629 $ 1.25 * The third quarter events include the cost of executive resignation agreements, e commerce exit costs and operating losses, and hurricane related costs including the estimated impact of lost sales, partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement. We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business. Our pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) declined from 6.6% in fiscal 2005 to 6.3% in fiscal 2006. The decline was primarily due to the de levering impact of low single digit same store sales on our expense ratios. Fourth quarter results for fiscal 2006 were stronger than earlier quarters, with same store sales that increased 3% and pre tax margins that grew from 6.1% last year to 7.5% this year. Approximately one half of the pre tax margin improvement was due to increased gross profit margins and expense leverage during the quarter, with the balance due to the impact on last years results of a one time charge related to lease accounting. We believe that changes initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 to improve execution of our off price strategies, particularly off price buying, contributed to our strong fourth quarter results. 15 Table of Contents We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 25.9 million of our shares at a cost of $600 million, which favorably affected our earnings per share. Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 11% at the end of fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year end period. This decline is largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). See Note A to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for fiscal 2006 totaled $16.1 billion, an 8% increase over net sales of $14.9 billion in fiscal 2005. Net sales for fiscal 2005 increased 12% over sales of $13.3 billion for fiscal 2004. Our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, which added incremental sales of approximately $200 million in fiscal 2004. The 8% increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 includes a 6% increase attributable to new stores and a 2% increase in same store sales. The 12% increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 reflects approximately 6% from new stores, 5% from same store sales growth and 2% from the acquisition of Bobs Stores, partially offset by approximately a 1% reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less week than fiscal 2004. Bobs Stores was acquired on December 24, 2003 and our sales results for fiscal 2004 include Bobs Stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006. New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 7.1% in fiscal 2006 and 7.8% in fiscal 2005 over the respective prior year period. Our selling square footage increased by 7.7% in fiscal 2006 and 8.2% in fiscal 2005. We expect to add 105 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), a 4% projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 5%. Same store sales for fiscal 2006 were driven by strong demand for jewelry, accessories, and footwear, which continued to generate significant increases on top of very strong results last year, as well as improved demand for mens apparel. The positive impact of growth in these categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and womens sportswear. Marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/ accessories departments and 146 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments. These stores had same store sales growth which exceeded Marmaxxs chain average. In the United States, where TJX generates approximately 80% of its sales, same store sales were strong in warm weather regions, particularly Florida, the Southwest and California, while flat to slightly negative in the Midwest and Northeast. Same store sales growth was positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately 1/2 a percentage point of growth. Net sales for fiscal 2005 reflected strong demand for jewelry and accessories, womens apparel and footwear, partially offset by weaker demand for mens apparel and home fashions. The 5% growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal 2005 over the prior year was driven by a 4% same store sales increase at Marmaxx, our largest division. Marmaxx ended the year with 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry/ accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments which were significant factors in Marmaxx achieving a 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2005. Same store sales growth in fiscal 2005 benefited by approximately 11/2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year on a comparable 52 week basis. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we 16 Table of Contents believe the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions, because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 76.6 76.4 75.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.9 16.8 16.6 Interest expense, net .2 .2 .2 Income before provision for income taxes 6.3 % 6.6 % 7.4 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 76.6% in fiscal 2006, 76.4% in fiscal 2005 and 75.8% in fiscal 2004. This ratio for fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of .5%. The improvement in merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions, partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs. In addition, the comparison to the fiscal 2005 expense ratio was favorably impacted by a $30.7 million non cash charge ($19.3 million after tax) in fiscal 2005 to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Lease Accounting. This charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and increased last years expense ratio by .2%. These improvements in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs, which reflect the de levering impact of a 2% same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 reflects consolidated merchandise margins that were essentially flat to the prior year. Throughout fiscal 2005, the Marmaxx division effectively executed its merchandising and inventory management strategies, maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need, all of which led to improved merchandise margin at this division. However, this improved merchandise margin at Marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions, most of which experienced higher markdowns. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 includes a .2% increase due to the lease accounting charge. This ratio in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, also reflects an increase of approximately .2% due to the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal 2004. The balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.9% in fiscal 2006, 16.8% in fiscal 2005 and 16.6% in fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2006 over the prior year is due to an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the de levering impact of the low single digit same store sales increase. The increase in this ratio was also negatively impacted by the net impact of third quarter events including the cost of the executive resignation agreements, e commerce exit and hurricane related costs, offset in part by the VISA/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a .1% increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of Bobs Stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results. Bobs Stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our off price divisions. In addition, the fiscal 2005 expense ratio compared to fiscal 2004 reflects an increase in stock based compensation. TJX has taken various actions to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 designed to improve profit margins. TJX also revised its approach to long term compensation in fiscal 2006 by substantially decreasing the number 17 Table of Contents of stock options issued and increasing the long term cash incentive award opportunities, which is designed to help control the long term portion of compensation costs going forward. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $29.6 million in fiscal 2006, $25.8 million in fiscal 2005, and $27.3 million in fiscal 2004. Interest income was $9.4 million in fiscal 2006, $7.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $6.5 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006 is due to higher short term borrowings and interest rates. The higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases, capital expenditures and repurchase of the Companys common stock. The additional interest expense from short term borrowings was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to the repayment of $100 million of 7% unsecured notes in June 2005, as well as an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates. The reduction in net interest expense in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income in fiscal 2005. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 31.6% in fiscal 2006, 38.3% in fiscal 2005 and 38.2% in fiscal 2004. The tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth quarter benefit of $47 million due to the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiary. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we corrected our accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans. We had previously established a deferred tax liability on these gains which are not taxable. The impact of correcting for the tax treatment of these gains results in a tax benefit of $22 million, or $.04 per share in fiscal 2006. The cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was $18.2 million, all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million, $10.1 million related to fiscal 2005. These two items collectively reduced the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8%. See Note H to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increases in state income tax rates. Net income: Net income was $690.4 million in fiscal 2006, $609.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $609.4 million in fiscal 2004. Net income per share was $1.41 in fiscal 2006, $1.21 in fiscal 2005 and $1.16 in fiscal 2004. Net income for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $47 million, or $.10 per share, due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of $22 million, or $.04 per share, relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. Net income for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately $12 million, or $.02 per share, due to the third quarter events. These third quarter events included the after tax cost of executive resignation agreements, primarily with respect to our former CEO ($5 million), e commerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million), and uninsured losses due to hurricanes in the third quarter, including the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million). Operating losses of the e commerce operation in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely offset by fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss in fiscal 2005. Net income for fiscal 2005 was reduced by $19.3 million, or $.04 per share, as a result of the after tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative pre tax, non cash charge associated with our lease accounting practices. In fiscal 2004, we estimate that the 53rd week added approximately $24 million to net income and $.05 to our earnings per share. Lastly, favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added approximately $.02 to our earnings per share in each year. The change in earnings per share from year to year was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2006 we repurchased 25.9 million shares of our stock at a cost of $600 million and in fiscal 2005 we repurchased 25.1 million shares at a cost of $588 million. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2007 with planned purchases of approximately $650 million. 18 Table of Contents Trends improved in the fourth quarter, with significant increases in net income and earnings per share compared to the prior year. Reported net income was $288.7 million, up 75% over the prior year, and earnings per share was $.60, up 82% over the prior year. Results for both of these years include certain items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter net income and earnings per share: Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $s EPS $s EPS Net income as reported $ 289 $ .60 $ 165 $ .33 Adjusted for: Cumulative lease accounting charge 19 .04 Impact of deferred tax liability correction (22 ) (.04 ) Repatriation income tax benefit (47 ) (.10 ) Net income as adjusted $ 220 $ .46 $ 184 $ .37 Excluding these one time items, fourth quarter net income was $220 million, up 19% and earnings per share was $.46, up 24%. Results were driven by same store sales growth of 3% as well as by decreases in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales. The reduction in the cost of sales ratio was due to improved merchandise margins, with reduced levels of markdowns at our Winners, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright divisions being the major factors. The reduction in the selling, general and administrative expense ratio was due to a decrease in store payroll and other store costs as a percentage of net sales. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense and interest expense, net. Segment profit or loss, as defined by TJX, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to income before provision for income taxes can be found in Note N to the consolidated financial statements. Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segments share of the cumulative pre tax charge relating to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Lease Accounting. Also, segment profit for the current year and all prior periods include the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Segment profit for fiscal 2006 was positively impacted by the strong fourth quarter, in which every division increased its segment profit, or decreased its segment loss, compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 10,956.8 $ 10,489.5 $ 9,937.2 Segment profit $ 985.4 $ 982.1 $ 922.9 Segment profit as % of net sales 9.0 % 9.4 % 9.3 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 2 % 4 % (1 )% Stores in operation at end of period 1,514 1,468 1,418 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 36,987 35,544 34,101 Marmaxx posted a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2006, compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005. Same store sales growth in fiscal 2006 was driven by strong sales in the jewelry, accessories and footwear categories, while same store sales for home fashions and womens sportswear were below the chain average. Same store sales in fiscal 2005 also reflected strong sales in the jewelry, accessories and footwear categories as well as womens sportswear. Same store sales in both years benefited from the continuation of the Marmaxx program whereby certain 19 Table of Contents departments in the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores were expanded. Marmaxx ended fiscal 2006 with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to 303 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 67 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal 2005. These initiatives were significant factors in Marmaxxs overall same store sales results, particularly in fiscal 2005 when sales in the stores with the expanded departments were above the chain average. Geographically in fiscal 2006, Florida, the Southwest and the West Coast all performed above the chain average, while the Northeast and the Midwest performed below the chain average. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (segment margin) decreased to 9.0% in fiscal 2006 from 9.4% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was largely driven by the de levering impact of a 2% same store sales increase, which impacted operating expense ratios, primarily occupancy costs (which increased .3% as a percentage of sales) and distribution center costs (which increased .1% as a percentage of sales). In addition, the certain third quarter events described earlier (e commerce and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the VISA/ MasterCard settlement) reduced segment margin in fiscal 2006 by .1%. The comparison to the fiscal 2005 margin is favorably impacted by the inclusion in last years segment profit of a $16.8 million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment, which reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by .2%. Merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related increases in freight costs. As of January 28, 2006, average inventories per store were down 10% compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced inventory levels on hand at the distribution centers. Segment margin increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 despite the impact of the lease accounting charge described above. In fiscal 2005, Marmaxx executed its merchandising and inventory strategies effectively, which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins which increased .4%. Marmaxx also effectively managed expenses in fiscal 2005. These improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of .3% as a percentage of sales, .2% of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge. Segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 are also impacted by the benefit of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period. The 53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated favorable impact of .2% on the segment profit margin for that year, as the sales volume from this extra week helped to lever certain fixed costs. We added a net of 46 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2006 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4%. We expect to open 50 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2007, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 4%. We plan to add approximately 99 expanded jewelry and accessories departments in existing and new T.J. Maxx stores and to add approximately 130 expanded footwear departments in existing and new Marshalls stores. WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,457.7 $ 1,285.4 $ 1,076.3 Segment profit $ 120.3 $ 99.7 $ 98.9 Segment profit as % of net sales 8.3 % 7.8 % 9.2 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 4 % 10 % 19 % Local currency (3 )% 4 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 174 168 160 HomeSense 58 40 25 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,012 3,811 3,576 HomeSense 1,100 747 468 Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, for fiscal 2006 increased by 13% over fiscal 2005, with approximately half of this growth due to currency exchange rates. Same store sales (in local currency) decreased by 3% in fiscal 2006 and increased by 4% in fiscal 2005. Same store sales for fiscal 2006 were adversely impacted by a decline 20 Table of Contents in the average unit selling price. Same store sales were also impacted by lower clearance sales volume, primarily in the second half of the year, as Winners per store inventories were significantly below the prior year due to improved inventory management. At the end of fiscal 2006, average per store inventories were down 6% compared to the prior year. Same store sales were also negatively impacted by declines in the womens sportswear and home fashion categories. Segment profit margin improved by .5% compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily due to a 2.9% increase in merchandise margins which were driven by improved inventory management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower markdowns. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the de levering impact of the 3% decline in same store sales. Expense ratios increased across most categories, with a 1.4% increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most significant. Incremental costs associated with three store closings in fiscal 2006 also impacted segment profit. The comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a $3.5 million charge for this divisions share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The growth in Winners segment profit in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was due to favorable currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 of 7.8% was 1.4% below fiscal 2004, primarily due to lower merchandise margins, which decreased .9% from the prior year, primarily driven by markdowns. Sales in the second half of fiscal 2005 slowed considerably from the first half, due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment. This, combined with Winners aggressive buying based on the strength of its first half sales, resulted in excess inventories, requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year, negatively impacting segment profit margin. The lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by .2% in fiscal 2005. The change in segment profit margin for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by the growth of the Companys HomeSense business, which is at an earlier stage of development than the core Winners business and therefore operates with higher expense ratios. We added a net of 6 Winners stores and 18 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2006, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 12%. We expect to add a net of 11 Winners and 10 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2007, increasing our total Canadian store base by 9%, and increasing selling square footage by 8%. The store counts include the Winners portion and HomeSense portion of this divisions superstores which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side by side. As of January 28, 2006, we operated 22 of these superstores and expect to have a total of 29 superstores at the end of fiscal 2007. T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,517.1 $ 1,304.4 $ 992.2 Segment profit $ 69.2 $ 64.0 $ 53.7 Segment profit as % of net sales 4.6 % 4.9 % 5.4 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency (1 )% 14 % 16 % Local currency 1 % 3 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period 197 170 147 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,216 3,491 2,841 Net sales in fiscal 2006 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, increased by 16% over fiscal 2005. T.K. Maxx had a same store sales increase of 1% (in local currency) in fiscal 2006 on top of a 3% increase in fiscal 2005. T.K. Maxxs same store sales in fiscal 2006 were negatively impacted by a weak retail environment in the United Kingdom, as well as unseasonably warm weather early in the year. Womens sportswear and footwear categories were below the chain average, while sales of home fashions were strong. Segment profit margin declined .3% to 4.6% of sales. T.K. Maxx had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006, primarily due to lower markdowns. In addition, the comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of this divisions share of the 21 Table of Contents cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of $6.5 million. These improvements however, were more than offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost for rent, utilities and property taxes as well as the de levering impact of a 1% same store sales increase. Distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005, despite the low same store sales increase. T.K. Maxxs operating results for fiscal 2005 were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year. In light of the retail environment under which T.K. Maxx operated in fiscal 2005, this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins. Segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2005 include a $6.5 million charge for T.K. Maxxs share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. The significant growth in T.K. Maxxs segment profit in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates. The segment profit margin in fiscal 2005 decreased .5% to 4.9%, primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of .7% as a percentage of sales, of which .5% was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge. We added 27 new T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2006 and increased the divisions selling square footage by 21%. We plan to open an additional 15 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2007, and expand selling square footage by 10%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 1,186.9 $ 1,012.9 $ 876.5 Segment profit $ 28.4 $ 18.1 $ 45.4 Segment profit as % of net sales 2.4 % 1.8 % 5.2 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 1 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 251 216 182 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,859 4,159 3,548 HomeGoods same store sales grew 1% in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Customer transactions and unit sales increased at HomeGoods during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, but these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise mix. Segment profit increased to $28.4 million from $18.1 million and segment profit margin increased to 2.4% of sales from 1.8% of sales in the prior year. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in merchandise margin (lower markdowns partially offset by the impact of higher freight costs), as well as the impact on prior year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of $2.2 million. HomeGoods fourth quarter same store sales and operating results were particularly strong. The strength of HomeGoods fourth quarter more than offset unfavorable factors to segment profit and margin for fiscal 2006, including the de levering impact of the 1% same store sales increase, e commerce operating loss of $3.7 million and approximately $2 million of costs related to the planned closing of a distribution center. Segment profit in fiscal 2005 declined to $18.1 million from $45.4 million in the prior year. The business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix, which led to a 1% same store sales increase. The business also took additional markdowns, which led to a reduction in its merchandise margin. The decline in segment profit margin from 5.2% in fiscal 2004 to 1.8% in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin. Segment profit in fiscal 2005 also included a charge for $2.2 million for HomeGoods share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. Segment profit margin was also impacted by increases in occupancy costs and distribution center costs as a percentage of net sales. These expense ratio increases reflect the de levering impact on expense ratios of a 1% same store sales increase. We opened a net of 35 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2006, a 16% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 17%. In fiscal 2007, we plan to add a net of 10 HomeGoods stores (15 new less 5 closings) and increase selling square footage by 5%, reflecting our plan to slow the pace of store openings for this division. 22 Table of Contents A.J. WRIGHT: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) Net sales $ 651.0 $ 530.6 $ 421.6 Segment (loss) $ (2.2 ) $ (19.6 ) $ (2.1 ) Segment (loss) as % of net sales (0.3 )% (3.7 )% (0.5 )% Percent increase in same store sales 3 % 4 % 8 % Stores in operation at end of period 152 130 99 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 3,054 2,606 1,967 A.J. Wrights same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2006 compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005. A.J. Wrights segment loss for fiscal 2006 was narrowed to $2.2 million from $19.6 million in fiscal 2005. This improvement was driven by improved merchandise margin, primarily the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006. The comparison to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion of a $1.7 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of the lease accounting adjustment. In fiscal 2006, effective expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales across most expense categories, primarily in advertising and store payroll and benefits. We reduced the number of our new store openings for A.J. Wright in fiscal 2006 as we believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too aggressive for this young division, placing a strain on operations. A.J. Wrights segment loss grew to $19.6 million in fiscal 2005 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2004. We believe that the A.J. Wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors, such as higher energy costs, and that such factors along with a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales in fiscal 2005. These sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 reflected a reduction in merchandise margins of 1.2%, primarily due to this higher markdown activity. In addition, the lower than planned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs, distribution center costs and store payroll. Distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to A.J. Wrights new distribution facility in Indiana. Segment loss for fiscal 2005 also included a $1.7 million charge for A.J. Wrights share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. We added 22 new A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2006, increasing selling square footage by 17%. In fiscal 2007, we plan to add a net of 8 new stores (10 new stores less 2 closings) and increase selling square footage by 5%, reflecting our plan to slow the pace of new store openings. BOBS STORES: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 Net sales $ 288.5 $ 290.6 Segment (loss) $ (28.0 ) $ (18.5 ) Segment (loss) as % of net sales (9.7 )% (6.4 )% Stores in operation at end of period 35 32 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 1,276 1,166 Fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for Bobs Stores as a TJX division. Bobs Stores operated 35 stores as of the end of fiscal 2006. Net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional advertising circulars. Although merchandise margin improved in fiscal 2006 (due to lower promotional markdowns), the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Segment loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs of $0.8 million in connection with a reduction in the work force at Bobs Stores. For fiscal 2007, we plan to open 1 Bobs store. We are in the process of implementing new strategies for Bobs with the goal of reducing its segment loss in fiscal 2007. 23 Table of Contents GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2006 2005 2004 (53 weeks) General corporate expense $ 134.1 $ 111.1 $ 99.7 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with executive resignation agreements ($9 million) and of exiting the e commerce business of ($6 million). Both of these items occurred in our third quarter period ended October 29, 2005. In addition, general corporate expense includes a charge ($4 million) in connection with an idle leased facility. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses, the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in general corporate overhead, incremental audit fees and costs related to the start up of our e commerce businesses. This increase was offset in part by a $6.3 million reduction in contributions to The TJX Foundation in fiscal 2005, compared to fiscal 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006, $1,076.8 million in fiscal 2005, and $767.9 million in fiscal 2004. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Net income adjusted for non cash items was essentially the same in each year. The difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year was largely driven by the change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year end levels. In fiscal 2006 this change in net inventory position resulted in a source of cash of $26.2 million compared to a use of cash of $85.3 million in fiscal 2005 and $191.8 million in fiscal 2004. This trend is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period. Average per store inventories at January 28, 2006, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, decreased 11% compared to the prior year and at January 29, 2005 they increased 1% compared to the prior year. This compares to inventories per store at January 31, 2004 that were up 11% compared to the prior year. Effective with the third quarter ended October 30, 2004, we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by TJX. This accrual increased inventory by $341 million as of January 28, 2006 and by $237 million as of January 29, 2005 along with a comparable increase to our accounts payable, and thus had no impact on cash flows from operations. The cash flows from operating activities for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were also impacted by increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities in each year. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased in each year in part due to higher liabilities for rent, gift cards and payroll and benefits. In addition, fiscal 2005 was impacted by an increase in deferred landlord allowances. Cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of $40 million in fiscal 2006, $25.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $17.5 million in fiscal 2004. All of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were made on a voluntary basis. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former TJX businesses. The reserve reflects TJXs estimation of its cost for claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or are likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of 24 Table of Contents the leases of these businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 28, 2006, substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved. Although TJXs actual costs with respect to any of these leases may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or had not expired, TJX does not expect to incur any material costs related to discontinued operations in excess of the reserve. The reserve balance amounted to $15.0 million as of January 28, 2006, $12.4 million as of January 29, 2005 and $17.5 million as of January 31, 2004. During fiscal 2006, TJX received creditor recoveries of $8.5 million, offset by equivalent additions to the reserve to reflect adjustments to the reserve during the year. Any additional creditor recoveries are expected to be immaterial. We may also be contingently liable on up to 18 leases of BJs Wholesale Club, another former TJX business, for which BJs Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJs Wholesale Club. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJs Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $100 million as of January 28, 2006. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In Millions 2006 2005 New stores $ 171.9 $ 162.6 Store renovations and improvements 267.1 193.7 Office and distribution centers 56.9 72.8 Capital expenditures $ 495.9 $ 429.1 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $395 million for fiscal 2007. This includes $115 million for new stores, $226 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $54 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer new store openings, primarily at HomeGoods, A.J. Wright and T.K. Maxx, as well as lower capital spending across most other areas of our business. 25 Table of Contents Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $503.7 million in fiscal 2006, $584.6 million in fiscal 2005, and $544.3 million in fiscal 2004. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $603.7 million in fiscal 2006, $594.6 million in fiscal 2005, and $520.7 million in fiscal 2004 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006, 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005, and 26.8 million shares in fiscal 2004. All shares repurchased were retired. During fiscal 2006, we completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional $1 billion of common stock. Under the new $1 billion stock repurchase program, we repurchased 0.3 million shares at a total cost of $6.6 million through January 28, 2006. In January 2006, Winners entered into a C$235 million (US$204.4) non revolving term credit facility, due in January 2009 and guaranteed by TJX. Interest is payable at rates equal to, or less than the Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively establishes a fixed rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of Winners earnings to TJX as well as other general corporate purposes of this division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006, $5 million in fiscal 2005, and $15 million in fiscal 2004. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $.24 per share in fiscal 2006, $.18 per share in fiscal 2005, and $.14 per share in fiscal 2004. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $105.3 million in fiscal 2006, $83.4 million in fiscal 2005, and $68.9 million in fiscal 2004. Financing activities also include proceeds of $102.4 million in fiscal 2006, $96.9 million in fiscal 2005, and $59.2 million in fiscal 2004 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. In May 2005, we entered into a $500 million four year revolving credit facility and a $500 million five year revolving credit facility. These arrangements replaced our $370 million five year revolving credit facility entered into in March 2002 and our $330 million 364 day revolving credit facility, which had been extended through July 15, 2005. The new agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program. As of January 28, 2006 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $567 million during fiscal 2006, $5 million during fiscal 2005 and $27 million during fiscal 2004. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short term borrowings was 3.69% in fiscal 2006, 2.04% in fiscal 2005 and 1.09% in fiscal 2004. As of January 28, 2006, Winners had credit lines totaling C$20 million, C$10 million to meet certain operating needs and C$10 million letter of credit facility. There were credit lines totaling C$20 million at both January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit lines was C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, C$6.8 million in fiscal 2005, and C$5.6 million in fiscal 2004. As of January 28, 2006, T.K. Maxx had a 2 million credit line to meet certain operating needs. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2006 was 1.7 million on this line. There were no outstanding borrowings on either of these credit lines as of January 28, 2006. We believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and available financing sources. 26 Table of Contents Contractual obligations: As of January 28, 2006, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long Term Contractual Obligations Long term debt obligations including estimated interest $ 884,710 $ 24,231 $ 644,590 $ 215,889 $ Operating lease commitments 5,035,904 766,622 1,413,553 1,147,319 1,708,410 Capital lease obligations 37,849 3,726 7,452 7,452 19,219 Purchase obligations 1,552,622 1,520,647 26,852 4,963 160 $ 7,511,085 $ 2,315,226 $ 2,092,447 $ 1,375,623 $ 1,727,789 The long term debt obligations above includes estimated interest costs and assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal 2008. The note holders also have a put option available to them in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 28, 2006. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006. Our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities which includes $138.7 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts of approximately $100 million, the majority of which comes due in fiscal 2010 and $133.2 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, and accounting for taxes. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the 27 Table of Contents value of the inventory. Our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bobs Stores, the value oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements do have some impact on Bobs inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for fiscal 2006 and for several years prior to fiscal 2004 were considerably less than our expected returns. These two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $82.5 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: TJXs casualty insurance program requires TJX to estimate the total claims it will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If TJXs estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2006 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2006 pre tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $5.5 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. The company has a net accrual of $34.7 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of January 28, 2006. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and several proposed adjustments are under appeal. We also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) which requires that the cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity based compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). TJX adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and elected the modified retrospective transition method. Accordingly all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R in amounts equal to the pro forma results presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) by requiring these items to be recognized as current period charges. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have any material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This Statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of 28 Table of Contents APB 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. We adopted SFAS No. 153 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle. The Statement requires retrospective application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements rather than recording the cumulative effect of the change in net earnings in the current period. SFAS No. 154 also strictly defines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (fiscal 2007 for TJX). We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 05 06, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements (EITF 05 06). EITF 05 06 provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease, collectively referred to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements. EITF 05 06 provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of (a) the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements useful lives, or (b) a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase. EITF 05 06 is effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after the date of the FASBs ratification, which was on June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05 06 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143) was issued in March 2005. This Interpretation provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event. This Interpretation requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We have determined that conditional legal obligations exist for certain of our leased facilities, primarily our distribution centers. The asset retirement obligation and the annual cost reflected in these financials is immaterial. MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes. We are also subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our revolving credit line, which has variable rate of interest. The impact on our future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings. In addition, the assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and D to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 28, 2006, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the Company. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 28, 2006, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
