ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this report under the section entitled Risk Factors. The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006) and January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2005). In November 2006, we decided to close 34 A.J. Wright stores as part of a repositioning of the chain. The following discussion focuses on our results from continuing operations, which excludes the results of these 34 A.J. Wright stores. The cost to close these stores was recorded as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the operating income or loss from these stores is also presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The closings resulted in an after tax charge of $38 million, or $0.08 per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and is discussed in more detail in Note C to the consolidated financial statements and below within the A.J. Wright discussion under Segment Information. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we discovered that we had suffered an unauthorized intrusion into the portion of our computer systems that processes and stores information related to customer transactions. We do not know who took this action, whether there were one or more intruders involved, or whether there was one continuing intrusion or multiple, separate intrusions (we refer to the intrusion or intrusions collectively as the Computer Intrusion). We have been engaged in an ongoing investigation of the Computer Intrusion and computer security and incident response experts have been engaged to assist in the investigation. We believe customer data was stolen in the Computer Intrusion in 2005 and 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the Computer Intrusion, which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the Computer Intrusion, enhance computer security and systems, and communicate with customers, as well as technical, legal, and other fees. Beyond this charge, we do not yet have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising from the Computer Intrusion. Such losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. For more information, see Item 1 Business under the caption Computer Intrusion, Note B to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion below under the caption Potential liabilities in connection with Computer Intrusion. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2007 Overview: Net sales for fiscal 2007 were $17.4 billion, a 9% increase over fiscal 2006. Consolidated same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2007 over the prior year driven by growth in unit sales and transactions across the majority of our businesses, as well as particularly strong same store sales growth at our international divisions. In addition, approximately one percentage point of this increase came from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates. We increased our number of stores by 4% in fiscal 2007, ending the fiscal year with 2,466 stores in operation. Our selling square footage grew by 4% in fiscal 2007. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was $776.8 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $689.8 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, last year. Results for prior years were impacted by certain charges and 25 one time items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $s EPS $s EPS $s EPS Income from continuing operations, as reported $ 777 $ 1.63 $ 690 $ 1.41 $ 610 $ 1.21 Charges and one time items: Correction to deferred tax liability (22 ) (0.04 ) Repatriation income tax benefit (47 ) (0.10 ) Third quarter events * 12 0.02 Cumulative lease accounting charge 19 0.04 Income from continuing operations, as adjusted $ 777 $ 1.63 $ 633 $ 1.29 $ 629 $ 1.25 * The third quarter events for fiscal 2006 include executive resignation agreements of $0.01 per share, e commerce exit costs and operating losses of $0.01 per share, and hurricane related costs including the estimated impact of lost sales of $0.01 per share, partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement of ($0.01) per share. We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of cost containment initiatives, we eliminated approximately 250 positions (including 100 open positions) and twelve of our senior executives agreed to 10% base salary reductions. These actions resulted in an estimated annualized savings of approximately $18 million. We incurred a first quarter pre tax charge in connection with the workforce reduction of $7 million. Our pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) improved from 6.3% in fiscal 2006 to 7.2% in fiscal 2007 primarily due to improved merchandise margins and expense leverage from our cost containment initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expenses and the costs incurred in connection with the Computer Intrusion. We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22 million of our shares at a cost of $557 million, which favorably affected our earnings per share. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, which is in addition to the $436 million which remained in the existing plan at fiscal 2007 year end. As a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion in December 2006, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase activity. Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 7% at the end of fiscal 2007 as compared to the prior year end when average per store inventories were down 11%. The increased inventories at fiscal 2007 year end were primarily due to a higher in stock position on spring transitional goods and an increase in the average unit retail price (average ticket). The decline at the prior year end was largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers. The following is a summary of the operating results of TJX at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share from continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify the operating results of the A.J. Wright store closings to discontinued operations. See Note C to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for fiscal 2007 totaled $17.4 billion, a 9% increase over net sales of $16.0 billion in fiscal 2006. Net sales for fiscal 2006 increased 7% over net sales of $14.9 billion for fiscal 2005. The 9% increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 includes a 5% increase attributable to new stores and a 4% increase in same store sales. The 7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 reflects 5% from new stores and 2% from same store sales. New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 4% in fiscal 2007 and 7% in fiscal 2006 over the respective prior year periods, and our selling square footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2007 and 8% 26 in fiscal 2006, in each case without adjustment for the A.J. Wright closed stores. Excluding the impact of the A.J. Wright store closings in fiscal 2007, our consolidated store count and total selling square footage each increased by 5% in fiscal 2007. We expect to add 83 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008), a 3% projected increase in our consolidated store base, and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 4%. The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as the strong performance at our international businesses (Winners same store sales increased 5% and T.K. Maxx same store sales increased 9%, both in local currency). Net sales for fiscal 2007 reflect growth in both apparel and home fashions. Within apparel, jewelry, accessories and footwear (combined), as well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well. As for home fashions, giftware and home decorative products performed well while our soft home categories (bedding, linens, etc.) were weak. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added 134 expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of stores with the expanded footwear departments to 280. These stores had same store sales growth that exceeded the chain average. During fiscal 2008, we intend to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional Marshalls stores. The expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments as of year end. Going forward, we plan to add jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and relocated stores, as well as a limited number of existing stores. In the United States, where TJX generates approximately 80% of its sales, same store sales increased across almost all regions, with the Northeast, Southwest and Mid Atlantic areas experiencing the strongest growth. Same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately one percentage point of growth. Net sales for fiscal 2006 reflected strong demand for jewelry, accessories and footwear, as well as improved demand for mens apparel. The positive impact of growth in these categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and womens sportswear. Marmaxx continued its program of expanding jewelry and accessories and footwear departments and ended fiscal 2006 with 594 T.J. Maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 Marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments. These stores had same store sales growth which exceeded Marmaxxs chain average. In the United States, same store sales were strong in warm weather regions, particularly Florida, the Southwest and California, while flat to slightly negative in the Midwest and Northeast. Same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately one half of a percentage point of growth. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of the divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.9 76.6 76.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 16.9 16.7 Interest expense, net 0.1 0.2 0.2 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 7.2 % 6.3 % 6.7 % 27 Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.9% in fiscal 2007, 76.6% in fiscal 2006 and 76.4% in fiscal 2005. This ratio for fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.4 percentage points) as well as expense leverage due to our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong same store sales growth. These improvements in the fiscal 2007 expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points). Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 0.5 percentage points. The improvement in merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions, partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs. In addition, the comparison to the fiscal 2005 expense ratio was favorably impacted by a $30.7 million non cash charge ($19.3 million after tax) in fiscal 2005 to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Lease Accounting. This charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and increased that years expense ratio by 0.2 percentage points. These improvements in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs, which reflect the de levering impact of a 2% same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than Marmaxx, which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2007, 16.9% in fiscal 2006 and 16.7% in fiscal 2005. The 0.1 percentage point decrease in fiscal 2007 reflects expense leverage across most categories, partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense (0.1 percentage point). The increase in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the de levering impact of the low single digit same store sales increase. The increase in this ratio for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was also negatively affected by the net impact of third quarter events including the costs of the executive resignation agreements, e commerce exit and hurricane related costs, offset in part by a VISA/Mastercard antitrust litigation settlement. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net of interest income, was $15.6 million for fiscal 2007, $29.6 million in fiscal 2006 and $25.8 million in fiscal 2005. Interest income was $23.6 million in fiscal 2007, $9.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $7.7 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net interest expense in fiscal 2007 was due to the increase in interest income. The increase in interest income in fiscal 2007 was driven by higher cash balances and higher rates of return on short term investments. The increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due to higher short term borrowings and interest rates. The higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases, capital expenditures and repurchase of the Companys common stock. The additional interest expense from short term borrowings was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to the repayment of $100 million of 7% unsecured notes in June 2005, as well as an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.7% in fiscal 2007, 31.6% in fiscal 2006 and 38.3% in fiscal 2005. The increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate reflected the absence of one time tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (described in more detail below) which favorably impacted the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage points. The fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate benefited through July 20, 2006 from the tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses on certain intercompany loans between Winners and TJX. This tax treatment reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by 0.2 percentage points. Effective July 20, 2006, we re designated one of these intercompany loans and the related hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations, and gains and losses on these items after July 20, 2006 are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by increased income at our foreign operations (a portion of which are taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations) as well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the related reserves. Combined, these two items reduced the effective income tax rate by 0.6 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006. The tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth quarter benefit of $47 million due to the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiary. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we corrected our accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans. We previously established a deferred tax liability on these gains (which are not taxable). The impact of correcting for the tax treatment of these gains resulted in a tax benefit of $22 million, or $0.04 per share in fiscal 2006. The cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was $18.2 million, all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 28 fiscal 2006. Of the $18.2 million, $10.1 million related to fiscal 2005. These two items collectively reduced the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage points. See Note I to the consolidated financial statements. Income from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $776.8 million in fiscal 2007, $689.8 million in fiscal 2006 and $610.2 million in fiscal 2005. Income from continuing operations per share was $1.63 in fiscal 2007, $1.41 in fiscal 2006 and $1.21 in fiscal 2005. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, TJX did not have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007, but will have a 53rd week in fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by an after tax charge relating to the Computer Intrusion of approximately $3 million, which reduced fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.01 per share. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $47 million, or $0.10 per share, due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of $22 million, or $0.04 per share, relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. Favorable changes in currency exchange rates added approximately $0.03 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 and approximately $0.01 per share in fiscal 2006. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately $12 million, or $0.02 per share, due to the third quarter events. These third quarter events included the after tax cost of executive resignation agreements, primarily with respect to our former CEO ($5 million), e commerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million), and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes, including the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million). Operating losses of the e commerce operation in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely offset by fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss in fiscal 2005. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was reduced by $19.3 million, or $0.04 per share, as a result of the after tax effect of the $30.7 million cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Lease Accounting. Lastly, favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 added approximately $0.02 to our earnings per share. The change in earnings per share from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2007 we repurchased 22.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $557 million, which was less than planned as we temporarily suspended our buyback activity in December 2006 as a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion. In fiscal 2006 we repurchased 25.9 million shares at a cost of $600 million. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, which is in addition to the $436 million remaining in the existing plan. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2008 with planned purchases of approximately $900 million. Fourth Quarter Results: Fourth quarter income from continuing operations was $243 million, or $0.51 per share, in fiscal 2007, $287 million, or $0.59 per share, in fiscal 2006 and $165 million, or $0.33 per share, in fiscal 2005. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were impacted by certain charges and one time items that affect the comparability of reported results. The chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter income from continuing operations and earnings per share: Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2005 Dollars In Millions Except Per Share Amounts $s EPS $s EPS $s EPS Income from continuing operations, as reported $ 243 $ 0.51 $ 287 $ 0.59 $ 165 $ 0.33 Charges and one time items: Correction to deferred tax liability (22 ) (0.04 ) Repatriation income tax benefit (47 ) (0.10 ) Cumulative lease accounting charge 19 0.04 Income from continuing operations, as adjusted $ 243 $ 0.51 $ 218 $ 0.45 $ 184 $ 0.37 We believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis, and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business. 29 Excluding these charges and one time items from fiscal 2006, the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $243 million increased 11% and earnings per share of $0.51 increased 13%. Pre tax profit margin was 7.5% in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Pre tax margin improved on the strength of strong same store sales at Winners, T.K. Maxx and HomeGoods, resulting in expense leverage across most categories. This improvement in the pre tax margin was offset by costs related to the Computer Intrusion (0.1 percentage point), a planned increase in advertising expense (0.2 percentage points) and an increase in occupancy costs at T.K. Maxx (0.1 percentage point) as well as the year over year decline in A.J. Wrights and Bobs Stores segment profit margins. Discontinued operations and net income: Our results from continuing operations exclude the results of operations and the cost of closing 34 A.J. Wright stores. See Segment Information A.J. Wright below and Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Net income, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $738 million, or $1.55 per share for fiscal 2007, $690 million, or $1.41 per share for fiscal 2006 and $610 million, or $1.21 per share in fiscal 2005. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense and interest. Segment profit or loss as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. More detailed information about our segments, including a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes can be found in Note O to the consolidated financial statements. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments (U.S. dollars in millions): Segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segments share of the cumulative pre tax charge relating to lease accounting. See Note A to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Lease Accounting. Marmaxx: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 11,531.8 $ 10,956.8 $ 10,489.5 Segment profit 1,079.3 985.4 982.1 Segment profit as a % of net sales 9.4 % 9.0 % 9.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 2 % 2 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,569 1,514 1,468 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 38,468 36,987 35,544 Marmaxx posted a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2007, consistent with the prior year. Both apparel and home fashions reported same store sales growth in fiscal 2007 with apparel performing slightly better than home fashions. Same store sales of jewelry and accessories and footwear, combined, as well as misses sportswear and dresses were above the chain average. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added 134 expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of expanded footwear stores to 280. During fiscal 2008, we intend to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional Marshalls stores. The expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments as of year end. Going forward, we will add jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and relocated stores, as well as a limited number of existing stores. Geographically in fiscal 2007, regions that performed above the chain average were the Southwest, Northeast and Mid Atlantic. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (segment margin) increased to 9.4% in fiscal 2007 from 9.0% in fiscal 2006. The increase in the fiscal 2007 segment margin was largely driven by 0.2 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin, primarily due to lower markdowns, and expense leverage across most categories due to our cost containment initiatives. Additionally, fiscal 2007 includes the favorable impact on current year casualty insurance and employee medical costs due to favorable claims experience. These improvements in segment margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a planned increased in marketing costs (0.1 percentage point). As of January 27, 2007, average inventories per store were up 8% compared to a 10% decline at the prior year end. The increase at fiscal 2007 year end was primarily due to our in stock position on spring transitional goods and 30 an increase in average ticket. The decline at the prior year end was largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers. Segment margin decreased to 9.0% in fiscal 2006 from 9.4% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was largely driven by the de levering impact of a 2% same store sales increase, which impacted operating expense ratios, primarily occupancy costs (which increased 0.3 percentage points) and distribution center costs (which increased 0.1 percentage point). In addition, certain of the third quarter events described above (e commerce and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the VISA/MasterCard settlement) reduced segment margin in fiscal 2006 by 0.1 percentage point. The comparison to the fiscal 2005 margin was favorably impacted by the inclusion in fiscal 2005s segment profit of a $16.8 million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment, which reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by 0.2 percentage points. Merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related increases in freight costs. We added a net of 55 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2007, and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4%. We expect to open 50 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2008, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 3%. Winners and HomeSense: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 1,740.8 $ 1,457.7 $ 1,285.4 Segment profit 181.9 120.3 99.7 Segment profit as a % of net sales 10.4 % 8.3 % 7.8 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 11 % 4 % 10 % Local currency 5 % (3 )% 4 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 184 174 168 HomeSense 68 58 40 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,214 4,012 3,811 HomeSense 1,280 1,100 747 Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, for fiscal 2007 increased by 19% over fiscal 2006, with approximately one third of this growth due to currency exchange rates. Same store sales (in local currency) increased by 5% in fiscal 2007 and decreased by 3% in fiscal 2006. Same store sales for fiscal 2007 were favorably impacted by improved merchandise flow and increased brand penetration. In terms of product categories, same store sales were driven by strong growth in jewelry, footwear and accessories as well as home fashions. HomeSense performed well, favorably impacting this divisions results. Same store sales and operating results for HomeSense were significantly improved over the prior year. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 was up 2.1 percentage points to 10.4% compared to 8.3% for fiscal 2006. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a 1.4 percentage point increase in merchandise margins (improved markon and lower markdowns) combined with improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). These increases were partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs which increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 improved by 0.5 percentage points compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily due to a 2.9 percentage point increase in merchandise margins, which were driven by improved inventory management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower markdowns. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the de levering impact of the 3% decline in same store sales. Expense ratios increased across most categories, with a 1.4 percentage point increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most significant. Incremental costs associated with three store closings in fiscal 2006 also adversely affected segment profit. The comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a $3.5 million charge for this divisions share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment. We added a net of 10 Winners stores and 10 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2007, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 7%. We expect to add a net of 4 Winners and 3 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2008, increasing our total 31 Canadian store base by 3%, and increasing selling square footage by 3%. The store counts include the Winners and HomeSense portions of this divisions superstores, which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side by side. As of January 27, 2007 we operated 29 of these superstores. T.K. Maxx: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 1,864.5 $ 1,517.1 $ 1,304.4 Segment profit 109.3 69.2 64.0 Segment profit as a % of net sales 5.9 % 4.6 % 4.9 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 13 % (1 )% 14 % Local currency 9 % 1 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 210 197 170 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 4,636 4,216 3,491 Net sales in fiscal 2007 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, increased by 23% over fiscal 2006, with approximately one fifth of this growth due to currency exchange rates. T.K. Maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 9% (in local currency) in fiscal 2007 with growth in both home fashions and most apparel categories. Apparel categories that performed well included dresses, accessories and footwear, while misses sportswear was below the chain average. Segment profit margin improved to 5.9% of sales for fiscal 2007 compared to 4.6% for fiscal 2006. The 1.3 percentage point improvement was due to merchandise margin, which was up 0.9 percentage points (primarily due to lower markdowns), as well as expense leverage from the 9% same store sales increase. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent, utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store relocations. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 declined 0.3 percentage points to 4.6% of sales. T.K. Maxx had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006, primarily due to lower markdowns. In addition, the comparison of segment profit and segment margin of fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 was favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of this divisions share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of $6.5 million. These improvements however, were more than offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost for rent, utilities and property taxes as well as the de levering impact of a 1% same store sales increase. Distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005, despite the low same store sales increase. We added a net of 13 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2007 and increased the divisions selling square footage by 10%. We plan to open a net of 10 T.K. Maxx stores in fiscal 2008, and expand selling square footage by 7%. Also, we expect to expand into Germany with 5 store openings planned for fiscal 2008. HomeGoods: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 1,365.1 $ 1,186.9 $ 1,012.9 Segment profit 60.9 28.4 18.1 Segment profit as a % of net sales 4.5 % 2.4 % 1.8 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 1 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 270 251 216 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 5,181 4,859 4,159 HomeGoods same store sales grew 4% in fiscal 2007, due to strong growth in giftware and home decorative products. Segment profit increased to $60.9 million from $28.4 million, and segment profit margin almost doubled to 4.5% of sales. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from the leverage of expenses across most categories, most notably in distribution center and occupancy expenses. Additionally, merchandise margin increased 0.4 percentage points primarily due to higher markon. HomeGoods same store sales grew 1% in fiscal 2006. Customer transactions and unit sales increased at HomeGoods during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, but these increases were partially offset by a decline in the 32 average ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise mix. Segment profit increased to $28.4 million from $18.1 million, and segment profit margin increased to 2.4% of sales from 1.8% of sales in the prior year. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in merchandise margin (lower markdowns partially offset by the impact of higher freight costs), as well as the impact on prior year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of $2.2 million. We opened a net of 19 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2007, an 8% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 7%. In fiscal 2008, we plan to add a net of 12 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 5%. A.J. Wright: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 601.8 $ 549.0 $ 477.9 Segment profit (loss) (10.3 ) (3.2 ) (18.8 ) Segment profit (loss) as a % of net sales (1.7 )% (0.6 )% (3.9 )% Percent increase in same store sales 3 % 3 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 129 152 130 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,577 3,054 2,606 A.J. Wrights same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2007, consistent with the prior year. A.J. Wrights segment loss for fiscal 2007 increased to $10.3 million compared to $3.2 million for the prior year. This decline is primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise margin (1.2 percentage points) due to markdowns on below plan sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of a plan to reposition this business, we identified 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores for closing, virtually all of which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end. The cost to close these stores and their historical operating results are presented as discontinued operations as described below. By closing these marginally profitable stores, we reduced the number of advertising markets in which A.J. Wright operates enabling better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater efficiencies in store operations and logistics. The store closings also allow management to focus their attention and resources on the remaining, better performing stores. A.J. Wrights same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2006, compared to a 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005. A.J. Wrights segment loss for fiscal 2006 was narrowed to $3.2 million from $18.8 million in fiscal 2005. This improvement was driven by improved merchandise margin, primarily the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006. The comparison to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion of a $1.7 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of the lease accounting adjustment. In fiscal 2006, effective expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales across most expense categories, primarily in advertising and store payroll and benefits. We reduced the number of our new store openings for A.J. Wright in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2005 as we believed that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too aggressive for this division, placing a strain on operations. The table above presents A.J. Wrights operating results from continuing operations. Stores in operation and selling square footage for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 include store counts and square footage for the stores that are part of our discontinued operations. As described earlier, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we identified 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores to be closed as part of our plan to reposition this business. In connection with this action, we incurred an after tax charge of $38 million in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter. This charge represents costs related to asset impairment, remaining lease liability (net of expected subtenant income), and severance and other costs. We have classified these exit costs, along with operating income or loss related to these stores, as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented. The operating income or loss for each year represents the operating results from store operations, reduced by an allocation of direct and incremental distribution and administrative costs relating to the closed stores. No interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations. The following table presents the net sales and segment profit (loss) of the closed stores in operation for the last three fiscal years which have been reclassified to discontinued operations: 33 Discontinued operations: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 111.8 $ 102.0 $ 52.7 Segment profit (loss) (1.0 ) 1.0 (0.8 ) Closed stores in operation during period 34 33 22 We currently plan to open 5 A. J. Wright stores in fiscal 2008. We continue to believe that A.J. Wright can be a growth vehicle for TJX, with its very sizable target demographic. Bobs Stores: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 300.6 $ 288.5 $ 290.6 Segment profit (loss) (17.4 ) (28.0 ) (18.5 ) Segment profit (loss) as a % of net sales (5.8 )% (9.7 )% (6.4 )% Percent increase in same store sales 2 % N/A N/A Stores in operation at end of period 36 35 32 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 1,306 1,276 1,166 Bobs Stores net sales increased 4% for fiscal 2007, compared to a slight decrease last year. Same store sales increased 2% with our expanded womens casual sportswear departments performing well. Bobs Stores reduced its segment losses for the fiscal year due to the sales growth combined with significant improvement in merchandise margins. Merchandise margin increases were driven by improved markon, the result of better buying, which more than offset increases in promotional markdowns as we significantly increased the level of promotions in this business. Net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional advertising circulars. Although merchandise margin improved in fiscal 2006 (due to lower promotional markdowns) the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Segment loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs of $0.8 million in connection with a reduction in the work force at Bobs Stores. For fiscal 2008, we do not plan to open any new stores for this division as we continue to evaluate this business and assess its potential for future growth. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars In Millions 2007 2006 2005 General corporate expense $ 141.4 $ 134.1 $ 111.1 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting, internal audit, compliance, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Fiscal 2007 included pre tax charges of approximately $5 million related to the Computer Intrusion, and approximately $5 million related to the corporate divisions cost of the workforce reduction and other termination benefits, while fiscal 2006 included costs of $9 million associated with executive resignation agreements and $6 million of costs to exit the e commerce business. The increase in other general corporate expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in corporate payroll, corporate marketing and consulting costs, charitable contributions, and European expansion costs. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with executive resignation agreements ($9 million) and of exiting the e commerce business of ($6 million). Both of these 34 items occurred in our third quarter ended October 29, 2005. In addition, general corporate expense for fiscal 2006 includes a charge ($4 million) in connection with an idle leased facility. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,195.0 million in fiscal 2007, $1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $1,076.8 million in fiscal 2005. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by $ 37.0 million driven by an increase in net income (adjusted for depreciation) of $86.4 million. The change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year end levels was a significant component of operating cash flows. In fiscal 2007, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $151.2 million compared to a source of cash of $26.2 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows were also reduced by higher income tax payments. These reductions in fiscal 2007 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2006 were offset by the favorable cash flow impact of changes in deferred income taxes, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 increased by $ 81.2 million compared to operating cash flows for fiscal 2005. Net income (adjusted for depreciation) for fiscal 2006 increased by approximately $116 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a source of cash of $26.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a use of cash of $85.3 million in fiscal 2005. These increases in fiscal 2006 operating cash flow as compared to fiscal 2005 were offset by the unfavorable cash impact of changes in prepaid expenses and deferred taxes. The variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period. Average per store inventories at January 27, 2007, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, increased 7% compared to a decrease of 11% at January 28, 2006. This compares to inventories per store at January 29, 2005 that were up 1% compared to the prior year. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of our A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to the consolidated financial statements) as well as leases of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January 27, January 28, January 29, Amounts in Thousands 2007 2006 2005 Balance at beginning of year $ 14,981 $ 12,365 $ 17,518 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings 61,968 All other 1,555 8,509 2,254 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (1,696 ) (6,111 ) (7,066 ) Fixed asset write offs (18,732 ) All other (399 ) 218 (341 ) Balance at end of year $ 57,677 $ 14,981 $ 12,365 The exit costs related to 34 of our A.J. Wright stores resulted in an addition to the reserve of $62 million in fiscal 2007. All other additions to the reserve are the result of periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and are offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges against the reserve during each fiscal year relate primarily to our former businesses. The fixed asset write offs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 relate primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores, virtually all of which were closed at the end of fiscal 2007. 35 Approximately $43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against TJX for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 27, 2007, substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against TJX had been resolved. The actual net cost of A.J. Wright lease obligations may differ from our original estimate. Although TJXs actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and TJX may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired, TJX does not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of this reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJs Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, for which BJs Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to TJX with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJs Wholesale Club. Potential liabilities in connection with Computer Intrusion We believe that customer information was stolen in the Computer Intrusion in 2005 and 2006 and that such information most likely primarily relates to transactions at our stores (other than Bobs Stores) during the periods 2003 through June 2004 and mid May 2006 through mid December 2006. See Item 1 Business under the caption Computer Intrusion. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the Computer Intrusion, which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the Computer Intrusion, strengthen computer security and systems, and communicate with customers, and for technical, legal and other fees. In addition, various litigation and claims have been (or may be) asserted against us and or our acquiring banks on behalf of customers (including various putative class actions seeking in the aggregate to represent all customers in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada whose transaction information was allegedly compromised by the Computer Intrusion), banks and payment card companies seeking damages allegedly arising out of the Computer Intrusion and other related relief (including a putative class action seeking to represent all financial institutions that issued payment cards to our customers used at our stores during the period of the Computer Intrusion) and shareholders. We intend to defend such litigation and claims vigorously, although the outcome of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted. In addition, various governmental agencies are investigating the Computer Intrusion, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations as a result of these investigations. Certain banks have sought, and other banks and payment card companies may seek, either directly against us or through claims against our acquiring banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation, payment of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating expenses that they believe they have incurred by reason of the Computer Intrusion, and payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines by reason of the Computer Intrusion. We do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate losses that may result from such litigation, claims and investigations. As such, no liability has been recorded as of January 27, 2007. We will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Such losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, claims, litigation and proceedings of this type are expensive and could require us to devote substantial resources and time to defending them. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. 36 We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJs Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $105 million as of January 27, 2007. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to TJX and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January 27, January 28, Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 New stores $ 123.0 $ 171.9 Store renovations and improvements 190.2 267.1 Office and distribution centers 64.8 56.9 Capital expenditures $ 378.0 $ 495.9 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $500 million for fiscal 2008, which we expect to pay through internally generated funds. This includes $108 million for new stores, $267 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $125 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores, particularly T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and T.K. Maxx, as well as an increase in capital spending for systems enhancements and improvements to the distribution centers. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $418.0 million in fiscal 2007, $503.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $584.6 million in fiscal 2005. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $557.2 million in fiscal 2007, $603.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $594.6 million in fiscal 2005 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007, 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006 and 25.1 million shares in fiscal 2005. All shares repurchased were retired. Through January 27, 2007, under our current $1 billion multi year stock repurchase program, we had spent $564 million on the repurchase of 22.3 million shares of TJX common stock. As a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion in December 2006, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase activity. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $1 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, which is in addition to the $436 million remaining in the existing plan at fiscal 2007 year end. In January 2006, Winners entered into a C$235 million (US$204.4) term credit facility, guaranteed by TJX. This credit facility was originally due in January 2009 and has been extended to January 2010. Interest is payable at rates equal to, or less than the Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively established a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of Winners earnings to TJX as well as other general corporate purposes of this division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006 and $5 million in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2007, there were no scheduled principal payments on long term debt. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007, $0.24 per share in fiscal 2006 and $0.18 per share in fiscal 2005. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $122.9 million in fiscal 2007, $105.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $83.4 million in fiscal 2005. Financing activities also 37 included proceeds of $260.2 in fiscal 2007, $102.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $96.9 million in fiscal 2005 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million, four year revolving credit facility and our $500 million, five year revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal 2006), to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These credit facilities have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we issue commercial paper from time to time. These agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program. As of January 27, 2007, we had no short term debt outstanding. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $205 million during fiscal 2007, $567 million during fiscal 2006, and $5 million during fiscal 2005. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short term borrowings was 5.35% in fiscal 2007, 3.69% in fiscal 2006 and 2.04% in fiscal 2005. As of January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2006, Winners had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line for operating expenses was C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007, C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, and C$6.8 million in fiscal 2005, and there were no amounts outstanding on either of these lines at the end of fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. As of January 27, 2007, T.K. Maxx had credit lines totaling 20 million. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2007 was 10.5 million and there were no outstanding borrowings on this credit line at January 27, 2007. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and available financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 27, 2007, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations including estimated interest $ 917,027 $ 25,565 $ 450,132 $ $ 441,330 Operating lease commitments 5,118,104 845,622 1,544,742 1,175,575 1,552,165 Capital lease obligations 34,124 3,726 7,452 7,623 15,323 Purchase obligations 2,037,641 1,946,407 72,912 18,322 Total obligations $ 8,106,896 $ 2,821,320 $ 2,075,238 $ 1,201,520 $ 2,008,818 The long term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 27, 2007. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities which include $120.0 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts of approximately $100.0 million, the majority of which come 38 due in fiscal 2010, and $142.0 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table. Critical Accounting Policies TJX must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to inventory valuation, retirement obligations, casualty insurance, accounting for taxes, reserves for discontinued operations and loss contingencies. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bobs Stores, the value oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements may have some impact on Bobs Stores inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $65 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: TJXs casualty insurance program requires TJX to estimate the total claims it will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If TJXs estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2007 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2007 pre tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $5 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. The company has a net accrual of $31.4 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of January 27, 2007. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by the United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and several proposed adjustments are under appeal. We also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. 39 Reserves for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note L to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the managements discussion and analysis, we have reserves established for leases relating to operations discontinued by TJX where TJX was the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties. These are long term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease, amounts of subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. Actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate cost we will incur. Loss Contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to TJX but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. TJXs management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against TJX or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, TJXs legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then TJX will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet; the recognition in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising during the period but which are not included as components of periodic benefit cost; the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date (the measurement provisions); and disclosure of additional information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the current period. The requirement to recognize the funded status of the plan on the balance sheet is required for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007 and is reflected in our accompanying financial statements. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income of initially applying the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 was a reduction, net of taxes, of $5.6 million. The requirement to measure the plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date can be deferred until our fiscal year ending January 2008. The current measurement date of our plans is December 31 and we have elected to defer adopting the measurement provisions until next fiscal year. The impact of applying the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158 will not have a material impact on our statement of financial position. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. The Interpretation requires that we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. If a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition criteria, FIN 48 requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption. This accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (fiscal 2008 for the Company). Upon adoption, we anticipate an increase to our reserves for uncertain tax positions. We do not expect that the impact will be material to our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements 40 issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and E to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 27, 2007, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by TJX. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings will affect the impact on our future interest expense of future changes in interest rates. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year. As of January 27, 2007, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Market Risk The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties.
