ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of this report under the section entitled Risk Factors. The discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008), January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007) and January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2006). In November 2006, we announced our decision to close 34 A.J. Wright stores as part of a repositioning of the chain. The following discussion reviews our results from continuing operations, which excludes the results of the closed A.J. Wright stores. The cost to close these stores was recorded as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the operating income or loss from these stores is also presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. All references in the following discussion are to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. We suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (such intrusion or intrusions collectively, the Computer Intrusion) into portions of our computer system, which was discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and in which we believe customer data were stolen. See Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs below and Note B to the consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations FISCAL 2008 OVERVIEW: Net sales for fiscal 2008 were $18.6 billion, a 7% increase over fiscal 2007. Consolidated same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2008 over the prior year. Currency exchange rates favorably impacted same store sales growth contributing approximately two percentage points to the increase. We increased both the number of our stores and our selling square footage by 4% in fiscal 2008. We ended the fiscal year with 2,563 stores in operation. The fiscal 2008 results reflect pre tax charges of $197.0 million with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including pre tax costs of $37.8 million we expensed as incurred in the first six months and a $159.2 million charge for a pre tax reserve for estimated losses thereafter. Our pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) declined from 7.2% in fiscal 2007 to 6.7% in fiscal 2008. The Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs, which reduced our pre tax margin by 1.0% for fiscal 2008, more than offset what would otherwise have been an increase in our pre tax margin. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was $771.8 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to $776.8 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, last year. Fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations was reduced by $119 million, or $0.25 per share, for the after tax impact of the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs. Fiscal 2007 income from continuing operations was reduced by $3 million for such costs, which did not change the fiscal 2007 earnings per share. We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million, which favorably affected our earnings per share. Average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 2% at the end of fiscal 2008 as compared to an increase of 7% for the prior year end. The following is a summary of our operating results at the consolidated level. This discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment. All references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share from continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. All prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify the operating results of the A.J. Wright store closings to discontinued operations. See also Note C to our consolidated financial statements. Net sales: Net sales for fiscal 2008 totaled $18.6 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of $17.4 billion in fiscal 2007. Net sales for fiscal 2007 increased 9% over net sales of $16.0 billion for fiscal 2006. The 7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 reflects a 3% increase from new stores and a 4% increase in same store sales. The 9% increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 reflects increases of 5% from new stores and 4% from same store sales. 17 Table of Contents New stores are a major source of sales growth. Our consolidated store count increased by 4% in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 over the respective prior year periods, and our selling square footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2008 and 5% in fiscal 2007. We expect to add 109 stores (net of store closings) in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), a 4% increase in our consolidated store base. We also expect to increase our selling square footage base by 4%. The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven by a strong performance at our international businesses as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately two percentage points of growth. At our domestic divisions, sales of dresses, footwear and accessories were strong, partially offset by softer sales in the balance of the womens apparel category. Home categories at Marmaxx, our largest division, were also weak. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2008, we rolled out expanded footwear departments in approximately 240 Marshalls stores and plan to continue this expansion in approximately 200 Marshalls stores in fiscal 2009, bringing the total to approximately 720. Same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our international businesses were above the consolidated average. Within the U. S., the strongest regions were the West coast and the Northeast, while Florida and the Southeast trailed the U.S. average. Overall transaction volume was slightly down, more than offset by an increase in the average ticket. The 4% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as the strong performance at our international businesses (Winners same store sales increased 5% and T.K. Maxx same store sales increased 6%, both in local currency). Net sales for fiscal 2007 reflected growth in both apparel and home fashions. Within apparel, jewelry, accessories and footwear (combined), as well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well. As for home fashions, giftware and home decorative products performed well while our soft home categories (bedding, linens, etc.) did not perform to our expectations. Same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2007, we added 134 expanded footwear departments, bringing the total number of stores with the expanded footwear departments to 280. These stores had same store sales growth that exceeded the chain average. The expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at T.J. Maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007, with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments at year end. In the U. S., same store sales increased across almost all regions, with the Northeast, Southwest and Mid Atlantic areas experiencing the strongest growth. Same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed approximately one percentage point of growth. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in U.S. dollars. We also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of the divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.5 75.9 76.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 16.8 16.9 Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs 1.0 Interest (income) expense, net 0.1 0.2 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 6.7 % 7.2 % 6.3 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.5% in fiscal 2008, 75.9% in fiscal 2007 and 76.6% in fiscal 2006. This ratio for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.5 percentage points), due to improved markon and lower markdowns. Throughout fiscal 2008, we solidly executed our off price fundamentals, buying close to need and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. This merchandise margin improvement was partially 18 Table of Contents offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. All other buying and occupancy costs remained relatively flat as compared to the same period last year. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2007 as compared with fiscal 2006 reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.4 percentage points) as well as expense leverage due to our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong same store sales growth. These improvements in the fiscal 2007 expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some operating costs as a percentage of net sales, primarily occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points). Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and was 16.9% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2008 expense ratio remained consistent with the prior year with a planned increase in advertising costs (0.1 percentage point) and a fourth quarter impairment charge at our Bobs Stores division (0.1 percentage point) being offset by our continuing cost containment initiatives. The decrease in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 reflects expense leverage across most categories, partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense (0.1 percentage point). Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: We face potential liabilities and costs as a result of claims, litigation and investigations with respect to the Computer Intrusion. During the first six months of fiscal 2008, we expensed pre tax costs of $37.8 million for costs we incurred related to the Computer Intrusion. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we were able to reasonably estimate our potential losses related to the Computer Intrusion and, accordingly, established a pre tax reserve of $178.1 million and recorded a pre tax charge in that amount. Subsequently, as previously disclosed, we settled the purported customer class actions (subject to final court approval), settled claims of Visa USA, Visa Inc. and substantially all U.S. Visa issuers and settled with most of the named plaintiffs in the purported financial institution class action. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reduced our reserve and the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs by $18.9 million as a result of insurance proceeds with respect to the Computer Intrusion, which had not previously been reflected in the reserve, as well as a reduction in our estimated legal and other fees as we have continued to resolve outstanding disputes, litigation and investigations. As of January 26, 2008, our reserve balance was $117.3 million reflecting amounts paid for settlements (primarily the Visa settlement), legal and other fees. Our reserve reflects our current estimation of probable losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with respect to the Computer Intrusion and includes our current estimation of total potential cash liabilities, from pending litigation, proceedings, investigations and other claims, as well as legal and other costs and expenses, arising from the Computer Intrusion. In addition, we expect to record non cash costs with respect to the customer class actions settlement, if finally approved, when incurred, which we do not expect to be material to our financial statements. As an estimate, our reserve is subject to uncertainty, and our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for developments in the course and resolution of litigation, claims and investigations and related expenses and for other changes in our estimates. Interest (income) expense, net: Interest (income) expense, net amounted to income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008, expense of $15.6 million for fiscal 2007 and expense of $29.6 million in fiscal 2006. These changes were the result of interest income totaling $40.7 million in the fiscal 2008 versus $23.6 million for fiscal 2007 and $9.4 million in fiscal 2006. The additional interest income in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007, as well as fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006, was due to higher cash balances available for investment, as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.9% in fiscal 2008, 37.7% in fiscal 2007 and 31.6% in fiscal 2006. The increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007 one time benefits as well as an increase due to certain FIN 48 tax positions, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased income at our foreign operations and increased foreign tax credits. During fiscal 2008, we changed our assertion regarding the undistributed earnings of one of our Puerto Rican subsidiaries. Beginning in fiscal 2008s third quarter, we concluded that the undistributed earnings of our Puerto Rican subsidiary that operates Marshalls stores would not be permanently reinvested. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax liability for the effect of the undistributed income and, in addition, we were able to fully recognize the benefit of accumulated foreign tax credits that had been earned at the subsidiary level. The net impact of this change in assertion was a reduction in our effective income tax rate of 0.4 percentage points. Prior to this period, the earnings of this Puerto Rican subsidiary were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate reflected the absence of one time tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (benefit for repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiary and the correction of accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans) which favorably impacted the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 6.8 percentage points. The fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate benefited through July 20, 19 Table of Contents 2006 from the tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses on certain intercompany loans between Winners and TJX. This tax treatment reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by 0.2 percentage points. Effective July 20, 2006, we re designated one of these intercompany loans and the related hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations, and gains and losses on these items after July 20, 2006 are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by increased income at our foreign operations (a portion of which is taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations) as well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the related reserves. Combined, these two items reduced the effective income tax rate by 0.6 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006. Income from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $771.8 million in fiscal 2008, $776.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $689.8 million in fiscal 2006. Income from continuing operations per share was $1.66 in fiscal 2008, $1.63 in fiscal 2007 and $1.41 in fiscal 2006. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, we did not have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007, but will have a 53rd week in fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was adversely impacted by the charge relating to the Computer Intrusion of approximately $119 million, after tax, which reduced earnings per share by $0.25 per share. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by the charge relating to the Computer Intrusion of approximately $3 million, after tax, which reduced fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.01 per share but did not change full year earnings per share. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $47 million, or $0.10 per share, due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of $22 million, or $0.04 per share, relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability. In addition, income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately $12 million, or $0.02 per share, due to certain third quarter events. These third quarter events included the after tax cost of executive resignation agreements, primarily with respect to our former CEO ($5 million), e commerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses ($6 million), and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes, including the estimated impact of lost sales ($6 million), all of which were partially offset by a gain from a VISA/MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement ($5 million). Favorable changes in currency exchange rates added approximately $0.05 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2008 and approximately $0.03 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2007. In addition, the change in earnings per share in each fiscal year was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 33.3 million shares of our stock at a cost of $950 million. In fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $557 million, which was less than planned, as we temporarily suspended our buyback activity in December 2006 as a result of the discovery and investigation of the Computer Intrusion. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2009 with planned purchases of approximately $900 million. Discontinued operations and net income: Our results from continuing operations exclude the results of operations and the cost of closing 34 A.J. Wright stores. See Segment Information A.J. Wright below and Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Net income, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share for fiscal 2008, $738.0 million, or $1.55 per share for fiscal 2007 and $690.4 million, or $1.41 per share for fiscal 2006. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. We consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs and interest. Segment profit or loss as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from 20 Table of Contents operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments (U.S. dollars in millions): MARMAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 11,966.7 $ 11,531.8 $ 10,956.8 Segment profit $ 1,158.2 $ 1,079.3 $ 985.4 Segment profit as a % of net sales 9.7 % 9.4 % 9.0 % Percent increase in same store sales 1 % 2 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period 1,623 1,569 1,514 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 39,784 38,468 36,987 Marmaxx, which operates the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store chains, posted a 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2008 compared to a 2% same store sales increase in fiscal 2007. Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2008 reflected strong same store sales increases in less weather sensitive categories such as dresses, footwear and accessories. During fiscal 2008, we added expanded footwear departments to approximately 240 Marshalls stores and plan to add expanded departments to an additional 200 stores in fiscal 2009, taking the total to approximately 720. Home categories at Marmaxx underperformed in fiscal 2008 and we have taken measures to improve in this area of our execution. Geographically in fiscal 2008, same store sales for the Northeast, Southwest and West Coast were above the chain average, while same store sales in Florida and the Midwest were below the chain average. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (segment margin or segment profit margin) increased to 9.7% in fiscal 2008 from 9.4% in fiscal 2007. Segment margin was favorably impacted by merchandise margins, which increased 0.4 percentage points (as a percentage of net sales) due to lower markdowns and a higher markon, as well as some expense leverage due to our cost containment measures. These improvements in segment margin were partly offset by an increase in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a planned increase in advertising expense (0.1 percentage point). As of January 26, 2008, average inventories per store were down 2% compared to an 8% increase at the prior year end. The increase at the prior year end was primarily due to our in stock position on spring transitional goods and an increase in average ticket. Segment margin increased to 9.4% in fiscal 2007 from 9.0% in fiscal 2006. The increase was largely driven by a 0.2 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin, primarily due to lower markdowns, and expense leverage across most categories due to our cost containment initiatives. Additionally, fiscal 2007 included the favorable impact on current year casualty insurance and employee medical costs of favorable claims experience. These improvements in segment margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs (0.2 percentage points) and a planned increase in marketing costs (0.1 percentage point). We added a net of 54 new stores (T.J. Maxx or Marshalls) in fiscal 2008, and increased total selling square footage of the division by 3%. We expect to open approximately 45 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2009, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 2%. 21 Table of Contents WINNERS AND HOMESENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 2,040.8 $ 1,740.8 $ 1,457.7 Segment profit $ 235.1 $ 181.9 $ 120.3 Segment profit as a % of net sales 11.5 % 10.4 % 8.3 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 14 % 11 % 4 % Local currency 5 % 5 % (3 )% Stores in operation at end of period Winners 191 184 174 HomeSense 71 68 58 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,389 4,214 4,012 HomeSense 1,358 1,280 1,100 Net sales for Winners and HomeSense, our Canadian businesses, for fiscal 2008 increased by 17% over fiscal 2007, with approximately one half of this growth due to currency exchange rates. Same store sales (in local currency) increased by 5% in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Same store sales for fiscal 2008 were positively impacted by sales of home fashions, footwear, jewelry and accessories. HomeSense continued to perform well, favorably impacting same store sales in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased 1.1 percentage points to 11.5% compared to 10.4% for fiscal 2007. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). Currency exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately $24 million for fiscal 2008. Most of this increase is due to currency translation, which also impacts sales growth and, therefore, has no impact on segment margin. The increase in segment profit due to currency exchange rates also included the favorable impact of the mark to market adjustment of inventory hedge contracts which increased segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. The inventory hedge contracts are designed to lock in the cost of merchandise purchases that are denominated in U.S. dollars. The fiscal 2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in merchandise margin, primarily due to increased markon as well the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and strong same store sales results on expense ratios. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 increased 2.1 percentage points to 10.4% compared to 8.3% for fiscal 2006. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a 1.4 percentage point increase in merchandise margins (improved markon and lower markdowns) combined with improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). These increases were partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs which increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. We added a net of 7 Winners stores and 3 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2008, and expanded selling square footage in Canada by 5%. We expect to add a net of 9 Winners and 4 HomeSense stores in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we plan to test a new off price concept with 3 new stores in Canada in fiscal 2009, which will bring our total Canadian store base up by 5%, and increase selling square footage by 6%. The store counts include the Winners and HomeSense portions of this divisions superstores, which either combine a Winners store with a HomeSense store or operates them side by side. As of January 26, 2008 we operated 30 of these superstores. T.K. MAXX: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 2,216.2 $ 1,864.5 $ 1,517.1 Segment profit $ 127.2 $ 109.3 $ 69.2 Segment profit as a % of net sales 5.7 % 5.9 % 4.6 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales U.S. currency 14 % 13 % (1 )% Local currency 6 % 9 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 226 210 197 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 5,096 4,636 4,216 22 Table of Contents Net sales for fiscal 2008 for T.K. Maxx, operating in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany, increased by 19% over fiscal 2007, with approximately 40% of this growth due to currency exchange rates. T.K. Maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 6% (in local currency) for fiscal 2008. Same store sales for home fashions, footwear, accessories and dresses performed above the chain average, while other apparel categories were generally below the chain average. Segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16% to $127.2 million, while segment margin decreased slightly to 5.7% compared to fiscal 2007. Currency exchange rates favorably impacted segment profit by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2008, but did not impact the segment profit margin. During fiscal 2008, T.K. Maxx opened its first 5 stores in Germany which reduced segment profit for fiscal 2008 by $11 million and reduced the fiscal 2008 segment margin by 0.6 percentage points. The T.K. Maxx stores in the U.K. and Ireland increased segment margin for fiscal 2008 by 0.4 percentage points, which reflected a slightly improved merchandise margin, as well as the favorable impact of same store sales growth on expense ratios and the divisions cost containment efforts. Segment profit margin improved to 5.9% of sales for fiscal 2007 compared to 4.6% for fiscal 2006. The 1.3 percentage point improvement was due to merchandise margin, which was up 0.9 percentage points (primarily due to lower markdowns), as well as expense leverage from the 9% same store sales increase. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent, utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store relocations. We added a net of 16 T.K. Maxx stores, including 5 in Germany, in fiscal 2008 and increased the divisions selling square footage by 10%. In fiscal 2009, we plan to open a net of 15 T.K. Maxx stores, including another 5 in Germany and expect to introduce the HomeSense concept in Europe with a planned opening of 5 such stores. Overall we expect to expand selling square footage by 9%. HOMEGOODS: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 1,480.4 $ 1,365.1 $ 1,186.9 Segment profit $ 76.2 $ 60.9 $ 28.4 Segment profit as a % of net sales 5.1 % 4.5 % 2.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 3 % 4 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period 289 270 251 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 5,569 5,181 4,859 HomeGoods net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8% compared to fiscal 2007, and same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin of 5.1% for fiscal 2008 improved over fiscal 2007 primarily due to improved merchandise margins and the leveraging of expenses, particularly occupancy costs. These segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. We attribute this divisions strong performance to solid execution of off price buying and flow of product. HomeGoods same store sales grew 4% in fiscal 2007 due to strong growth in giftware and home decorative products. Segment profit increased to $60.9 million from $28.4 million, and segment profit margin almost doubled to 4.5% of sales. The increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from leveraging expenses across most categories, most notably in distribution center and occupancy expenses. We opened a net of 19 HomeGoods stores in fiscal 2008, a 7% increase, and increased selling square footage of the division by 7%. In fiscal 2009, we plan to add a net of 25 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 9%. A.J.

The operating results of the stores classified as discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were immaterial. ** Stores in operation and square footage for fiscal 2006 have been adjusted for store closings accounted for as discontinued operations. A.J. Wrights net sales increased 5% for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. A.J. Wrights same store sales increased 2% for fiscal 2008, and segment loss for fiscal 2008 was $1.8 million compared to $10.3 million for fiscal 2007. This improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise margin, a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives. A.J. Wrights same store sales increased 3% for fiscal 2007, and segment loss for fiscal 2007 increased to $10.3 million. This decline, compared to fiscal 2006, was primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise margin (1.2 percentage points) due to markdowns on below plan sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of a plan to reposition this business, we identified 34 underperforming A.J. Wright stores for closing, virtually all of which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end. The cost to close these stores and their historical operating results are presented as discontinued operations. By closing these marginally profitable stores, we reduced the number of advertising markets in which A.J. Wright operates enabling better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater efficiencies in store operations and logistics. The store closings also allowed management to focus their attention and resources on the remaining, better performing stores. We currently plan to add a net of 5 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2009. We continue to believe that A.J. Wright can be a growth vehicle for TJX, with its very sizable target customer demographic.

Bobs Stores segment loss for fiscal 2008 was flat compared to the prior year. Merchandise margin increases were driven by improved markon, the result of better buying, which more than offset increases in promotional markdowns as we significantly increased the level of promotions in this division. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $8 million. The impairment charge related to certain long lived assets and intangible assets at Bobs Stores and represented the excess of recorded carrying values over the estimated fair value of these assets. For fiscal 2009, we do not plan to open any new stores for this division as we continue to evaluate this business. GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 General corporate expense $ 139.4 $ 136.4 $ 134.1 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. This item includes the costs of the corporate office, including the compensation and benefits (including stock based compensation) for senior corporate management; payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting, internal audit, compliance, treasury, investor relations, tax, risk management, legal, human resources and systems; and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff. In addition, general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions. General corporate expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support costs in fiscal 2008 and a $5 million charge in fiscal 2007 relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other termination benefits at the corporate level. In comparing general corporate expense for fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007 included the $5 million charge referred to above, while fiscal 2006 included costs of $9 million associated with executive resignation agreements and $6 million of 24 Table of Contents costs to exit the e commerce business. The increase in other general corporate expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in corporate payroll, corporate marketing and consulting costs, charitable contributions, and European expansion costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,361.1 million in fiscal 2008, $1,195.0 million in fiscal 2007 and $1,158.0 million in fiscal 2006. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by $166.1 million. Net income (adjusted for depreciation and amortization) for fiscal 2008 increased $50.0 million. The change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year end levels was a significant component of operating cash flows. In fiscal 2008, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, favorably impacted operating cash flows by $4.9 million compared to a use of cash of $151.2 million in fiscal 2007. Additionally, fiscal 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the change in income taxes payable. These increases in fiscal 2008 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2007 were offset by the unfavorable cash flow impact of the deferred income tax provision, changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and changes in accounts receivable. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by $37.0 million compared to fiscal 2006, driven by an increase in net income (adjusted for depreciation and amortization) of $86.4 million. In fiscal 2007, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $151.2 million compared to a source of cash of $26.2 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows were also reduced by higher income tax payments. These reductions in fiscal 2007 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2006 were offset by the favorable cash flow impact of changes in deferred income taxes, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. The variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period. Average per store inventories at January 26, 2008, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, increased 2% compared to an increase of 7% at January 27, 2007. This compares to inventories per store at January 28, 2006 that were down 11% compared to the prior year. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of our A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to the consolidated financial statements) as well as leases of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January In thousands 2008 2007 2006 Balance at beginning of year $ 57,677 $ 14,981 $ 12,365 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings 61,968 Other lease related obligations 1,555 8,509 Interest accretion 1,820 400 400 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (11,214 ) (1,696 ) (6,111 ) Fixed asset write off (non cash) (18,732 ) Termination benefits and all other (2,207 ) (799 ) (182 ) Balance at end of year $ 46,076 $ 57,677 $ 14,981 The exit costs related to 34 of our A.J. Wright stores resulted in an addition to the reserve of $62 million in fiscal 2007. The other additions to the reserve for lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are the result of periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and are offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 relate primarily to our former businesses. The fixed asset write offs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 relate primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores, virtually all of which were closed at the end of fiscal 2007. 25 Table of Contents Approximately $32 million of the fiscal 2008 reserve balance and $43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations. At January 26, 2008, substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved. The actual net cost of A.J. Wright lease obligations may differ from our original estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJs Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, for which BJs Wholesale Club is primarily liable. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of BJs Wholesale Club. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJs Wholesale Club leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, to be approximately $105 million as of January 26, 2008. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2008 2007 2006 New stores $ 120.7 $ 123.0 $ 171.9 Store renovations and improvements 269.8 190.2 267.1 Office and distribution centers 136.5 64.8 56.9 Capital expenditures $ 527.0 $ 378.0 $ 495.9 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $575 million for fiscal 2009, which we expect to pay through internally generated funds. This includes $140 million for new stores, $288 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $147 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores, particularly T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and T.K. Maxx. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $952.7 million in fiscal 2008, $418.0 million in fiscal 2007 and $503.7 million in fiscal 2006. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. 26 Table of Contents We spent $950.2 million in fiscal 2008, $557.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $600.0 million in fiscal 2006 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008, 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007 and 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2006. All shares repurchased were retired. Repurchases were suspended late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and for most of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as a result of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. Of the $950.2 million of repurchases made during fiscal 2008, $436.2 million completed a $1 billion stock repurchase program initially authorized in October 2005 and $514.0 million were made under the $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized in January 2007. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an additional multi year stock repurchase plan of $1 billion. In January 2006, we entered into a C$235 million term credit facility (through our Canadian division, Winners) due in January 2010. This debt is guaranteed by TJX. Interest is payable on borrowings under this facility at rates equal to or less than Canadian prime rate. Winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively established a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.5% on this debt. The proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian division as well as other general corporate purposes of this division. Financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of $100 million in fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, there were no scheduled principal payments on long term debt. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008, $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007 and $0.24 per share in fiscal 2006. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $151.5 million in fiscal 2008, $122.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $105.3 million in fiscal 2006. Financing activities also included proceeds of $134.1 million in fiscal 2008, $260.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $102.4 million in fiscal 2006 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. In fiscal 2007, we amended our $500 million, four year revolving credit facility and our $500 million, five year revolving credit facility (initially entered into in fiscal 2006), to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until May 2010 and May 2011, respectively. These agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. We also have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we issue commercial paper from time to time. The revolving credit facilities are used as back up to our commercial paper program. As of January 26, 2008, there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. There were no borrowings on our credit facilities during fiscal 2008. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $205 million during fiscal 2007 and $567 million during fiscal 2006. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short term borrowings was 5.35% in fiscal 2007 and 3.69% in fiscal 2006. As of January 26, 2008 and January 27, 2007, Winners had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line for operating expenses was C$5.7 million in fiscal 2008, C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007 and C$4.6 million in fiscal 2006, and there were no amounts outstanding on either of these lines at the end of fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. As of January 26, 2008, T.K. Maxx had credit lines totaling 20 million. The maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2008 was 16.4 million, and there were no outstanding borrowings at January 26, 2008 or January 27, 2007. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and available financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 26, 2008, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations including estimated interest $ 928,130 $ 26,840 $ 459,960 $ $ 441,330 Operating lease commitments 5,661,698 943,174 1,707,955 1,295,248 1,715,321 Capital lease obligations 30,071 3,726 7,452 7,809 11,084 Purchase obligations 2,074,958 1,992,773 78,335 2,150 1,700 Total Obligations $ 8,694,857 $ 2,966,513 $ 2,253,702 $ 1,305,207 $ 2,169,435 27 Table of Contents The long term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 26, 2008. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay. These costs were approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2008. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities which include $125.4 million for employee compensation and benefits, most of which will come due beyond five years, derivative contracts of approximately $143.1 million, the majority of which come due in fiscal 2010, $150.5 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and $269.2 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Bobs Stores, the value oriented retailer we acquired in December 2003, does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met. These arrangements may have some impact on Bobs Stores inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results. Impairment of long lived assets: We review the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable. Significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores and our business units and involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If it is determined that an impairment of long lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of 28 Table of Contents retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. We have made contributions of $65 million, which exceeded the minimum required, over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan. Casualty insurance: In July 2007 we entered into a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Our casualty insurance program prior to 2007 requires us to estimate the total claims we will incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgements and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2008 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2008 pre tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $26.4 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 26, 2008. Accounting for taxes: Like many large corporations, we are regularly under audit by United States federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes. In evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions, we accrue charges for possible exposures. Based on the annual evaluations of tax positions, we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted. The Internal Revenue Service has examined the fiscal years ended January 2000 through January 2003 and several refund claims have been approved by IRS Appeals Office and are awaiting confirmation by the Congressional Joint Tax Committee. We also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note B and Note L to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the managements discussion and analysis, we have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make numerous estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims, litigation and investigations and the related costs and expenses we will incur. We make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims, litigation and investigation and related costs and expenses. The leases relating to discontinued operations are long term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease, the extent to which an assignee or subtenant will assume our obligation under the leases, amounts of subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist with regard to any liability. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our current reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and such differences could be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions. Loss Contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose fair value measurements according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding fair value measurements in one of the categories (level 3), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category 29 Table of Contents of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and will be applied prospectively. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that will (1) partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and (2) remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different fair value measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years and will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not believe that SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx) operations. As more fully described in Notes A and E to the consolidated financial statements, we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations; intercompany transactions with these operations; and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations; with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures; most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders equity. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of January 26, 2008, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by TJX. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during fiscal 2008. As of January 26, 2008, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Market Risk The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility. As such it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investments will occur in the near term and such changes could affect the amounts reported.
