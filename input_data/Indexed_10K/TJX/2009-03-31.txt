ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 53 week fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), and the fiscal years ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008) and January 27, 2007 (fiscal 2007), each of which included 52 weeks. Our results reflect two discontinued operations: Bobs Stores, sold in fiscal 2009 and 34 A.J. Wright stores closed in fiscal 2007 as part of a repositioning of the chain. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements. All references in the following discussion are to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. Our results reflect the costs of the unauthorized intrusion or intrusions (collectively, the Computer Intrusion) into portions of our computer system, which was discovered in late fiscal 2007 and in which we believe customer data were stolen. See Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs below. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our fiscal 2009 performance was adversely affected in the second half of the year by two macroeconomic factors: the worldwide recession which adversely affected consumer spending and retail sales at TJX and generally and the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and the British pound, which adversely affected the translation of the operating results of our Canadian and European businesses. With the flexibility of our off price business model, in fiscal 2009 we increased our inventory turns and maintained the value proposition of our merchandise by buying closer to need and operating with leaner than usual inventories. We also continued a focus on tight expense control during fiscal 2009. Despite the challenging environment, customer traffic in fiscal 2009 was up across virtually all of our divisions, and merchandise margins remained strong. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2009 include the following: Net sales for fiscal 2009 were $19.0 billion, a 4% increase over fiscal 2008. The 53rd week in fiscal 2009 increased net sales by approximately 1%, which was more than offset by a 2% decline in net sales due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We continued to grow our business, with both stores in operation and selling square footage up 5% at the end of fiscal 2009 compared to last fiscal year end. Same store sales on a 52 week basis for fiscal 2009 increased 1% over the prior year. Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2009 increased 0.3 percentage points, as an increase in merchandise margins and the benefit of the 53rd week were more than offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage on a 1% same store sales increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2009 increased by 0.1 percentage points compared to the prior year, primarily due to deleverage on the 1% same store sales increase. Our fiscal 2009 pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) was 7.6% compared to 6.9% for fiscal 2008. The comparison of pre tax margins for fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 was affected by the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in each year. Fiscal 2009 included a $31 million credit (pre tax) to the provision, which increased pre tax margin by 0.2 percentage points, while fiscal 2008 included a pre tax charge of $197 million, which reduced the fiscal 2008 pre tax margin by 1.1 percentage points. Income from continuing operations was $914.9 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009 compared to $782.4 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, last year. The fiscal 2009 credit to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs increased fiscal 2009 income from continuing operations by $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, while the fiscal 2008 charge for the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs reduced fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations by $119 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 24.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $741 million. Our diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of our stock repurchase program. Consolidated average per store inventories of our continuing operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 6% at the end of fiscal 2009 as compared to an increase of 2% at the prior year 22 Table of Contents end. On a comparable basis, adjusting for currency and a calendar shift due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2009, average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and were essentially flat in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. We have implemented steps to position ourselves for the fiscal year ending January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010) in light of the ongoing worldwide recession including: We have planned our consolidated same store sales conservatively, setting our inventory and expense plans around negative low single digit comparable store sales. We plan to continue to operate with historically lean inventories and to buy closer to need than in the past, designed to increase inventory turns and drive traffic to our stores. We are taking measures designed to reduce expenses in fiscal 2010 by up to $150 million including further savings in non merchandise procurement, implementing processes to more efficiently manage payroll in our store and distribution centers, reducing marketing expenditures while increasing penetration, eliminating open positions, eliminating merit pay increases across the majority of the organization, restructuring certain areas to improve productivity and efficiency and offering a voluntary retirement program for certain employees. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 totaled $19.0 billion, a 4% increase over net sales of $18.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 1% increase from the 53rd week and a 1% increase in same store sales, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 7% over net sales of $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase reflected increases of 3% from new stores, 2% from same store sales and a 2% favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rates. New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 5% in fiscal 2009 and by 4% in fiscal 2008 over the respective prior year periods. As a result of economic conditions, we have planned store openings more conservatively and expect to add 64 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal 2010, a 2% increase in our consolidated store base and an increase of 2% in our selling square footage. The 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a strong first half performance, especially at our international segments, partially offset by same store sales decreases in the second half of the year largely due to the economic recession. Customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in fiscal 2009, even in the third and fourth quarters, which was partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average transaction. As for merchandise categories, shoes, accessories and dresses were the strongest performers, while home fashions were adversely affected by the weak housing market and economic conditions. Geographically, same store sales in Canada and the United Kingdom were above the consolidated average for fiscal 2009, while in the U.S., same store sales in the West Coast and Florida trailed the consolidated average. The 2% increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven by a strong performance at our international segments. In the U.S., sales of dresses, footwear and accessories were strong, partially offset by softer sales in the balance of the womens apparel category. At Marmaxx, our largest business, home categories were also weak. Same store sales increases benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in Marshalls. During fiscal 2008, we opened expanded footwear departments in approximately 240 additional Marshalls stores. Same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our international segments were above the consolidated average. Within the U. S., the strongest regions were the West Coast and the Northeast, while Florida and the Southeast trailed the U.S. average. Overall transaction volume was slightly down in fiscal 2008, more than offset by an increase in the value of the average transaction. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is 23 Table of Contents closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis, which removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and we believe it is a more accurate measure of the divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 75.8 75.5 75.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.7 16.6 16.7 Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs (0.2 ) 1.1 Interest (income) expense, net 0.1 0.1 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes* 7.6 % 6.9 % 7.4 % * Due to rounding, the individual items may not foot to Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two of the more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us are as follows: Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of our stores in Canada and Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, income from continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates each period. Inventory hedges: Additionally, we routinely enter into inventory related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our international divisions purchase goods in currencies that are not their local currencies, primarily U.S. dollar purchases. As we have not elected hedge accounting as defined by SFAS No. 133 (Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities), under generally accepted accounting principles we record a mark to market adjustment on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period, prior to the currency gain or loss being recorded on the items being hedged. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the hedges are effectively offset when the related inventory is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates, as there were in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009. Historically, the impact on a full year basis has not been material. Since the mark to market adjustment on these hedges has no impact on net sales, it affects both our operating margins and earnings growth. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 75.8% in fiscal 2009, 75.5% in fiscal 2008 and 75.8% in fiscal 2007. This ratio for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, increased 0.3 percentage points primarily due to deleverage of buying and occupancy costs on the 1% same store sales increase. This deleverage more than offset a benefit to this expense ratio due to the 53rd week (estimated at approximately 0.2 percentage points) as well as an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 0.2 percentage points. Throughout fiscal 2009, we solidly executed our off price fundamentals, buying close to need, operating with leaner inventories and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin (0.4 percentage points), due to improved markon and lower markdowns. Throughout fiscal 2008, we solidly executed our off price fundamentals, buying close to need and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. This merchandise margin improvement was 24 Table of Contents partially offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. All other buying and occupancy costs remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.7% in fiscal 2009, 16.6% in fiscal 2008 and 16.7% in fiscal 2007. The increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 reflects deleverage from the low same store sales increase, primarily in store payroll and field costs, partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives. Advertising costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were essentially flat to the prior year. The fiscal 2008 expense ratio was slightly down compared to the prior year with a planned increase in advertising costs (0.1 percentage point) being offset by cost containment initiatives. Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: From the time of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion late in fiscal 2007, through the end of fiscal 2009, we cumulatively expensed $171.5 million (pre tax) with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including a net charge of $159.2 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable losses, costs of $42.8 million incurred prior to establishment of the reserve ($5 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2007) and a $30.5 million reduction in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations, settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated losses. Costs relating to the Computer Intrusion incurred and paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the reserve, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our balance sheet. As of January 31, 2009, our reserve balance was $42.2 million, which reflects our current estimation of remaining probable losses (in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including litigation, proceedings, investigations and other claims, as well as legal, monitoring, reporting and other costs. As an estimate, our reserve is subject to uncertainty, our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for developments in the course and resolution of litigation, claims and investigations and related expenses and receipt of insurance proceeds and for other changes. Interest (income) expense, net: Interest (income) expense, net amounted to expense of $14.3 million for fiscal 2009, income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008 and expense of $15.6 million for fiscal 2007. The changes from year to year relate primarily to interest income which totaled $22.2 million in fiscal 2009, $40.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $23.6 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, we generated more interest income due to higher cash balances available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 36.9% in fiscal 2009, 37.9% in fiscal 2008 and 37.7% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 reflects the favorable impact of a $19 million reduction in the FIN 48 tax liability, which reduced the annual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 by 1.3 percentage points. This improvement in the annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was offset by the absence of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of 0.4 percentage points relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico subsidiary. See Note J to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007 one time benefits as well as an increase due to certain FIN 48 tax positions, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased income at our foreign operations and increased foreign tax credits relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico subsidiary. Income from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $914.9 million in fiscal 2009, $782.4 million in fiscal 2008 and $787.2 million in fiscal 2007. Income from continuing operations per share was $2.08 in fiscal 2009, $1.68 in fiscal 2008 and $1.65 in fiscal 2007. Unlike many companies in the retail industry, we did not have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007, but did have a 53rd week in fiscal 2009. We estimate the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share by $0.09 per share. 25 Table of Contents The reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations by approximately $18 million, after tax, or $0.04 per share. The charge relating to the Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2008, adversely affected income from continuing operations by approximately $119 million, after tax, or $0.25 per share. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Changes in currency rates reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per share in fiscal 2009 as compared to an increase of $0.01 per share in fiscal 2008. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased fiscal 2008 earnings per share by $0.05 per share in comparison to fiscal 2007. In addition, our share repurchase program affects the comparability of earnings per share. We repurchased 24.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009; we repurchased 33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2008; and we repurchased 22.0 million shares at a cost of $557 million in fiscal 2007. Discontinued operations and net income: All historical income statements have been adjusted to reflect the sale of Bobs Stores in fiscal 2009 and the closure of 34 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2007 as discontinued operations. Including the impact of discontinued operations, net income was $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009, $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share, for fiscal 2008 and $738.0 million, or $1.55 per share, for fiscal 2007. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. In the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and HomeGoods and A.J. Wright each is reported as a separate segment. TJXs stores operated in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are reported as the Canadian segment, and TJXs stores operated in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the European segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs and interest. Segment profit or loss, as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: Marmaxx: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 12,362.1 $ 11,966.7 $ 11,531.8 Segment profit $ 1,155.8 $ 1,158.2 $ 1,079.3 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 9.3 % 9.7 % 9.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 0 % 1 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J. Maxx 874 847 821 Marshalls 806 776 748 Total Marmaxx 1,680 1,623 1,569 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.J. Maxx 20,543 20,025 19,390 Marshalls 20,388 19,759 19,078 Total Marmaxx 40,931 39,784 38,468 Net sales at Marmaxx increased 3% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Same store sales for Marmaxx were flat in fiscal 2009 compared to a 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2008. Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2009 reflected increased customer traffic offset by a decrease in the value of the average transaction. Categories that posted same store sales increases included footwear and accessories, childrens clothing and dresses. During fiscal 2009, we added expanded footwear departments to approximately 220 Marshalls stores, which nearly completes the expansion of footwear departments at Marshalls. Home categories at Marmaxx reported same 26 Table of Contents store sales decreases in fiscal 2009. Geographically in fiscal 2009, same store sales in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid Atlantic regions were above the chain average, while same store sales in the West Coast, Florida and the Southeast were below the chain average. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (segment margin or segment profit margin) decreased to 9.3% in fiscal 2009 from 9.7% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin was negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales (0.5 percentage points) due to deleverage on the flat same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin (0.1 percentage point) due to increased markon. As of January 31, 2009, average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at distribution centers, were down 4% compared to a 2% decrease at the prior year end. The decreases in average inventories were primarily due to continued focus on maintaining a liquid inventory position. Segment margin for fiscal 2008 increased to 9.7% compared to 9.4% in fiscal 2007. Segment margin was favorably impacted by merchandise margins, which increased 0.4 percentage points (as a percentage of net sales) due to lower markdowns and a higher markon, as well as some expense leverage due to our cost containment measures. These improvements in segment margin were partly offset by an increase in occupancy costs and a planned increase in advertising expense. We expect to open approximately 17 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2010, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 1% and increasing its selling square footage by 1%. Canada: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 2,139.4 $ 2,040.8 $ 1,740.8 Segment profit $ 236.1 $ 235.1 $ 181.9 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 11.0 % 11.5 % 10.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 3 % 5 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 202 191 184 HomeSense 75 71 68 Total 277 262 252 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,647 4,389 4,214 HomeSense 1,437 1,358 1,280 Total 6,084 5,747 5,494 Net sales for the Canadian segment for fiscal 2009 increased by 5% over fiscal 2008. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2009 sales by approximately $68 million. Same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2009 compared to a strong increase of 5% in fiscal 2008. Same store sales of outerwear, footwear, jewelry and accessories were above the segment average, while HomeSense same store sales were below the segment average for fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to $236 million compared to $235 million in fiscal 2008, while segment margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 11.0%. Currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by $11 million for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. However, because currency translation impacts both sales and expenses, it has little or no impact on segment margin. In addition, the mark to market adjustment of inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2009 by $1 million, in contrast to a $5 million benefit of the mark to market adjustment of inventory related hedges in fiscal 2008 which adversely impacted segment margin comparisons by 0.3 percentage points. Segment margin for fiscal 2009, reflected increases in distribution center costs and store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Winners opened 2 StyleSense stores, a new concept that offers family footwear and accessories. We anticipate that merchandise margins in the Canadian segment will also decline in fiscal 2010 as a result of foreign 27 Table of Contents currency exchange, due to the high volume of merchandise purchases by the Canadian segment denominated in U.S. dollars. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased 1.1 percentage points to 11.5% compared to 10.4% for fiscal 2007. This improvement in segment margin was primarily due to improved expense ratios (leverage from the 5% same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives). Currency exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately $24 million for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Most of this increase was due to currency translation, and as a result, it had no impact on segment margin. The increase in segment profit in fiscal 2008 also included the favorable impact of a mark to market adjustment of inventory hedge contracts, which increased segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. The fiscal 2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in merchandise margin, primarily due to increased markon as well as the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and strong same store sales results on expense ratios. We expect to add a net of 13 stores in Canada in fiscal 2010, which is an increase of 5% and will increase selling square footage by 5%. Europe: Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 2,242.1 $ 2,216.2 $ 1,864.5 Segment profit $ 137.6 $ 127.2 $ 109.3 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 6.1 % 5.7 % 5.9 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 6 % 9 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K. Maxx 235 226 210 HomeSense 7 Total 242 226 210 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.K. Maxx 5,404 5,096 4,636 HomeSense 107 Total 5,511 5,096 4,636 European net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 1% to $2.2 billion compared to fiscal 2008. Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected fiscal 2009 sales by approximately $282 million. Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 compared to a 6% increase last year. Same store sales for footwear and accessories and most other womens apparel categories performed above the chain average, while home fashions were below the chain average. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8% to $137.6 million, and segment margin increased 0.4 percentage points to 6.1% compared to last year. Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment profit by approximately $26 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in segment margin reflects improved merchandise margins, partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales and the cost of operations in Germany. We are encouraged by the performance of our German stores but as they are new stores, they reduce the segment margin generated by the more established stores in the U.K. and Ireland. During fiscal 2009, T.K. Maxx added 4 more stores in Germany, following the opening of its first 5 stores in Germany in fiscal 2008. T.K. Maxx also introduced the HomeSense concept into the U.K. with 7 new stores. Segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16% to $127.2 million, while segment margin decreased slightly to 5.7% compared to fiscal 2007. Currency exchange rate translation favorably impacted segment profit by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2008, but did not impact the segment profit margin. The opening of 5 stores in Germany reduced segment profit for fiscal 2008 by $11 million and reduced the fiscal 2008 segment margin by 0.6 percentage points, offsetting the slightly improved merchandise margin in the remainder of the segment, as well as the favorable impact of same store sales growth on expense ratios and the segments cost containment initiatives. 28 Table of Contents In fiscal 2010, we plan to open a net of 17 T.K. Maxx stores, including 10 in Germany and 3 HomeSense stores in the U.K. and to expand selling square footage by 8%. HomeGoods: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 1,578.3 $ 1,480.4 $ 1,365.1 Segment profit $ 42.4 $ 76.2 $ 60.9 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 2.7 % 5.1 % 4.5 % Percent (decrease) increase in same store sales (3 )% 3 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 318 289 270 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 6,248 5,569 5,181 HomeGoods net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7% compared to fiscal 2008, and same store sales decreased 3% in fiscal 2009. Sales of home fashions have been particularly impacted by the weak housing market and recession. Segment margin of 2.7% was down from 5.1% for fiscal 2008. Merchandise margins declined in fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased markdowns. In addition, HomeGoods experienced deleverage on operating costs as a result of the decline in same store sales. We are seeking to address the difficult home environment by operating with very lean inventories and focusing on merchandise categories that we believe will resonate with consumers in these difficult times. HomeGoods net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8% compared to fiscal 2007, and same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin of 5.1% for fiscal 2008 improved over fiscal 2007, primarily due to improved merchandise margins and the leveraging of expenses, particularly occupancy costs. These segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. In fiscal 2010, we plan to add a net of 4 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 1%. A.J. Wright: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 677.6 $ 632.7 $ 601.8 Segment profit (loss) $ 2.9 $ (1.8 ) $ (10.3 ) Segment profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales 0.4 % (0.3 )% (1.7 )% Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 2 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 135 129 129 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,680 2,576 2,577 A.J.

Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 and A.J. Wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal 2009 compared to losses in the prior years. We believe A.J. Wright has improved its results through better merchandising and advertising effectiveness, as a result of our improved understanding of A.J. Wrights customer tastes and spending habits. A.J. Wrights net sales increased 5% for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. A.J. Wrights same store sales increased 2% for fiscal 2008, and segment loss for fiscal 2008 was $1.8 million compared to $10.3 million for fiscal 2007. This improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise margin, a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives. As a result of A.J. Wrights improved results, we plan to increase the rate of store openings for this chain for fiscal 2010, currently planning to add a net of 13 A.J. Wright stores and increase selling square footage by 10%. 29 Table of Contents General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 General corporate expense $ 140.0 $ 139.4 $ 136.4 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes is those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. General corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was virtually flat. The comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support costs in fiscal 2008 and a $5 million charge in fiscal 2007 relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other termination benefits at the corporate level. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,155 million in fiscal 2009, $1,375 million in fiscal 2008, and $1,213 million in fiscal 2007. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by $220 million as compared to the prior year. Net income, after adjusting for the non cash impact of depreciation and the sale of Bobs Stores assets of $31 million in fiscal 2009 (including the benefit of the 53rd week), provided cash of $1,314 million, an increase of $173 million from the adjusted $1,141 million in fiscal 2008. The change in deferred income taxes favorably impacted cash flows in fiscal 2009 by $132 million, while last years deferred income taxes reduced cash flows by $102 million. Deferred taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the non cash tax benefit of $47 million relating to the establishment of the Computer Intrusion reserve. The favorable impact on deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax treatment of payments against the Computer Intrusion reserve and favorable impact of tax depreciation. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable offset the favorable changes in cash flows in fiscal 2009, as it resulted in a use of cash of $210 million in fiscal 2009, compared to a source of cash of $5 million last year. The change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a timing difference in the payment of our accounts payable due to change in our buying pattern. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $35 million in fiscal 2009 versus a source of cash of $203 million in fiscal 2008. Last year, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflected $117 million for the pre tax reserve established for the Computer Intrusion, which favorably impacted cash flows, while fiscal 2009s cash flows were reduced by $75 million for payments against and adjustments to the reserve. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable reduced cash in fiscal 2009 by $49 million compared to an increase of $56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in prepaid expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an additional $65 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by $162 million over the prior year. Net income, after adjusting for the non cash impact of depreciation, for fiscal 2008 increased $50 million. The change in inventory, net of accounts payable, from prior year end levels was a significant component of operating cash flows. In fiscal 2008, the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, favorably impacted operating cash flows by $5 million compared to a use of cash of $151 million in fiscal 2007. Additionally, fiscal 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the change in income taxes payable. These increases in fiscal 2008 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2007 were offset by the unfavorable cash flow impact of the deferred income tax provision, changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and changes in accounts receivable. Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of 34 A.J. Wright stores as well as leases of former TJX businesses. In fiscal 2009, we reserved an additional $3 million for 2 Bobs Stores locations, which the buyer of Bobs 30 Table of Contents Stores has the right to put back to us and which we consider probable. This was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable settlements on several A.J. Wright locations. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January In thousands 2009 2008 2007 Balance at beginning of year $ 46,076 $ 57,677 $ 14,981 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings (2,908 ) 61,968 Other lease related obligations 2,908 1,555 Interest accretion 1,820 1,820 400 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (7,323 ) (11,214 ) (1,696 ) Fixed asset write off (non cash) (18,732 ) Termination benefits and all other (9 ) (2,207 ) (799 ) Balance at end of year $ 40,564 $ 46,076 $ 57,677 We added $62 million in fiscal 2007 for the exit costs related to the closing of 34 A.J. Wright stores (see Note C to our consolidated financial statements). The additions to the reserve for other lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 were the result of periodic adjustments to the estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and were offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount. The lease related charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 related primarily to our former businesses. The fixed asset write offs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all of the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, related primarily to the 34 A.J. Wright closed stores. Approximately $25 million of the fiscal 2009 reserve balance relates to the A.J. Wright store closings, primarily our estimation of lease costs, net of estimated subtenant income. Approximately $3 million of the reserve at fiscal 2009 relates to 2 Bobs Stores locations which are considered probable for being put back to TJX by the buyer. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease obligations. At January 31, 2009, substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved. The actual net cost of these lease obligations may differ from our original estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJs Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, and 8 additional Bobs Stores leases. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we do not believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us is probable. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. 31 Table of Contents We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJs Wholesale Club and Bobs Stores leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, to be approximately $100 million as of January 31, 2009. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing Activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2009 2008 2007 New stores $ 147.6 $ 120.7 $ 123.0 Store renovations and improvements 264.3 269.8 190.2 Office and distribution centers 171.0 136.5 64.8 Capital expenditures $ 582.9 $ 527.0 $ 378.0 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $450 million for fiscal 2010, which we expect to fund through internally generated funds. This includes $153 million for new stores, $182 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $115 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer planned store openings and reduced spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores. Investing activities also include cash flows associated with our net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter. The net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to $14.4 million versus net cash payments of $13.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $17.7 million in fiscal 2007. Financing Activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $769 million in fiscal 2009, $953 million in fiscal 2008 and $418 million in fiscal 2007. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program. We spent $741 million in fiscal 2009, $950 million in fiscal 2008 and $557 million in fiscal 2007 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009, 33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008 and 22.0 million shares in fiscal 2007. All shares repurchased were retired. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. Our fiscal 2009 repurchases completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in January 2007 and included the repurchase of 8.9 million shares at a cost of $255 million under the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in February 2008. As of January 31, 2009, $745 million remained available for purchase under the current program. The timing of purchases under this program is determined by TJX from time to time based on its assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity and market conditions. We are taking a more conservative approach to our stock repurchase program and currently plan to repurchase up to approximately $250 million of our stock in fiscal 2010. This timing and amount of these purchases are subject to change depending upon the economic environment and other factors. The $464.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes (which are due in February 2021) are convertible into 15.2 million shares of common stock under certain conditions, 32 Table of Contents including if the closing sale price of our common stock reaches specified trigger prices. The trigger price was met during a portion of fiscal 2009 and 52,552 notes were converted during fiscal 2009, resulting in the issuance of 1.7 million shares of common stock. The notes were not convertible during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 because our stock price did not meet the trigger prices during relevant periods. The trigger prices will have to be met during applicable future periods for the notes to be convertible in future quarters. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009, $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008 and $0.28 per share in fiscal 2007. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $177 million in fiscal 2009, $151 million in fiscal 2008 and $123 million in fiscal 2007. Financing activities also included proceeds of $142 million in fiscal 2009, $134 million in fiscal 2008 and $260 million in fiscal 2007 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. We have a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2011. These agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 31, 2009 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $222 million during fiscal 2009. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short term borrowings was 3.92% in fiscal 2009. There were no borrowings on our credit facilities during fiscal 2008. As of January 31, 2009 and January 26, 2008, Winners had two credit lines, one for C$10 million for operating expenses and one C$10 million letter of credit facility. Winners did not borrow under the credit line for operating expenses in fiscal 2009. The maximum amount outstanding under our Canadian credit line for operating expenses was C$5.7 million in fiscal 2008 and C$3.8 million in fiscal 2007. There were no amounts outstanding on this line at the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. As of January 31, 2009, T.K. Maxx had a credit line of 20 million. The maximum amount outstanding was 6.1 million in fiscal 2009 and 16.4 million in fiscal 2008. There were no outstanding borrowings on this credit line at the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating, debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and other financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 31, 2009, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 806,654 $ 410,125 $ $ 396,529 $ Operating lease commitments 5,071,283 913,446 1,582,397 1,137,941 1,437,499 Capital lease obligation 26,671 3,726 7,623 7,824 7,498 Purchase obligations 1,922,537 1,803,500 112,204 4,635 2,198 Total Obligations $ 7,827,145 $ 3,130,797 $ 1,702,224 $ 1,546,929 $ 1,447,195 The long term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014. If none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted, the notes will mature in fiscal 2022. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of January 31, 2009. 33 Table of Contents The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales, which together were approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities which include $272.9 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $137.9 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and $240.6 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. We believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained, had alternative assumptions been selected, would not be materially different from the results we have reported. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of the inventory. Our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors. Impairment of long lived assets: We review the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable. Significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores and our business units and involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If it is determined that an impairment of long lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. The market performance on plan assets during fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return and as a result the 34 Table of Contents unfunded status of our qualified plan increased significantly. Despite this we were not required to fund our plan during fiscal 2009, primarily due to voluntary funding in prior years. As of the date of this report we have funded $50 million into the qualified pension plan and may make additional voluntary contributions during fiscal 2010. Share based compensation: In accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) TJX estimates the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under its stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as stock compensation cost over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black Scholes method for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related expense. Casualty insurance: In July 2007, we entered into a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Our casualty insurance program prior to 2007 required us to estimate the total claims we will incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates. If our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2009 were to change by 10%, the fiscal 2009 pre tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $2 million. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $20.8 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 31, 2009. Income taxes: Like many large corporations, our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposures when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However, it is possible that the actual results of proceedings with tax authorities and in courts, changes in facts, expiration of statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions will differ from the amounts we have accrued in either a positive or a negative manner, which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note B and Note M to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Managements Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims, litigation and investigations and costs and expenses we will incur. We make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims, litigation and investigation and the amount of such costs and expenses. The leases relating to discontinued operations are long term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease the extent to which an assignee or subtenant will assume our obligations under the leases, amounts of subtenant income, how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our current reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and such differences could be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions. 35 Table of Contents Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian (Winners and HomeSense) and European (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) operations and on the translation of these foreign operations into the U. S. dollar. As more fully described in Notes A and E to the consolidated financial statements to the Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, we hedge a significant portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations, with derivative financial instruments. During fiscal 2009 we ceased hedging our net investment position in our foreign operations. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 31, 2009, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre tax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 by approximately $37 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding. As of January 31, 2009, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 36 Table of Contents EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which is invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility. As a result of the significant decline in the capital markets in 2009 the value of our pension plan assets decreased substantially increasing the unfunded status of our plan and reducing shareholders equity on our balance sheet.
