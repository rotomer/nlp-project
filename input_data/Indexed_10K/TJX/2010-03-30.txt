ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 52 week fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), the 53 week fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009) and the 52 week fiscal year ended January 26, 2008 (fiscal 2008). Like most retailers we have a 53 week fiscal period every five to six years. This extra week of sales volume, which also provides a lift to pre tax margins due to the flow of certain monthly and annual expenses, impacts comparisons to other fiscal periods. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We entered fiscal 2010 faced with the challenges of a worldwide recession and established a three pronged strategy for managing through the challenging economic times: conservatively plan same store sales, allowing better flow through to the bottom line if we exceed plans; run with very lean inventories and buy closer to need than in the past, increasing inventory turns and protecting gross margins; and focus on cost cutting measures and controlling expenses. Implementing this strategy has proven successful, and we posted results significantly above our expectations and ahead of last year on a consolidated basis and for each of our businesses. Customer traffic increased as the year progressed, driving sales. Additionally, we took advantage of opportunities the environment presented, opening more new stores than planned and adding many new vendors. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow both sales and earnings in fiscal 2011, driving market share with our value proposition and continuing the marketing, inventory management and cost reduction strategies that were successful in fiscal 2010. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2010 include the following: Same store sales for fiscal 2010 increased 6% over the prior year. Same store sales growth was driven by significant increases in customer traffic, as we attracted new customers across various income levels, and strong performance by all of our businesses. Net sales increased 7% to $20.3 billion for fiscal 2010. Stores in operation and selling square footage were both up 3% at the end of fiscal 2010 compared to last fiscal year end. Increases in consolidated same store sales and sales growth from our new stores were partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively impacted sales growth by 2 percentage points. Unlike many other retailers, we had a 53rd week in fiscal 2009, which benefited fiscal 2009 sales but negatively impacted the fiscal 2010 comparison by approximately 1 percentage point. Our fiscal 2010 pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) was 9.6% compared to 7.6% for fiscal 2009. The improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by increased merchandise margins, which were achieved as a result of managing the business with substantially lower levels of inventory. The comparison of pre tax margins for fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009 was adversely impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2009 calendar and a favorable adjustment to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009. Combined, these two items benefited the fiscal 2009 pre tax margin by approximately 0.4 percentage points. Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2010 decreased 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leverage of buying and occupancy costs on strong same store sales, partially offset by the benefit to fiscal 2009s cost of sales ratio due to the 53rd week included in fiscal 2009. The selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2010 decreased by 0.1 percentage points, with the benefit of cost reduction programs and expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2010, partially offset by a 0.5 percentage point increase due to performance based incentive compensation. Income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010 compared to $914.9 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations benefited by $0.16 per share from a number of items, which affected the year over year comparison; the 53rd week added $0.09 per share, the credit to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs added $0.04 per share and a tax related adjustment added $0.03 per share. 22 Table of Contents During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 27.0 million shares of our common stock for $950 million. This years repurchases included the use of the $375 million proceeds from our April 2009 debt offering to repurchase a majority of the 15.1 million shares issued upon conversion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes called for redemption. Diluted earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. Consolidated average per store inventories from our continuing operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were down 10% at the end of fiscal 2010 over the prior year end as compared to a decrease of 6% at the end of fiscal 2009 over the prior year end. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 totaled $20.3 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of $19.0 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase reflected a 6% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a 1% decrease from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 4% over net sales of $18.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 1% increase from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 and a 1% increase in same store sales, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 5% in fiscal 2009 over the prior fiscal year. We expect to add 130 stores (net of store closings) in fiscal 2011, a 5% increase in both our consolidated store base and our selling square footage. The 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by significant increases in customer traffic at all of our businesses, partially offset by a decline in the value of the average transaction. The increase in customer traffic accelerated during the course of the year. Juniors, dresses, childrens apparel, footwear, accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2010. Geographically, same store sales increases in Europe and Canada trailed the consolidated average. In the U.S., sales were strong throughout the country with the Midwest, Southeast and West Coast above the average, and New England and Florida below the average. The 1% same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a strong first half performance, especially at our international segments, partially offset by same store sales decreases in the second half of the year largely due to the economic recession. Customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in fiscal 2009, even in the third and fourth quarters, but was partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average transaction. As for merchandise categories, footwear, accessories and dresses were the strongest performers, while home fashions were adversely affected by the weak housing market and economic conditions. Geographically, same store sales in Canada and Europe were above the consolidated average for fiscal 2009, while in the U.S., same store sales in the West Coast and Florida trailed the consolidated average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current years same store sales of our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of divisional operating performance. 23 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 73.8 75.9 75.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.4 16.5 16.3 Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs (0.2 ) 1.1 Interest (income) expense, net 0.2 0.1 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes* 9.6 % 7.6 % 6.9 % * Due to rounding, the individual items may not foot to Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results can benefit or be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two of the more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us are as follows: Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of our stores in Canada and Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, income from continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates each period. Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our international divisions purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies (primarily U.S. dollar purchases). As we have not elected hedge accounting as defined by U.S. GAAP, we record a mark to market gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of these adjustments is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark to market adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it does affect cost of sales, operating margins and reported earnings. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 73.8% in fiscal 2010, 75.9% in fiscal 2009 and 75.7% in fiscal 2008. The improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 2.1 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the 6% same store sales increase, particularly in occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which resulted in an increase in markon, along with a reduction in markdowns compared to the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the 53rd week (approximately 0.2 percentage points). Additionally, for fiscal 2010, buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation that covers many associates across our organization. The higher accruals are the result of operating performance that was well ahead of our objectives. This ratio for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, increased 0.2 percentage points primarily due to deleverage of buying and occupancy costs on the 1% same store sales increase. This deleverage more than offset a benefit to this expense ratio due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 (approximately 0.2 percentage points) as well as an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 0.2 percentage points. Throughout fiscal 2009, we effectively executed our off price fundamentals, buying close to need, operating with leaner inventories and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.4% in fiscal 2010, 16.5% in fiscal 2009 and 16.3% in fiscal 2008. The improvement in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to levering of expenses and savings from our expense reduction initiatives. These 24 Table of Contents improvements were partially offset by the increase in performance based incentive compensation mentioned above, which had an even greater impact on selling, general and administrative expense ratio increasing it by 0.5 percentage points. The fiscal 2009 expense ratio increased slightly compared to fiscal 2008 due to deleverage from the low same store sales increase, primarily in store payroll and field costs, partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives. Advertising costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2008. Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP with respect to the Computer Intrusion. From the time of the discovery of the Computer Intrusion late in fiscal 2007, through the end of fiscal 2010, we cumulatively expensed $171.5 million (pre tax) with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including a net charge of $159.2 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable losses, costs of $42.8 million incurred prior to the establishment of the reserve ($5 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2007) and a $30.5 million reduction in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations, settlements, insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated losses. Costs relating to the Computer Intrusion incurred and paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the reserve, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our balance sheet. As of January 30, 2010, our reserve balance was $23.5 million, which reflects our current estimate of remaining probable losses with respect to the Computer Intrusion, including litigation, proceedings and other claims, as well as legal, monitoring, reporting and other costs. As an estimate, our reserve is subject to uncertainty, our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve as a result of developments in litigation and claims, related expenses, receipt of insurance proceeds and for other changes. Interest expense (income), net: Interest expense (income), net amounted to expense of $39.5 million for fiscal 2010, expense of $14.3 million for fiscal 2009 and income of $1.6 million for fiscal 2008. The components of net interest expense (income) for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in thousands 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 49,278 $ 38,123 $ 39,926 Capitalized interest (758) (1,647) (799) Interest (income) (9,011) (22,185) (40,725) Net interest expense (income) $ 39,509 $ 14,291 $ (1,598) Gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal 2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% notes issued in April 2009 and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes issued in July 2009. The 6.95% notes were issued in conjunction with the call for redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities, and we refinanced our C$235 million credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the 4.20% notes. The impact on earnings per share of the incremental interest cost of these two debt issuances was partially offset by a benefit in our earnings per share, as the majority of the 15.1 million shares issued upon conversion of the convertible notes were repurchased with the net proceeds of the 6.95% notes. On a full year basis, we expect the benefit of the share repurchase to more than offset the impact on fully diluted earnings per share from the interest on the 6.95% notes. For more information on these note offerings, see the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources. In addition, interest income for fiscal 2010 was less than fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of return on investments more than offsetting higher cash balances available for investment during fiscal 2010. The change in net interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was driven by the change in interest income. In fiscal 2008, we generated more interest income due to higher cash balances available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments. 25 Table of Contents Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 37.8% in fiscal 2010, 36.9% in fiscal 2009 and 37.9% in fiscal 2008. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable impact in fiscal 2009 of a $19 million reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement of several state tax audits. The absence of this fiscal 2009 benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 by 1.3 percentage points, partially offset by a reduction in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income. The decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 reflected a 1.3 percentage point favorable impact of a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax position. This benefit in the annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was offset by the absence of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of 0.4 percentage points relating to the tax treatment of our Puerto Rico subsidiary. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements. TJX anticipates an effective annual income tax rate of 38.0% to 38.5% for fiscal 2011. Income from continuing operations and income per share from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010, a 33% increase over the $914.9 million in fiscal 2009, which in turn was a 17% increase over the $782.4 million in fiscal 2008. Income from continuing operations per share was $2.84 in fiscal 2010, $2.08 in fiscal 2009 and $1.68 in fiscal 2008. Several items, discussed below, affected earnings per share comparisons for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. We estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share in that year by $0.09 per share. The reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 by approximately $0.04 per share. The charge relating to the Computer Intrusion related costs in fiscal 2008 adversely affected income from continuing operations in that year by $0.25 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency rates reduced earnings per share by $0.01 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a $0.01 per share benefit in fiscal 2009. When comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008, foreign currency exchange rates reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per share in fiscal 2009 compared to a $0.01 per share benefit in fiscal 2008. In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share, which are benefited by our share repurchase programs. We repurchased 27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2010; 24.0 million shares at a cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009; and 33.3 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2008. We significantly reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding from 442.3 million to 427.6 million in fiscal 2010 with the incremental purchase over those planned under our stock repurchase program by using the proceeds of our April 2009 debt offering to repurchase the majority of the 15.1 million shares issued on conversion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes following their call. Discontinued operations and net income: Fiscal 2009 and prior periods include the loss on the sale of the Bobs Stores division in discontinued operations. In addition, the operating results for Bobs Stores for all periods prior to the sale are included in discontinued operations. Including the impact of discontinued operations, net income was $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per share, for fiscal 2010, $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009 and $771.8 million, or $1.66 per share, for fiscal 2008. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. In the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and each of HomeGoods and A.J. Wright is reported as a separate segment. TJXs stores operated in Canada (Winners and HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Canada segment, and TJXs stores operated in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Europe segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense, Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs and interest. Segment profit or loss, as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from 26 Table of Contents operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 13,270.9 $ 12,362.1 $ 11,966.7 Segment profit $ 1,588.5 $ 1,155.8 $ 1,158.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 12.0 % 9.3 % 9.7 % Percent increase in same store sales 7 % 0 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 7% compared to being flat in fiscal 2009. Sales at Marmaxx for fiscal 2010 reflected significantly increased customer traffic, partially offset by a decrease in the value of the average transaction. Categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases included juniors, dresses, childrens apparel and footwear. Home categories improved significantly at Marmaxx during the year, with same store sales increases above the chain average for fiscal 2010. Geographically, there were strong trends throughout the country. Same store sales were strongest in the Midwest, West Coast and Southeast, while New England and Florida trailed the chain average for fiscal 2010. We also saw a lift in the net sales of stores renovated during the year, and we anticipate increasing our store renovation program in fiscal 2011. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (segment margin or segment profit margin) increased to 12.0% in fiscal 2010 from 9.3% in fiscal 2009. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 2.4 percentage points driven by lower markdowns and higher markon. In addition, the 7% increase in same store sales provided expense leverage on numerous costs as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of sales, primarily due to higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. Segment margin decreased to 9.3% in fiscal 2009 from 9.7% in fiscal 2008. Segment margin was negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales (0.5 percentage points) due to deleverage on the flat same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin (0.1 percentage point) due to increased markon. As of January 30, 2010, Marmaxxs average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at its distribution centers, were down 10% as compared to these inventory levels at the same time last year. Average per store inventories at January 31, 2009 were down 4% compared to those of the prior year period. As of January 30, 2010, inventory commitments (inventory on hand and merchandise on order) were essentially flat on a per store basis compared to the end of fiscal 2009. We expect to open approximately 53 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2011, increasing the Marmaxx store base by 3% and increasing its selling square footage by 3%. 27 Table of Contents HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 1,794.4 $ 1,578.3 $ 1,480.4 Segment profit $ 137.5 $ 42.4 $ 76.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 7.7 % 2.7 % 5.1 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 9 % (3) % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period 323 318 289 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 6,354 6,248 5,569 HomeGoods net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 9% in fiscal 2010, driven by significantly increased customer traffic, compared to a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2009. Segment margin of 7.7% was up significantly from 2.7% for fiscal 2009, due to increased merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 9% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory levels, which drove better off price buying and increased inventory turns. These improvements were partially offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. HomeGoods net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7% compared to fiscal 2008, and same store sales decreased 3%. Segment margin of 2.7% for fiscal 2009 was down from 5.1% for fiscal 2008. Merchandise margins declined in fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased markdowns and operating costs delevered as a result of the decline in same store sales. In fiscal 2011, we plan to add a net of 9 HomeGoods stores and increase selling square footage by 3%. A.J. Wright Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 779.8 $ 677.6 $ 632.7 Segment profit (loss) $ 12.6 $ 2.9 $ (1.8) Segment profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales 1.6 % 0.4 % (0.3) % Percent increase in same store sales 9 % 4 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period 150 135 129 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 3,012 2,680 2,576 A.J. Wrights net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, and same store sales increased 9%. A.J. Wrights improvement in sales was driven by an increasingly better understanding of its customers tastes and shopping habits, which has led to improved merchandising and marketing. Segment profit increased significantly to $12.6 million in fiscal 2010, compared to segment profit of $2.9 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved merchandise margin. Like our other divisions, cost reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense leverage on the same store sales increase was partially offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation. A.J. Wrights net sales increased 7% for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, and segment profit increased to $2.9 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million in fiscal 2008. Same store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2009 and A.J. Wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal 2009 compared to losses in the prior years. In fiscal 2011, we plan to add a net of 8 A.J. Wright stores and increase selling square footage by 6%. 28 Table of Contents International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 2,167.9 $ 2,139.4 $ 2,040.8 Segment profit $ 255.0 $ 236.1 $ 235.1 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 11.8 % 11.0 % 11.5 % Percent increase in same store sales 2 % 3 % 5 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 211 202 191 HomeSense 79 75 71 Total 290 277 262 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,847 4,647 4,389 HomeSense 1,527 1,437 1,358 Total 6,374 6,084 5,747 Net sales for TJX Canada (which includes Winners and HomeSense) increased 1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $62 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 3% in fiscal 2009. Same store sales of juniors, dresses, mens and footwear, as well as HomeSense on a standalone basis, were above the segment average for fiscal 2010. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to $255 million compared to $236 million in fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by $4 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The mark to market adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Segment margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 11.8% in fiscal 2010, compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009, which was primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins. Improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. Net sales for fiscal 2009 increased by 5% over fiscal 2008. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2009 sales by approximately $68 million. Same store sales increased 3% in fiscal 2009 compared to an increase of 5% in fiscal 2008. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to $236 million compared to $235 million in fiscal 2008, while segment margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 11.0%. Currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by $11 million for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. However, because currency translation impacts both sales and expenses, it has little or no impact on segment margin. In addition, the mark to market adjustment of inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2009 by $1 million, in contrast to a $5 million benefit in fiscal 2008, which adversely impacted segment margin comparisons by 0.3 percentage points. Segment margin for fiscal 2009 reflected increases in distribution center costs and store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins. We expect to add a net of 6 stores in Canada in fiscal 2011 and plan to increase selling square footage by 2%. 29 Table of Contents TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 2,275.4 $ 2,242.1 $ 2,216.2 Segment profit $ 164.0 $ 137.6 $ 127.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 7.2 % 6.1 % 5.7 % Percent increase in same store sales 5 % 4 % 6 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $252 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 5% for fiscal 2010 compared to a 4% increase in fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $164 million, and segment profit margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 7.2%. The increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise margins and leverage of expenses on the 5% same store sales increase, partially offset by costs of operations in Germany and Poland along with higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation. We are encouraged by the performance of our stores in Germany and Poland and our HomeSense stores in the U.K., but as newer operations, they reduce the segment margin generated by the more established T.K. Maxx stores in the U.K. and Ireland. We also invested in strengthening the shared services infrastructure for our planned European expansion. Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment profit, while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a favorable mark to market adjustment of $10 million, primarily relating to the conversion of Euros to Pound Sterling. Net sales for TJX Europe for fiscal 2009 were up 1% compared to fiscal 2008. Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected fiscal 2009 net sales by approximately $282 million. Segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8% to $137.6 million, and segment margin increased 0.4 percentage points to 6.1% compared to fiscal 2008. Currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment profit by approximately $26 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2009 reflected improved merchandise margins, partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales and the cost of operations in Germany. During fiscal 2009, T.K. Maxx added 4 more stores in Germany, following the opening of its first 5 stores in Germany in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, T.K. Maxx also introduced the HomeSense concept into the U.K. with 7 new stores. As a result of the performance of TJX Europe and the opportunity for off price retail in Europe, we intend to increase the rate of expansion in Europe. In fiscal 2011, we plan to open a net of 48 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe and a net of 6 HomeSense stores in the U.K. for a net total of 54 new stores in Europe. We also plan to expand total TJX Europe selling square footage by 16%. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 General corporate expense $ 166.4 $ 140.0 $ 139.4 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to an $18 million contribution to the 30 Table of Contents TJX Foundation in fiscal 2010 compared to no contribution in fiscal 2009. Additionally, fiscal 2010 had higher performance based incentive and benefit plan accruals as compared to fiscal 2009, which were partially offset by benefits related to hedging activity. General corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was virtually flat. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,272 million in fiscal 2010, $1,155 million in fiscal 2009 and $1,375 million in fiscal 2008. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflected the effects of the economic recession. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased $1,117 million compared to fiscal 2009. Net income provided cash of $1,214 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $333 million over net income of $881 million in fiscal 2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, provided a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009. The reduction in inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which, in turn, increased inventory turnover. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by $191 million compared to a decrease in cash of $49 million in fiscal 2009. The change in prepaid expenses and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010 cash flows of $64 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009, reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performance based incentive compensation, partially offset by increased funding of the pension plan. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the deferred income tax provision, which reduced cash flows by $79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable impact of $61 million of all other items, which primarily reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by $220 million as compared to fiscal 2008. Net income and the non cash impact of depreciation and the sale of Bobs Stores assets of $31 million in fiscal 2009 (including the benefit of the 53rd week), provided cash of $1,314 million, an increase of $173 million from the adjusted $1,141 million in fiscal 2008. The change in deferred income taxes favorably impacted cash flows in fiscal 2009 by $132 million, while last years deferred income taxes reduced cash flows by $102 million. Deferred taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the non cash tax benefit of $47 million relating to the establishment of the Computer Intrusion reserve. The favorable impact on deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax treatment of payments against the Computer Intrusion reserve and favorable impact of tax depreciation. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable offset the favorable changes in cash flows in fiscal 2009, as it resulted in a use of cash of $210 million in fiscal 2009, compared to a source of cash of $5 million in fiscal 2008. The change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a timing difference in the payment of our accounts payable due to a change in our buying pattern. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $35 million in fiscal 2009 versus a source of cash of $203 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflected $117 million for the pre tax reserve established for the Computer Intrusion, which favorably impacted cash flows, while fiscal 2009s cash flows were reduced by $75 million for payments against and adjustments to this reserve. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable reduced cash in fiscal 2009 by $49 million compared to an increase of $56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in prepaid expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an additional $65 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. 31 Table of Contents Discontinued operations reserve: We have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of 34 A.J. Wright stores in fiscal 2007, as well as certain leases of former TJX businesses. The balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below: Fiscal Year Ended January In thousands 2010 2009 2008 Balance at beginning of year $ 40,564 $ 46,076 $ 57,677 Additions to the reserve charged to net income: A.J. Wright store closings 8 (2,908 ) Other lease related obligations (8 ) 2,908 Interest accretion 1,761 1,820 1,820 Charges against the reserve: Lease related obligations (5,891 ) (7,323 ) (11,214 ) Termination benefits and all other (537 ) (9 ) (2,207 ) Balance at end of year $ 35,897 $ 40,564 $ 46,076 The charges against the reserve in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 related primarily to the closed A.J. Wright stores. In fiscal 2009, we reserved an additional $3 million for exposure to properties related to the sale of Bobs Stores, which was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable settlements on several A.J. Wright locations. The majority of the reserve relates to lease obligations with respect to the closure of the A.J. Wright stores and the sale of Bobs Stores. The remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims, updated quarterly, that have been, or we believe are likely to be, made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses, after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease obligations. The actual net cost of the various lease obligations included in the reserve may differ from our initial estimate. Although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve, and we may incur costs for other leases from former discontinued operations, we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated. We estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years. The actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled. We may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of BJs Wholesale Club and 7 additional Bobs Stores leases, both former TJX businesses. Our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases, because we currently believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us is not probable. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses for which we have reserved, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them, which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants do not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations, not reflected in our reserves, of leases of closed stores of continuing operations, BJs Wholesale Club and Bobs Stores leases discussed above, and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, to be approximately $94 million as of January 30, 2010. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. 32 Table of Contents Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2010 2009 2008 New stores $ 127.8 $ 147.6 $ 120.7 Store renovations and improvements 206.8 264.3 269.8 Office and distribution centers 94.7 171.0 136.5 Capital expenditures $ 429.3 $ 582.9 $ 527.0 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $750 million for fiscal 2011, which we expect to fund through internally generated funds. This includes $216 million for new stores, $289 million for store renovations, expansions and improvements and $245 million for our office and distribution centers. The planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to investment in systems, distribution and other infrastructure to support growth as well as an increase in planned store openings, and increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores. Investing activities for fiscal 2010 include the purchase and sale of some short term investments by TJX Canada, as excess cash was invested in funds with initial maturities greater than three months to enhance investment returns. Investing activities for fiscal 2009 and 2008 also include cash flows associated with our net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter. The net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to $14.4 million versus net cash payments of $13.7 million in fiscal 2008. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $584 million in fiscal 2010, $769 million in fiscal 2009 and $953 million in fiscal 2008. The majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase programs. Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. On April 7, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% ten year notes. Related to this transaction, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were converted into 15.1 million shares of common stock. We used the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. On July 23, 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% six year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009, prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder, together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes on their scheduled maturity of December 15, 2009. We spent $950 million in fiscal 2010, $741 million in fiscal 2009 and $950 million in fiscal 2008 under our stock repurchase programs. We repurchased 27.0 million shares in fiscal 2010, 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 33.3 million shares in fiscal 2008. All shares repurchased were retired. We record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. During fiscal 2010, we completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in fiscal 2009 and initiated another multi year repurchase program that had been approved by the Board in September 2009. As of January 30, 2010, $795 million remained available for purchase under the program authorized in September 2009. In February 2010, the Board authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. We currently plan to repurchase up to approximately $900 million to $1 billion of our stock in fiscal 2011. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases and execution of Rule 10b5 1 plans from time to time based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, market conditions, the economic environment and prospects for the business and other factors, and the timing and amount of these purchases may change. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.48 per share in fiscal 2010, $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009 and $0.36 per share in fiscal 2008. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 33 Table of Contents $198 million in fiscal 2010, $177 million in fiscal 2009 and $151 million in fiscal 2008. We announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.15 per share, effective with the dividend payable in June 2010, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Financing activities also included proceeds of $170 million in fiscal 2010, $142 million in fiscal 2009 and $134 million in fiscal 2008 from the exercise of employee stock options. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. We have a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2010 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2011. TJX pays six basis points annually on the committed amounts under each of these credit facilities. These agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings. These agreements serve as backup to our commercial paper program. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 there were no outstanding short term borrowings. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $165 million during fiscal 2010 and $222 million during fiscal 2009. The weighted average interest rate on our U.S. short term borrowings was 1.01% in fiscal 2010. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, our foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million credit facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter of credit facility. There were no borrowings under the Canadian credit line for operating expenses in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. There were no amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit line for operating expenses at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, TJX Europe had a credit line of 20 million for our European operations. The maximum amount outstanding under this U.K. credit line was 1.9 million in fiscal 2010 and 6.1 million in fiscal 2009. There were no outstanding borrowings on this U.K. credit line at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating, debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note D to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and other financing sources. Contractual obligations: As of January 30, 2010, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 1,135,751 $ 42,863 $ 85,725 $ 85,725 $ 921,438 Operating lease commitments 5,695,061 1,005,366 1,771,055 1,307,773 1,610,867 Capital lease obligation 22,945 3,726 7,809 7,824 3,586 Purchase obligations 2,329,719 2,264,578 62,028 3,113 Total Obligations $ 9,183,476 $ 3,316,533 $ 1,926,617 $ 1,404,435 $ 2,535,891 The long term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We exclude from purchase obligations long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities which include $254.5 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $151.0 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which 34 Table of Contents are included in the lease commitments in the above table, and $181.7 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are continually reviewed and based on historical experience and other factors which we believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage. A significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. We believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods. In addition, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing the need for management estimates. Inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end. Thus, the difference between actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may cause fluctuations in quarterly results, but is not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions, which ultimately affect the value of inventory. We have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations. Impairment of long lived assets: We review the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We believe as of January 30, 2010 that the carrying value of our long lived assets is appropriate. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. The market performance on plan assets during fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return, and as a result the unfunded status of our qualified plan increased significantly at the end of fiscal 2009. Despite this, we were not required to fund our plan during fiscal 2009, primarily due to voluntary funding in prior years. In fiscal 2010 we funded our qualified pension plan with $132.7 million and may make additional voluntary contributions during fiscal 2011. Share based compensation: In accordance with U.S. GAAP, TJX estimates the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under its stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as share based compensation expense over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related expense. 35 Table of Contents Casualty insurance: In fiscal 2008, we initiated a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Previously, our casualty insurance program required us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. A large portion of these claims are funded with a non refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $17.1 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 30, 2010. Income taxes: Like many large corporations, our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However, it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions, will differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. It is possible that such final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which a examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations: As discussed in Note B and Note N to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Managements Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties. The Computer Intrusion reserve requires us to make estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims, litigation and investigations and costs and expenses we will incur. We make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims, litigation and investigations and of the amount of such costs and expenses. The leases relating to discontinued operations are long term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes arising out of the Computer Intrusion and the leases relating to discontinued operations and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and such differences could be material. We may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, where relevant, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessments inherently involve exercises of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, then we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is 36 Table of Contents probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian and European operations on the translation of these foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases by our operations of goods in currencies that are not their local currencies. As more fully described in Note E to our consolidated financial statements, we hedge a portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments. During fiscal 2009, we ceased hedging our net investment position in our foreign operations. We enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 30, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre tax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 by approximately $42 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents, short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of January 30, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are invested in equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. The significant decline in the financial markets over the last several years has impacted the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our plan, resulting in increased contributions to the plan.
