ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 52 week fiscal years ended January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2011) and January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), and the 53 week fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009). Like most retailers we have a 53 week fiscal year every five to six years. This extra week of sales volume, which also provides a lift to pre tax margins due to the flow of certain monthly and annual expenses, impacts comparisons to 52 week fiscal years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2011 include the following: Same store sales for fiscal 2011 increased 4% over the prior year. This was achieved on top of a 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010. Our strategies of operating with lean inventories and buying close to need, which we managed even more aggressively in fiscal 2010 and continued in fiscal 2011, increased inventory turns and drove continued growth in customer traffic resulting in healthy gains in sales and profitability in both years. Net sales increased 8% to $21.9 billion for fiscal 2011. Stores in operation and selling square footage were both up 4% at the end of fiscal 2011 compared to last fiscal year end. Foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by one percentage point. We made the major decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to consolidate the A.J. Wright business by converting 90 stores to other banners and closing the remaining 72 stores, its two distribution centers and home office. Although this transaction resulted in significant charges and operating losses to the A.J. Wright segment for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, we believe consolidating the A.J. Wright chain allows us to serve the A.J. Wright customer demographic more efficiently, focus our financial and managerial resources on fewer, larger businesses with higher returns and enhance our growth prospects overall. Our fiscal 2011 pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) was 9.9% compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2010. The fourth quarter results of the A.J. Wright segment decreased our fiscal 2011 pre tax margin by 0.7 percentage points, which was more than offset by strong merchandise margin growth as well as expense leverage. Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2011 improved 0.7 percentage points to 73.1%. Improved merchandise margins and leverage of buying and occupancy costs on strong same store sales more than offset the negative impact of 0.2 percentage points due to the fourth quarter results of the A.J. Wright segment. The selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2011 increased by 0.5 percentage points to 16.9%. The fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss negatively impacted the selling, general and administrative ratio by 0.6 percentage points, which was almost entirely offset by the benefit of cost reduction programs and expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2011. Income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, or $3.30 per diluted share, for fiscal 2011 compared to $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share includes the negative impact of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss of $0.21 per share and the benefit of $0.02 per share due to a reduction to the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 27.6 million shares of our common stock for $1.2 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. Consolidated average per store inventories from our continuing operations, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 4% at the end of fiscal 2011 versus the prior year end as compared to a decrease of 10% at the end of fiscal 2010 over the prior fiscal year end. In fiscal 2010 and 2011, we managed inventory levels more aggressively than in prior years, which had a much greater impact on the year over year inventory comparison in fiscal 2010 to the prior year. The fiscal 2011 per store inventories reflected larger available quantities of end of season branded product for future selling seasons based on greater market opportunities in fiscal 2011. The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. 21 Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 totaled $21.9 billion, an 8% increase over net sales of $20.3 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase reflected a 4% increase from same store sales, a 3% increase from new stores and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 totaled $20.3 billion, a 7% increase over net sales of $19.0 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase reflected a 6% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 2% decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a 1% decrease from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009. New stores have been a significant source of sales growth. Both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and by 3% in fiscal 2010 over the prior fiscal year. We expect to end fiscal 2012 with 2,913 stores, which would represent a 2% increase in both our consolidated store base and in our selling square footage. The anticipated growth rate for fiscal 2012 will be negatively impacted by the closing of the 72 A.J. Wright stores that will not be converted to other banners. The 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2011 was driven entirely by continued growth in transactions, with the value of the average transaction down slightly for the year. Junior apparel, jewelry and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2011. Geographically, same store sales increases in Canada were in line with the consolidated average while same store sales decreased in Europe. In the U.S., sales were strong throughout the country with the West Coast and Southwest above the consolidated average and the Northeast below the consolidated average. The 6% same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by significant increases in customer transactions at all of our businesses, partially offset by a decline in the value of the average transaction. The increase in customer transactions accelerated during the course of fiscal 2010. Junior apparel, dresses, childrens apparel, footwear, accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2010. Geographically, same store sales increases in Europe and Canada trailed the consolidated average. In the U.S., sales were strong throughout the country with the Midwest, Southeast and West Coast above the average, and New England and Florida below the average. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are in at least their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current years same store sales of our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of divisional operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year Ended January 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0% Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 73.1 73.8 75.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.9 16.4 16.5 Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion related costs (0.1 ) (0.2) Interest expense, net 0.2 0.2 0.1 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes* 9.9 % 9.6 % 7.6% * Due to rounding, the individual items may not foot to Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency affects our reported results are as follows: Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements we translate the operations of our segments in Canada and Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in 22 time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our Canadian and European segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period. Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our divisions, principally in Europe and Canada, purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies. As we have not elected hedge accounting as defined by U.S. GAAP, we record a mark to market gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark to market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark to market adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 73.1% in fiscal 2011, 73.8% in fiscal 2010 and 75.9% in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2011, the 0.2 percentage point negative impact of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss was more than offset by improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 0.5 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the 4% same store sales increase. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, leading to lower markdowns compared to the prior year. The improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 2.1 percentage points, along with expense leverage on the 6% same store sales increase, particularly in occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which resulted in an increase in markon, along with a reduction in markdowns compared to the prior year. These improvements were partially offset by a benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the 53rd week (approximately 0.2 percentage points). Additionally, for fiscal 2010, buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance that was well ahead of our objectives. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.9% in fiscal 2011, 16.4% in fiscal 2010 and 16.5% in fiscal 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the 0.6 percentage point negative effect of the fourth quarter A.J. Wright segment loss. Fiscal 2011 selling, general and administrative expenses include impairment charges, severance and termination benefits, lease related obligations and other store closing costs in connection with the A.J. Wright consolidation, which was almost entirely offset by the benefit of cost reduction programs, a reduction in our fiscal 2011 incentive compensation versus the prior year and expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2011. The improvement in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to levering of expenses and savings from our expense reduction initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by the increase in performance based incentive compensation, which increased selling, general and administrative expense ratio by 0.5 percentage points in fiscal 2010. Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs: In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP with respect to the Computer Intrusion. We reduced the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs by $11.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, primarily as a result of insurance proceeds and adjustments to our remaining reserve. The reserve balance was $17.3 million at January 29, 2011. As an estimate, the reserve is subject to uncertainty, actual costs may vary from the current estimate, however such variations are not expected to be material to our results. 23 Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net amounted to $39.1 million for fiscal 2011, $39.5 million for fiscal 2010 and $14.3 million for fiscal 2009. The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in thousands 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 49,014 $ 49,278 $ 38,123 Capitalized interest (758 ) (1,647 ) Interest (income) (9,877 ) (9,011 ) (22,185 ) Interest expense, net $ 39,137 $ 39,509 $ 14,291 Gross interest expense and gross interest income for fiscal 2011 were flat to the prior period. Gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal 2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% notes issued in April 2009 and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes issued in July 2009. The 6.95% notes were issued in conjunction with the call for redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities, and we refinanced our C$235 million credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the 4.20% notes. In addition, interest income for fiscal 2010 was less than fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of return on investments more than offsetting higher cash balances available for investment during fiscal 2010. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.1% in fiscal 2011, 37.8% in fiscal 2010 and 36.9% in fiscal 2009. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to the effects of repatriation of cash from Europe and increasing state tax reserves, partially offset by the finalization of an advance pricing agreement between Canada and the United States (related to our intercompany transfer pricing) and a favorable Canadian court ruling regarding withholding taxes. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable impact in fiscal 2009 of a $19 million reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement of several state tax audits. The absence of this fiscal 2009 benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 by 1.3 percentage points, partially offset by a reduction in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income. We anticipate an effective annual income tax rate for fiscal 2012 comparable to that for fiscal 2011. Income from continuing operations and income per share from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011, a 10% increase over the $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010, which in turn was a 33% increase over the $914.9 million in fiscal 2009. Comparisons between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are negatively impacted by $86 million for the after tax impact of the A.J. Wright fourth quarter segment loss. Income from continuing operations per share was $3.30 in fiscal 2011, $2.84 in fiscal 2010 and $2.08 in fiscal 2009. Several items, discussed below, affected earnings per share comparisons for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2011 earnings per share were adversely affected by the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter segment loss for A.J. Wright, which reduced earnings per share by $0.21 per share, offset in part by a $0.02 per share benefit for the fiscal 2011 reduction in the Provision for the Computer Intrusion related costs. Fiscal 2009 earnings per share reflected an estimated $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2009, as well as a $0.04 per share benefit from the fiscal 2009 reduction in the Provision for Computer Intrusion related costs. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2011 earnings per share by $0.02 per share compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. When comparing fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009, foreign currency rates reduced earnings per share by $0.01 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a $0.01 per share benefit in fiscal 2009. In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share, which are benefited by our share repurchase programs. We repurchased 27.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011; 27.0 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2010; and 24.0 million shares at a cost of $741 million in fiscal 2009. 24 Discontinued operations and net income: The fiscal 2011 net gain from discontinued operations reflects an after tax benefit of $3.6 million, (which did not impact earnings per share) as a result of a $6 million pre tax reduction for the estimated cost of settling lease related obligations of former businesses. Fiscal 2009 net loss from discontinued operations reflects an after tax loss of $34 million, or $0.08 per share, on the sale of Bobs Stores. Including the impact of discontinued operations, net income was $1.3 billion, or $3.30 per share, for fiscal 2011, $1.2 billion, or $2.84 per share, for fiscal 2010 and $880.6 million, or $2.00 per share, for fiscal 2009. Segment information: The following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments. As of January 29, 2011, we operated five business segments: three in the United States and one in each of Canada and Europe. In the United States, our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores are aggregated as the Marmaxx segment, and HomeGoods and A.J. Wright are each reported as a separate segment. A.J. Wright will cease to be a business segment during fiscal 2012 as a result of its consolidation. TJXs stores operated in Canada (Winners, HomeSense and StyleSense) are reported as the TJX Canada segment, and TJXs stores operated in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are reported as the TJX Europe segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expenses, Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion related costs, and interest expense. Segment profit or loss, as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. In addition, this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 14,092.2 $ 13,270.9 $ 12,362.1 Segment profit $ 1,876.0 $ 1,588.5 $ 1,155.8 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.3 % 12.0 % 9.3 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 7 % 0 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J. Maxx 923 890 874 Marshalls 830 813 806 Total Marmaxx 1,753 1,703 1,680 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.J. Maxx 21,611 20,890 20,543 Marshalls 20,912 20,513 20,388 Total Marmaxx 42,523 41,403 40,931 Net sales at Marmaxx increased 6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 4%, which was on top of a strong 7% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2011 was driven by continued growth in customer transactions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the value of the average transaction. The growth in customer transactions in fiscal 2011 was on top of a significant increase in fiscal 2010. Same store sales for womens apparel were above the chain average, with junior apparel particularly strong. Same store sales for mens apparel were slightly below the chain average. Home categories improved significantly at Marmaxx, with same store sales increases above the chain average for fiscal 2011. Geographically, there were strong trends throughout the country. Same store sales were strongest in the West Coast and Southwest, while the Northeast trailed the chain average for fiscal 2011. We also saw a lift in the net sales of stores renovated during the year. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales (segment margin or segment profit margin) increased to 13.3% in fiscal 2011 from 12.0% in fiscal 2010. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 0.8 percentage points driven primarily by lower markdowns. In addition, the 4% increase in same 25 store sales provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs which improved by 0.2 percentage points. Segment margin increased to 12.0% in fiscal 2010 from 9.3% in fiscal 2009. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 2.4 percentage points driven by lower markdowns and higher markon. In addition, the 7% increase in same store sales provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of sales, primarily due to higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. We expect to open approximately 116 new stores (net of closings and including the conversion of 65 A.J. Wright stores) in fiscal 2012, increasing the Marmaxx store base and selling square footage each by 7%. HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 1,958.0 $ 1,794.4 $ 1,578.3 Segment profit $ 186.5 $ 137.5 $ 42.4 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 9.5 % 7.7 % 2.7 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 6 % 9 % (3) % Stores in operation at end of period 336 323 318 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 6,619 6,354 6,248 HomeGoods net sales increased 9% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Same store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2011, driven by continued strong growth in customer traffic, compared to a same store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2010. Segment margin of 9.5% was up from 7.7% for fiscal 2010, due to increased merchandise margins, driven by decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 6% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by our continuing to manage this business with much lower inventory levels and increasing inventory turns. HomeGoods net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 9% in fiscal 2010, driven by significantly increased customer traffic, compared to a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2009. Segment margin of 7.7% was up significantly from 2.7% for fiscal 2009, due to increased merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 9% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory levels, which drove better off price buying and increased inventory turns. These improvements were partially offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. In fiscal 2012, we plan to add a net of 38 HomeGoods stores (including the conversion of 16 A.J. Wright stores) and increase selling square footage by 11%. A.J. Wright In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, TJX announced that it would consolidate its A.J. Wright division by converting 90 of the A.J. Wright stores into T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods stores and by closing the remaining 72 stores, its two distribution centers and home office. TJX commenced the liquidation process in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and 20 stores had been closed as of January 29, 2011. All of the remaining stores ceased operation by February 13, 2011. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 888.4 $ 779.8 $ 677.6 Segment profit (loss) $ (130.0) $ 12.6 $ 2.9 Segment profit (loss) as a percentage of net sales (14.6) % 1.6 % 0.4 % Percent increase in same store sales 6 % 9 % 4 % Stores in operation at end of period 142 150 135 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,874 3,012 2,680 26 A majority of the costs related to the closing of the A.J. Wright business were recorded in the fourth quarter. The operating results of the A.J. Wright segment for the full year of fiscal 2011 include a fourth quarter loss of $140.6 million, which includes the following: Fiscal 2011 Dollars in thousands Fourth Quarter Fixed asset impairment charges Non cash $ 82,589 Severance and termination benefits 25,400 Lease obligations and other closing costs 11,700 Operating losses 20,912 Total segment loss $ 140,601 In the first half of fiscal 2012, TJX will incur additional store closing costs and operating losses due to the completion of the A.J. Wright store closings as well as the costs to convert the A.J. Wright stores to other TJX banners and grand re opening costs for those stores. TJX estimates that during fiscal 2012, it will incur additional A.J. Wright segment losses of approximately $66 million, primarily relating to the completion of store operations and lease related obligations, and conversion costs and grand re opening costs of approximately $28 million, which will be reflected in the segments of the new banners into which the stores are converted. The majority of these charges are expected to be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. A.J. Wrights net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, and same store sales increased 9%. Segment profit increased to $12.6 million in fiscal 2010, compared to segment profit of $2.9 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved merchandise margin. Like our other divisions, cost reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense leverage on the same store sales increase was partially offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation. International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 2,510.2 $ 2,167.9 $ 2,139.4 Segment profit $ 352.0 $ 255.0 $ 236.1 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.0 % 11.8 % 11.0 % Percent increase in same store sales 4 % 2 % 3 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 215 211 202 HomeSense 82 79 75 Total 297 290 277 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 4,966 4,847 4,647 HomeSense 1,594 1,527 1,437 Total 6,560 6,374 6,084 Net sales for TJX Canada (which includes Winners and HomeSense) increased 16% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by approximately 9 percentage points, as compared to the same period last year. Same store sales were up 4% in fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2% in fiscal 2010. Same store sales of mens apparel, dresses and home fashions were above the segment average for fiscal 2011. Segment profit for fiscal 2011 increased to $352 million compared to $255 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation increased segment profit by $25 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The mark to market adjustment on inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2011 by $7 million compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. The unfavorable change in the mark to market adjustment of our inventory hedges reduced fiscal 2011 segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. TJX Canada segment margin increased 2.2 percentage 27 points to 14.0% in fiscal 2011, compared to 11.8% in fiscal 2010. The segment margin improvement in fiscal 2011 was driven by a strong improvement in merchandise margins. Net sales increased 1% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $62 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 3% in fiscal 2009. Same store sales of junior apparel, dresses, mens apparel and footwear, as well as HomeSense on a standalone basis, were above the segment average for fiscal 2010. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to $255 million compared to $236 million in fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by $4 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The mark to market adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Segment margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 11.8% in fiscal 2010, compared to 11.0% in fiscal 2009, which was primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins. Improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives. As of the end of fiscal 2011, we operated three StyleSense stores which are included in the Winners totals in the above table. We are bringing the Marshalls chain to Canada, with six stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2012. We believe that Canada can ultimately support 90 to 100 Marshalls stores. We expect to add a net of 15 stores in Canada in fiscal 2012 (including the Marshalls stores) and plan to increase selling square footage by 5%.

Currency translation negatively impacted the fiscal 2011 results, reducing net sales by $86 million. Same store sales were down 3% in fiscal 2011 compared to a 5% increase in fiscal 2010. Segment profit decreased to $75.8 million for fiscal 2011, and segment profit margin decreased to 3.0%. We believe that execution issues at TJX Europe were the primary reasons for below plan sales and segment profit. We believe that our expansion in Europe took managements focus off of the proper execution of the fundamentals of our off price strategy and that as a result, consumers did not find the values they had come to expect at our stores. This led to same store sales declines, reduced merchandise margins, as a result of increased markdowns, and the de levering of expenses. We intend to slow store growth for TJX Europe in fiscal 2012 and focus on correcting the execution issues. Despite this setback, we remain confident that Europe holds significant growth potential for TJX. Net sales for TJX Europe increased in fiscal 2010 to $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009. Currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately $252 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2009. Same store sales increased 5% for fiscal 2010 compared to a 4% increase in fiscal 2009. Segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $164 million, and segment profit margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 7.2%. The increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise margins and leverage of expenses on the 5% same store sales increase, partially offset by costs of operations in Germany and Poland along with higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation in fiscal 2010. We also invested in strengthening our shared services infrastructure. 28 Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment profit, while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a favorable mark to market adjustment of $10 million, primarily relating to the conversion of Euros to Pound Sterling. As stated above, we intend to slow our growth in fiscal 2012. We plan to open a net of 27 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe and to expand total TJX Europe selling square footage by 8%. This compares to a net increase of 54 stores and an 18% increase in selling square footage in fiscal 2011. General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 General corporate expense $ 168.7 $ 166.4 $ 140.0 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, except for the mark to market adjustment on diesel fuel hedges, which is included in cost of sales. Fiscal 2011 general corporate expense was relatively flat to the prior year. The slight increase in fiscal 2011 was due to increased investment in corporate systems, management training programs and normal expense growth offsetting the effect of higher charitable donations and incentive compensation incurred in fiscal 2010. The increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an $18 million contribution to the TJX Foundation in fiscal 2010 and higher performance based incentive and benefit plan accruals, partially offset by benefits related to hedging activity. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,976 million in fiscal 2011, $2,272 million in fiscal 2010 and $1,155 million in fiscal 2009. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 decreased $295 million compared to fiscal 2010. Net income plus the non cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $1,897 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,659 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $238 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $48 million in fiscal 2011, compared to a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010. Although we continued to operate with leaner inventories throughout fiscal 2011, our strategy of being more aggressive with managing inventories had a much greater impact on cash flows in fiscal 2010. In addition, the increase in inventory in fiscal 2011 reflected our business growth, as well as a year end increase in packaway merchandise to take advantage of market opportunities. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable unfavorably impacted fiscal 2011 cash flows, as compared to fiscal 2010, by $203 million due to the timing of tax payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $78 million in fiscal 2011 compared to cash provided of $31 million in fiscal 2010. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased $1,117 million compared to fiscal 2009. Net income provided cash of $1,214 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $333 million over net income of $881 million in fiscal 2009. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, provided a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009. The reduction in inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, which, in turn, increased inventory turnover. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by $191 million compared to a decrease in cash of $49 million in fiscal 2009. The change in prepaid expenses and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010 cash flows of $64 million, primarily due to the timing of February rental payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal 2010, compared to a $35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009, reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performance based incentive compensation, partially offset by increased funding of the pension plan. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the deferred income tax provision, which reduced cash flows by $79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable impact of $61 million of all other items, which primarily reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009. Reserve for obligations of former operations: We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of businesses we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bobs Stores and A.J. Wright. The 29 majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these businesses. The reserve balance was $54.7 million at January 29, 2011 and $35.9 million at January 30, 2010. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. We may also be contingently liable on up to 13 leases of BJs Wholesale Club, a former TJX business, and up to seven leases of Bobs Stores, in addition to those included in the reserve. The reserve for former operations does not reflect these leases because we do not believe that the likelihood of future liability to us is probable. Off balance sheet liabilities: We have contingent obligations on leases, for which we were a lessee or guarantor, which were assigned to third parties without TJX being released by the landlords. Over many years, we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties. With the exception of leases of our former businesses for which we have reserved, we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases, and accordingly, we do not expect that such leases will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them that could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants do not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases. We also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate. We estimate the undiscounted obligations of (i) leases of former operations not included in our reserve for former operations and (ii) properties of our discontinued operations that we would expect to sublet, if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations, is approximately $75 million as of January 29, 2011. We believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and, to the extent they do, will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors. We are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold, specified environmental matters or certain income taxes. These obligations are typically limited in time and amount. There are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations. Investing Activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2011 2010 2009 New stores $ 196.3 $ 127.8 $ 147.6 Store renovations and improvements 301.0 206.8 264.3 Office and distribution centers 209.8 94.7 171.0 Capital expenditures $ 707.1 $ 429.3 $ 582.9 We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $800 million to $825 million for fiscal 2012, which we expect to fund through internally generated funds. Fiscal 2012 capital expenditures are expected to include $239 million for new stores, $55 million of which is associated with converting the 90 A.J. Wright stores to other banners. Additionally, $269 million is for our offices and distribution centers to support growth and $317 million is for store renovations. We also purchased short term investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented. In fiscal 2011, we purchased $120 million of such short term investments, compared to $279 million in fiscal 2010. Additionally, $180 million of such short term investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2011 compared to $153 million last year. No such short term investments were held during fiscal 2009. Investing activities for fiscal 2009 also include cash flows associated with net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter of that year. The net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to $14.4 million. 30 Financing Activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,224 million in fiscal 2011, $584 million in fiscal 2010 and $769 million in fiscal 2009. We spent $1,200 million to repurchase and retire 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2011, $950 million to repurchase and retire 27.0 million shares in fiscal 2010 and $741 million to repurchase and retire 24.0 million shares in fiscal 2009 under our stock repurchase programs. We record the purchase of our stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program approved in September 2009 and initiated another $1 billion stock repurchase program approved in February 2010. As of January 29, 2011, $594 million remained available for purchase under that program, and in February 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2012. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases made directly and under Rule 10b5 1 plans from time to time based on our assessment of various factors including anticipated excess cash flow, liquidity, market conditions, the economic environment and prospects for the business and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change from our plans. Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. On April 7, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% ten year notes. Related to this transaction, TJX called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were converted into 15.1 million shares of common stock. We used the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. On July 23, 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% six year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our C$235 million term credit facility on August 10, 2009, prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder, together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes on their scheduled maturity of December 15, 2009. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.60 per share in fiscal 2011, $0.48 per share in fiscal 2010 and $0.44 per share in fiscal 2009. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $229 million in fiscal 2011, $198 million in fiscal 2010 and $177 million in fiscal 2009. We announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.19 per share, effective with the dividend payable in June 2011, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Financing activities also included proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $176 million in fiscal 2011, $170 million in fiscal 2010 and $142 million in fiscal 2009. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. As of January 29, 2011, we had a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2013 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2011. The three year agreement maturing in May 2013 was entered into in May 2010 to replace a similar agreement that matured at that time. The three year agreement requires the payment of 17.5 basis points annually on the unused committed amount. The agreement maturing in May 2011 requires the payment of six basis points annually on the committed amount (whether used or unused). Both of these agreements have no compensating balance requirements; contain various covenants, including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings and serve as back up to TJXs commercial paper program. The availability under our revolving credit facilities was $1 billion at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, and we had no borrowings outstanding at those dates under these agreements. We believe existing cash balances, internally generated funds and our revolving credit facilities will meet our future operating needs. The maximum amount of our U.S. short term borrowings outstanding was $165 million during fiscal 2010. There were no U.S. short term borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2011. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, TJXs foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities. TJX Canada had two credit lines, a C$10 million facility for operating expenses and a C$10 million letter of credit facility. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding on the Canadian credit line for operating expenses. As of January 29, 2011, TJX Europe had a credit line of 20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings on this European credit line as of January 29, 2011 or January 30, 2010. We believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities will adequately meet our operating, debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. See Note K to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt and other financing sources. 31 Contractual obligations: As of January 29, 2011, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 1,092,963 $ 42,863 $ 85,725 $ 485,701 $ 478,674 Operating lease commitments 6,800,093 1,092,709 1,938,020 1,464,690 2,304,674 Capital lease obligation 19,219 3,897 7,824 7,498 Purchase obligations 2,673,988 2,635,019 34,976 3,993 Total Obligations $ 10,586,263 $ 3,774,488 $ 2,066,545 $ 1,961,882 $ 2,783,348 The long term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs. The lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise; purchase orders for capital expenditures, supplies and other operating needs; commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services; and commitments under executive employment and other agreements. We exclude from purchase obligations long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities which include $209.0 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $165.3 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table, and $179.8 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory, which results in a weighted average cost. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry, and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing managements discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Thus, actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results, but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions that ultimately affect the value of inventory. We have generally not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations. Impairment of long lived assets: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those 32 assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We believe as of January 29, 2011 that the carrying value of our long lived assets was appropriate. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. When the market performance of our plan assets, discount rates or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, we may make contributions to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2011 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $100 million. Share based compensation: In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as share based compensation over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. Casualty insurance: In fiscal 2008, we initiated a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance. Previously, our casualty insurance program required us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. The estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. A large portion of these claims is funded with a non refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. We had a net accrual of $14.2 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of January 29, 2011. Income taxes: Like many large corporations, our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. Such authorities may challenge positions we take, and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions will not be sustained upon examination. However, it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions, will differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. It is possible that such final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for Computer Intrusion related costs and for former operations: As discussed in Notes B and C to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Managements Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising out of the Computer Intrusion and for future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the Computer Intrusion and in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other former businesses are long term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the lease, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We 33 believe that our reserves are reasonable estimates of the most likely outcomes of the future obligations arising out of the Computer Intrusion and the future obligations of our former operations and should be adequate to cover the ultimate costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our Canadian and European operations on the translation of these foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold. As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated financial statements, we hedge a portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging an underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 29, 2011, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre tax income for fiscal 2011 by approximately $43 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents, short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that fixed interest rates on most of our debt minimizes our exposure to changes in market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to our maximum variable rate debt outstanding, and to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of January 29, 2011. The analysis indicated that such an adverse movement as of that date would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets can adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased contributions to the plan.
