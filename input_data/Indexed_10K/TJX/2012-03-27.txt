ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion that follows relates to our 52 week fiscal years ended January 28, 2012 (fiscal 2012), January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2011) and January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010). OVERVIEW The TJX Companies, Inc. is the largest off price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise through our four segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls); and TJX Europe (which operates T.K. Maxx and HomeSense). Fiscal 2012 was another record year for us. Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2012 include the following: In fiscal 2012, we posted strong gains in same store sales, net sales and earnings per share on top of significant increases in the last two fiscal years. Same store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2012 over increases of 4% and 6% in the previous two years. The fiscal 2012 increase reflected an increase in both the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic as we continued to grow our customer base. Net sales increased to $23.2 billion for fiscal 2012, up 6% over last years comparable period. Earnings per share for fiscal 2012 were $1.93 per diluted share, up 17% compared to $1.65 per diluted share in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the items under Adjusted Financial Measures below, were $1.99 in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.75 in fiscal 2011, up 14%. Foreign currency exchange rates benefited fiscal 2012 earnings by $0.01 per share compared to a $0.01 negative impact last year. Our U.S. businesses continued to exceed our expectations in fiscal 2012, posting strong same store sales increases on top of significant increases in the prior two years and increasing their segment profits. Both of our international businesses recovered momentum at the end of fiscal 2012. TJX Europe returned to a strong same store sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 after issues with the execution of our off price fundamentals, as well as growth which we believe was too aggressive and had led to performance issues that had begun in fiscal 2011. TJX Canada also posted a positive same store sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 following execution issues in womens and, to a lesser extent, childrens categories earlier in the year. In fiscal 2012, we continued to drive the growth of our chains. At January 28, 2012, both stores in operation and selling square footage were up 2% over the end of fiscal 2011 including the effect of store closures from our A.J. Wright consolidation. We increased our long term potential growth estimates in the U.S. for HomeGoods from 600 to 750 stores and believe we have widened the demographic reach of our customer base. We completed the consolidation of our A.J. Wright business, which has focused our financial and managerial resources on fewer, larger businesses with higher returns and enhanced the growth prospects of the overall company. We introduced the Marshalls chain to Canada, which we believe can ultimately grow to be a 90 to 100 store chain in Canada. We ended fiscal 2012 with six Canadian Marshalls stores and closed our three StyleSense stores to focus our shoe business on the much larger and more profitable shoe categories at Winners and Marshalls. We slowed growth at TJX Europe in fiscal 2012 to permit the business to focus on improving its operating results and saw improvements by the end of the fiscal year. We continue to believe in the 23 significant growth opportunities for our business in Europe, estimating a total of 750 to 875 stores long term, with just our current banners in the countries in which we currently operate. We continued to work to strengthen the execution of our business model of buying opportunistically and close to need, operating with lean inventories and rapid merchandise turns and controlling expenses. Our fiscal 2012 pre tax margin (the ratio of pre tax income to net sales) was 10.4%, a 0.5 percentage point increase from 9.9% in fiscal 2011, while our adjusted pre tax margin was 10.7%, a 0.1 percentage point increase from an adjusted 10.6% for fiscal 2011. See Adjusted Financial Measures below for definition of adjustments. Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2012 compared to the same period last year improved 0.4 percentage points to 72.7% and improved 0.3 percentage points from 72.9% to 72.6% on an adjusted basis. The improvements over last year were primarily due to buying and occupancy expense leverage. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2012 decreased 0.1 percentage points to 16.8% and, on an adjusted basis, increased 0.2 percentage points from 16.3% to 16.5%. Our consolidated average per store inventories for our existing businesses, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers, were up 3% at the end of fiscal 2012. We continue to use cash to return value to our shareholders. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased 49.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.4 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. On January 31, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized our 13th stock repurchase program for an additional $2 billion. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we announced our expectation to repurchase approximately $1.2 to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2013. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.095 per share, aggregating $275 million, for fiscal 2012. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2013 of $0.115 per share, or an annual dividend of $0.46, up 21% over the prior year, subject to the declaration and approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split of our common stock, reflecting our strong performance and confidence in our future. (All share and related data have been adjusted to reflect the split.) The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 totaled $23.2 billion, a 6% increase over $21.9 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase reflected a 5% increase from new stores, a 4% increase from same store sales and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates, offset in part by a 4% decrease due to the elimination of sales from stores operating under the A.J. Wright banner. (The fiscal 2012 sales from the converted A.J. Wright stores are included in new stores.) Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 totaled $21.9 billion, an 8% increase over $20.3 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase reflected a 4% increase from same store sales, a 3% increase from new stores and a 1% increase from foreign currency exchange rates. Our consolidated store count and selling square footage as of January 28, 2012 each increased 2% as compared to the same period last year. These levels of increase, lower than our historical levels, were primarily due to the 72 A.J. Wright stores that were closed and not converted to other banners. We expect to end fiscal 2013 with 3,055 stores, which would represent a 5% increase in both our consolidated store base and our selling square footage. Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2012 reflected an increase in both the value of the average transaction and the number of transactions, which in turn reflected an increase in customer traffic. Same store sales of our home, dresses, mens, shoes and accessories categories were particularly strong. Geographically, same store sales increases in the U.S. were strong throughout most regions with Florida and the Southwest performing above the consolidated average and the Midwest trailing the consolidated average. Although for the 24 full fiscal year 2012, the same store sales increase for TJX Europe was well below the consolidated average, and same store sales at TJX Canada decreased from the prior year, both Europe and Canada posted strong same store sales gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The 4% same store sales increase in fiscal 2011 was driven entirely by growth in the number of transactions, with the value of the average transaction down slightly for the year. Juniors, jewelry and home performed particularly well in fiscal 2011. Geographically, in the U.S., same store sales were strong throughout the country with the West Coast and Southwest above the consolidated average and the Northeast below the consolidated average. The same store sales increase in Canada was in line with the consolidated average, while same store sales decreased in Europe. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current years same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales on an as reported and as adjusted basis: Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2012 Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2011 Percentage of Net SalesFiscal Year 2010*** As reported As adjusted* As reported As adjusted* As reported As adjusted* Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % n/a Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 72.7 72.6 73.1 72.9 73.8 n/a Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 16.5 16.9 16.3 16.4 n/a Provision (credit) for Computer Intrusion related expenses (0.1 ) n/a Interest expense, net 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 n/a Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes** 10.4 % 10.7 % 9.9 % 10.6 % 9.6 % n/a Diluted earnings per share continuing operations $ 1.93 $ 1.99 $ 1.65 $ 1.75 $ 1.42 n/a * See Adjusted Financial Measures below. ** Figures may not foot due to rounding. *** There were no adjustments for fiscal 2010. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency affects our reported results are as follows: Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX Europe from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period. 25 Inventory hedges: We routinely enter into inventory related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our divisions, principally in Europe and Canada, purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies. As we have not elected hedge accounting for these instruments as defined by GAAP, we record a mark to market gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark to market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark to market adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report. Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 72.7% in fiscal 2012, 73.1% in fiscal 2011 and 73.8% in fiscal 2010. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2012 was due to expense leverage on buying and occupancy costs (particularly at Marmaxx and HomeGoods) partially offset by lower merchandise margins at TJX Europe and TJX Canada. The improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2011 reflected improved consolidated merchandise margin, which increased 0.5 percentage points over the prior year, along with expense leverage on the 4% same store sales increase, partially offset by a 0.2 percentage point negative impact from the A.J. Wright segment loss in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter arising from the A.J. Wright consolidation. Merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need, leading to lower markdowns compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.8% in fiscal 2012, 16.9% in fiscal 2011 and 16.4% in fiscal 2010. The A.J. Wright consolidation had a significant impact on this ratio in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, increasing the ratio by 0.3 percentage points in fiscal 2012 and 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 0.2 percentage points in fiscal 2012 and decreased 0.1 percentage points in fiscal 2011. The increase in the adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was due to increased general corporate expenses, primarily investment in new systems, talent and e commerce, costs associated with a voluntary retirement program and fourth quarter charges and write offs at TJX Canada and TJX Europe (see segment discussions below), offset in part by expense leverage on strong same store sales, particularly at HomeGoods. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 as a percentage of net sales, on an adjusted basis, compared to fiscal 2010 reflected the benefit of cost reduction programs, a reduction in incentive compensation versus the prior year and expense leverage on strong same store sales. Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net was an expense of $35.6 million for fiscal 2012, $39.1 million for fiscal 2011 and $39.5 million for fiscal 2010. The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in thousands 2012 2011 2010 Interest expense $ 49,276 $ 49,014 $ 49,278 Capitalized interest (2,593 ) (758 ) Interest (income) (11,035 ) (9,877 ) (9,011 ) Interest expense, net $ 35,648 $ 39,137 $ 39,509 Gross interest expense for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was essentially flat to the respective prior periods. Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.0% in fiscal 2012, 38.1% in fiscal 2011 and 37.8% in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to a reduction in tax reserves related to the resolution of U.S. Federal tax audits, partially offset by an increase in state and federal tax reserves, for a net decrease in the provision. 26 The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to the effects of repatriation of cash from Europe and an increase in our state tax reserves, partially offset by the finalization of an advance pricing agreement between Canada and the United States (related to our intercompany transfer pricing) and a favorable Canadian court ruling regarding withholding taxes. We anticipate our effective annual income tax rate for fiscal 2013 will increase to 38.5% primarily due to the expiration of the U.S. Work Opportunity Tax Credit legislation and the absence of the fiscal 2012 net benefit due to a reduction in our tax reserves. Income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations: Income from continuing operations was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2012, a 12% increase over $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011, which in turn was a 10% increase over $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.93. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 were $1.99, which exclude the negative impact of $0.04 of costs related to closing the A.J. Wright stores not closed in fiscal 2011 and $0.02 of costs to convert and re open A.J. Wright stores under other banners. Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.65. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 were $1.75, which exclude the negative effect of the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter segment loss for A.J. Wright arising from closing A.J. Wright, which reduced earnings per share by $0.11, offset in part by a $0.01 per share benefit for a reduction in the provision for the Computer Intrusion related costs. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. When comparing fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2011, foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2012 earnings per share by $0.01 per share compared with a $0.01 per share negative impact in fiscal 2011. When comparing fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010, foreign currency exchange rates benefited fiscal 2011 earnings per share by $0.02 per share compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. In addition, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share. Our stock repurchases benefit our earnings per share. We repurchased 49.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012, 55.1 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011, and 54.0 million shares at a cost of $950 million in fiscal 2010. Discontinued operations and net income: In fiscal 2011, we had a net gain from discontinued operations reflecting an after tax benefit of $3.6 million (which did not impact diluted earnings per share) as a result of a $6 million pre tax reduction of the estimated cost of settling lease related obligations of former businesses. Net income, which includes the impact of these discontinued operations, was $1.5 billion, or $1.93 per share, for fiscal 2012, $1.3 billion, or $1.65 per share, for fiscal 2011, and $1.2 billion, or $1.42 per share, for fiscal 2010. Adjusted Financial Measures: In addition to presenting financial results in conformity with GAAP, we are also presenting them on an adjusted basis. We adjusted them to exclude: from the fiscal 2012 results, the costs related to the A.J. Wright consolidation, including closing costs and additional operating losses related to the A.J. Wright stores closed in fiscal 2012 and the costs incurred by the Marmaxx and HomeGoods segments to convert former A.J. Wright stores to their banners and hold grand re opening events for these stores, and from the fiscal 2011 results, the operating loss of the A.J. Wright segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which included a majority of the costs related to closing the A.J. Wright business, and the benefit of a reduction to the provision for the Computer Intrusion which occurred over four years ago. These adjusted financial results are non GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results provides additional information on comparisons between periods including underlying trends of our business by excluding these items that affect overall comparability. We use these adjusted measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance, and our Board of Directors use them in assessing our business and making compensation decisions. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 27 Reconciliations of each of the adjusted financial measures to the financial measures in accordance with GAAP are provided below.

Maxx and Marshalls stores) and HomeGoods. Our TJX Canada segment operates our stores in Canada (Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls), and our TJX Europe segment operates our stores in Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense). A. J. Wright ceased to be a segment following its consolidation. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which we define as pre tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense. Segment profit or loss, as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms segment margin or segment profit margin are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments: U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 15,367.5 $ 14,092.2 $ 13,270.9 Segment profit $ 2,073.4 $ 1,876.0 $ 1,588.5 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.5 % 13.3 % 12.0 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* 13.6 % n/a n/a Percent increase in same store sales 5 % 4 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J.

Net sales at Marmaxx increased 9% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Same store sales for Marmaxx were up 5%, on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2012 was driven by a balanced increase in the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic. Customer transactions grew in fiscal 2012 on top of a significant increase in fiscal 2011. The categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases in fiscal 2012 were dresses, mens, shoes and accessories. Geographically, there were strong same store sales increases throughout the country, with Florida and the Southwest the strongest and the Midwest below the chain average. Segment margin was up 0.2 percentage points to 13.5% for fiscal 2012 compared to 13.3% for fiscal 2011, primarily due to expense leverage (particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.3 percentage points) on strong same store sales growth. This improvement was offset in part by slightly lower merchandise margins and the store conversion and grand re opening costs of former A.J. Wright stores converted to T.J. Maxx or Marshalls. Adjusted segment profit margin, which excludes the A.J. Wright conversion costs, increased 0.3 percentage points to 13.6% for fiscal 2012. Segment margin increased to 13.3% in fiscal 2011 from 12.0% in fiscal 2010. This increase in segment margin for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins of 0.8 percentage points, largely as a result of lower markdowns. In addition, the 4% increase in same store sales for this period provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales, particularly occupancy costs, which improved by 0.2 percentage points. In fiscal 2013, we expect to open approximately 85 new Marmaxx stores (net of closings) and increase selling square footage by 4%. 29 HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 2,244.0 $ 1,958.0 $ 1,794.4 Segment profit $ 234.4 $ 186.5 $ 137.5 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 10.4 % 9.5 % 7.7 % Adjusted segment profit as a percentage of net sales* 10.6 % n/a n/a Percent increase in same store sales 6 % 6 % 9 % Stores in operation at end of period 374 336 323 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 7,391 6,619 6,354 * See reconciliation under Adjusted Financial Measures. HomeGoods net sales increased 15% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Same store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2012, on top of a strong same store sales increase of 6% in fiscal 2011 resulting from a strong increase in customer traffic along with an increase in the value of the average transaction. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 was 10.4% up from 9.5% for fiscal 2011. The increase was due to expense leverage on the 6% same store sales increase and an increase in merchandise margins (primarily due to lower markdowns), partially offset by the conversion and grand re opening costs of former A.J. Wright stores converted to HomeGoods. Adjusted segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 excluding the A.J. Wright conversion costs increased 1.1 percentage points to 10.6%. HomeGoods net sales increased 9% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Same store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2011, driven by continued strong growth in customer traffic, compared to a same store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2010. Segment margin of 9.5% was up from 7.7% for fiscal 2010, due to increased merchandise margins, driven by decreased markdowns, levering of expenses on the 6% same store sales and operational efficiencies. The merchandise margin improvements were driven by efforts to manage this business with much lower inventory levels than in previous years and by increasing our inventory turns. In fiscal 2013, we plan a net increase of approximately 40 HomeGoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by 11%. A.J. Wright We completed the consolidation of the A.J. Wright division in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, closing the remaining stores not being converted to other banners. These closing costs (primarily lease related obligations) and A.J. Wright operating losses incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were reported as an A.J. Wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Due to the anticipated migration of customers to other chains, A.J. Wright was not treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 9.2 $ 888.4 $ 779.8 Segment profit (loss) $ (49.3 ) $ (130.0 ) $ 12.6 Percent increase in same store sales 6 % 9 % Stores in operation at end of period 142 150 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 2,874 3,012 30 A majority of the costs related to the closing of the A.J. Wright business were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The operating results of the A.J. Wright segment for the full year of fiscal 2011 include a fourth quarter loss of $140.6 million, which includes the following: Dollars in thousands Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter Fixed asset impairment charges Non cash $ 82,589 Severance and termination benefits 25,400 Lease obligations and other closing costs 11,700 Operating losses 20,912 Total segment loss $ 140,601 International Segments: TJX Canada Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 2,680.1 $ 2,510.2 $ 2,167.9 Segment profit $ 348.0 $ 352.0 $ 255.0 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.0 % 14.0 % 11.8 % Percent (decrease) increase in same store sales (1 )% 4 % 2 % Stores in operation at end of period Winners 216 215 211 HomeSense 86 82 79 Marshalls 6 Total 308 297 290 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) Winners 5,008 4,966 4,847 HomeSense 1,670 1,594 1,527 Marshalls 162 Total 6,840 6,560 6,374 Net sales for TJX Canada increased 7% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2012 sales growth by approximately 4 percentage points, as compared to the same period last year. Same store sales decreased 1% in fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 4% in fiscal 2011 largely due to execution issues in womens and, to a lesser extent, childrens categories. Our efforts to address these issues showed improved results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 with same store sales growth of 3%. Segment profit for fiscal 2012 decreased to $348.0 million, due to weak sales volume in the first three quarters (mitigated in part by strong inventory and expense management) and, to a lesser extent, a fourth quarter charge of $6 million for the closure of our StyleSense stores. These decreases in segment profit more than offset a $10 million benefit from foreign currency translation and a $4 million benefit from mark to market adjustment on inventory related hedges. The decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to expense deleverage and lower merchandise margins, which more than offset the favorable change in the mark to market adjustment of our inventory related hedges. Net sales for TJX Canada increased 16% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Currency translation benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by approximately 9 percentage points, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Same store sales were up 4% in fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2% in fiscal 2010. Same store sales of mens apparel, dresses and home fashions were above the segment average for fiscal 2011. Segment profit for fiscal 2011 increased to $352 million, compared to $255 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation increased segment profit by $25 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The mark to market adjustment on inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2011 by $7 million compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010. Segment margin increased 2.2 percentage points to 14.0% in 31 fiscal 2011, compared to 11.8% in fiscal 2010. The segment margin improvement in fiscal 2011 was driven by a strong improvement in merchandise margins, offset by the unfavorable change in the mark to market adjustment of our inventory hedges, which reduced fiscal 2011 segment margin by 0.3 percentage points. We opened our first six Marshalls stores in Canada in fiscal 2012. We expect to add a net of 15 stores in Canada in fiscal 2013 and plan to increase selling square footage by 5%. TJX Europe Fiscal Year Ended January U.S. Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 Net sales $ 2,890.7 $ 2,493.5 $ 2,275.4 Segment profit $ 68.7 $ 75.8 $ 164.0 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 2.4 % 3.0 % 7.2 % Percent increase (decrease) in same store sales 2 % (3 )% 5 % Stores in operation at end of period T.K.

Currency translation benefited fiscal 2012 sales growth by 4 percentage points. Same store sales were up 2% in fiscal 2012 compared to a decrease of 3% in fiscal 2011. TJX Europe ended fiscal 2012 by posting a fourth quarter same store sales increase of 10%. We believe the improvement at the end of fiscal 2012 reflected the benefits of our strategy of slowing growth in Europe and re focusing on execution of our off price fundamentals. Segment profit decreased to $68.7 million for fiscal 2012, and segment profit margin decreased to 2.4%. For fiscal 2012, the impact of foreign currency translation and the mark to market adjustment on inventory related hedges was immaterial. Our fiscal 2012 results reflect aggressive markdowns, primarily taken in the first quarter to clear inventory and adjust our merchandise mix. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 TJX Europe incurred charges for the closing of an office facility and the write off of certain technology systems and other adjustments, which contributed to the decrease in segment profit and segment margin. Despite these fourth quarter charges, segment profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 nearly doubled reflecting the effects of the changes we made to address the execution issues that adversely affected fiscal 2011 and earlier parts of fiscal 2012. Net sales for TJX Europe increased in fiscal 2011 to $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2010. Currency translation negatively impacted the fiscal 2011 results, reducing net sales by $86 million. Same store sales were down 3% in fiscal 2011 compared to a 5% increase in fiscal 2010. Segment profit decreased to $75.8 million for fiscal 2011, and segment profit margin decreased to 3.0%. Issues with the execution of our off price fundamentals as well as growth, which we believe was too aggressive, led to TJX Europes below plan sales and segment profit in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2013, we plan to keep our growth rate modest with a net of 10 new T.K. Maxx stores in Europe, expanding selling square footage by 2%. Longer term, we continue to believe that TJX Europe holds significant growth potential for our Company. 32 General Corporate Expense: Fiscal Year Ended January Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 General corporate expense $ 228.3 $ 168.7 $ 166.4 General corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to our investments in systems and technology, talent and associate training expenses, costs related to our e commerce initiative and costs related to a fourth quarter voluntary retirement program and an executive separation agreement. Collectively, these items accounted for approximately $40 million of the increase in general corporate expenses for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 general corporate expense was relatively flat to the prior year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,916 million in fiscal 2012, $1,976 million in fiscal 2011 and $2,272 million in fiscal 2010. The cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2012 decreased $60 million compared to fiscal 2011. Net income plus the non cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $1,995 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $1,897 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $98 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $224 million in fiscal 2012, compared to $48 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in inventory was in our distribution centers, primarily due to higher pack away inventory as we continued to take advantage of market opportunities. The average inventory in our stores at the end of fiscal 2012 was below fiscal 2011 levels. The additional cash outlay for the net change in inventory and accounts payable is due to the timing of payments. The impact of the changes in all other assets and liabilities, which reduced operating cash flows by $77 million year over year, was more than offset by the favorable impact on cash flows of $94 million due to a higher deferred income tax provision. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 decreased $295 million compared to fiscal 2010. Net income plus the non cash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of $1,897 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,659 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $238 million. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $48 million in fiscal 2011, compared to a source of cash of $345 million in fiscal 2010. Although we continued to operate with leaner inventories throughout fiscal 2011, our strategy of being more aggressive with managing inventories had a much greater impact on cash flows in fiscal 2010. In addition, the increase in inventory in fiscal 2011 reflected our business growth, as well as a year end increase in packaway merchandise to take advantage of market opportunities. Changes in current income taxes payable/recoverable unfavorably impacted fiscal 2011 cash flows, as compared to fiscal 2010, by $203 million due to the timing of tax payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of $78 million in fiscal 2011 compared to cash provided of $31 million in fiscal 2010. We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, Bobs Stores and A.J. Wright. The majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations. The reserve balance was $45.4 million at January 28, 2012 and $54.7 million at January 29, 2011. The cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Investing activities: Our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended January In millions 2012 2011 2010 New stores $ 211.6 $ 196.3 $ 127.8 Store renovations and improvements 319.8 301.0 206.8 Office and distribution centers 271.9 209.8 94.7 Capital expenditures $ 803.3 $ 707.1 $ 429.3 33 We expect that we will spend approximately $875 million to $900 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2013, including approximately $415 million for our offices and distribution centers (including information systems) to support growth, $305 million for store renovations and $180 million for new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds. We also purchased short term investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented. In fiscal 2012, we purchased $152 million of such short term investments, compared to $120 million in fiscal 2011. Additionally, $133 million of such short term investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2012 compared to $180 million last year. Financing activities: Cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,336 million in fiscal 2012, $1,224 million in fiscal 2011 and $584 million in fiscal 2010. Under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1,370 million to repurchase 49.7 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2012, $1,201 million to repurchase 55.1 million shares in fiscal 2011 and $950 million to repurchase 54.0 million shares in fiscal 2010, all of which were retired. We record the purchase of our stock on a settlement basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases. All share information disclosed is on a post split basis. As of January 28, 2012, $225 million was available for purchase under the stock repurchase program approved in February 2011. On January 31, 2012, our Board of Directors approved an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of TJX stock. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2013. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of $774 million from two debt offerings. In April 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.95% ten year notes. In connection with this issuance, we called for the redemption of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes, virtually all of which were converted into 30.2 million shares of common stock. We used the proceeds of the 6.95% notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. In July 2009, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% six year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our C$235 million term credit facility in August 2009, prior to its scheduled maturity, and used the remainder, together with funds from operations, to pay our 7.45% notes on their scheduled maturity date in December 2009. We declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.38 per share in fiscal 2012, $0.30 per share in fiscal 2011 and $0.24 per share in fiscal 2010. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $275 million in fiscal 2012, $229 million in fiscal 2011 and $198 million in fiscal 2010. We announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $0.115 per share, effective with the dividend to be declared in April 2012 and payable in May 2012, subject to the approval and declaration of our Board of Directors. We also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $219 million in fiscal 2012, $176 million in fiscal 2011 and $170 million in fiscal 2010. We traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements primarily through cash generated from operations, short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper. We also have $1 billion in revolving credit facilities, which are described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our revolving credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year. 34 Contractual obligations: As of January 28, 2012, we had payment obligations (including current installments) under long term debt arrangements, leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations requiring cash outflows as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Long term debt obligations including estimated interest and current installments $ 1,037,669 $ 42,863 $ 85,725 $ 468,925 $ 440,156 Operating lease commitments 6,985,102 1,124,042 1,999,174 1,500,107 2,361,779 Capital lease obligation 15,322 3,912 7,824 3,586 Purchase obligations 2,486,221 2,466,278 19,690 210 43 Total Obligations $ 10,524,314 $ 3,637,095 $ 2,112,413 $ 1,972,828 $ 2,801,978 The long term debt obligations above include estimated interest costs. The operating lease commitments above are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2012. Purchase obligations include obligations under purchase orders for merchandise, capital items, supplies and other operating items, contracts for maintenance needs and other services, and executive employment and other agreements. Our purchase obligations do not include agreements that can be cancelled without penalty. We also have long term liabilities which include $302.2 million for employee compensation and benefits, the majority of which will come due beyond five years, $163.6 million for accrued rent, the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table, and $249.6 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below. Inventory valuation: We use the retail method for valuing inventory, which results in a weighted average cost. Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. This method is widely used in the retail industry, and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. Typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. However, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing managements discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. Thus, actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results, but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results. Overall, we believe that the retail method, coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end, results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated. Lastly, many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions that ultimately affect the value of inventory. We have generally not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations. Impairment of long lived assets: We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. Significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of 35 individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. If we determine that an impairment of long lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets. We believe as of January 28, 2012 that the carrying value of our long lived assets was appropriate. Retirement obligations: Retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. We are required to make assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets, both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. The discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, are two factors that can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. When the market performance of our plan assets, discount rates or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, we may make contributions to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. In fiscal 2012 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $75 million. Share based compensation: In accordance with GAAP, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. The fair value of the awards is amortized as share based compensation over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. The use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. Reserves for uncertain tax positions: Like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in a reduction to or additional accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Reserves for former operations: As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the Managements Discussion and Analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. We must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. The leases relating to A.J. Wright and other former operations are long term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the lease, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist 36 to any liability we may have. We develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. We believe that our reserves are reasonable estimates of the most likely outcomes of the future obligations arising out of the future obligations of our former operations and should be adequate to cover the ultimate costs we will incur. However, actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations. Loss contingencies: Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note A to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK TJX is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business, some potential market risks are discussed below: FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S. dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between our domestic and international operations. As more fully described in Note F to our consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments, primarily at our international operations, and intercompany transactions with our international operations. We enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure. We utilize currency forward and swap contracts, designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures. The contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency. As of January 28, 2012, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pre tax income for fiscal 2012 by approximately $42 million. INTEREST RATE RISK Our cash equivalents, short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us. In addition, changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense. We periodically use 37 financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing; however, we believe that fixed interest rates on most of our debt minimizes our exposure to changes in market conditions. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates applied to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of January 28, 2012. There were no variable rate borrowings outstanding as of January 28, 2012. The analysis indicated that such an adverse movement as of that date would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. EQUITY PRICE RISK The assets of our qualified pension plan, a large portion of which are equity securities, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets. We invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties. Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risks. A significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan, resulting in increased contributions to the plan. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
