Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to footnotes included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page F 11 of this report. Overview The company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. In January 2000, the company announced a major reorganization plan under which it planned to sell or spin off many noncore businesses. In 2001, the company modified the plan and sold its power generation business. As a result of these actions, the companys continuing operations solely include its instrument businesses. The results of the businesses that have been spun off, sold, or placed for sale have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. The companys continuing operations fall into three principal business segments: Life and Laboratory Sciences, Measurement and Control, and Optical Technologies. The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, restructuring, and discontinued operations. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value based on recent usage and expected demand. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) The company assesses the realizability of its notes receivable based on judgments concerning the borrowers ability to make the required payments. If the financial condition of the borrower were to deteriorate, charges to reduce the carrying value of notes receivable may be necessary.  (d) The company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using market comparables for similar businesses and forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary. (e) The company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other intangible assets may be necessary. (f) In instances where the company sells equipment with an obligation to install it at a customer site, the company assesses the complexity of the installation to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of the companys products and the related installation obligations changed so that installation were to become more complicated and lengthy, the company may be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of installation. (g) At the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (h) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances may be necessary. (i) The company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation and provides a reserve for these losses. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those reserves may be required. (j) The company records restructuring charges for asset impairment based on estimated future cash flows associated with the equipment and for the cost of vacating facilities based on expected sub rental income. Should actual cash flows associated with impaired equipment and sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (k) The company estimates the expected proceeds from the sale of its discontinued businesses and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated realizable value. Should the actual proceeds, which would include post closing purchase price adjustments, vary from estimates, actual results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations The discussion of operating income and operating income margin throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to amounts determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as amounts that exclude restructuring costs, gains and losses on the sale of businesses, and certain other items that are discussed by segment below and in more detail in Note 15. The company believes that this presentation, which is substantially consistent with how it measures its operating performance, provides information that investors may find useful as the items, while recurring in the years presented, vary significantly from period to period.  2002 Compared With 2001 Continuing Operations Sales in 2002 were $2.086 billion, a decrease of $101.9 million, or 5%, from 2001. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency translation, revenues decreased $101.3 million, or 5%. Currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues as discussed below by segment, due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the company operates. Operating income was $155.5 million in 2002, compared with $34.2 million in 2001. Segment operating income increased to $205.8 million in 2002 from $85.2 million in 2001. (Segment operating income is operating income excluding costs incurred at the companys corporate office.) Operating and segment operating income in 2002 were reduced by additional charges associated with a restructuring plans initiated during the fourth quarter of 2001, other restructuring actions initiated in 2002, and certain other costs, net (Note 15). Operating and segment operating income in 2001 were reduced by charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during 2001 and certain other charges, net. The restructuring and other items in both periods are discussed by segment below and in more detail in Note 15. Excluding the restructuring and other costs, which totaled $58.7 million in 2002 and $147.3 million in 2001, segment operating income was $264.5 million in 2002 and $232.4 million in 2001. The 2001 period included $40.2 million of goodwill amortization. Amortization of goodwill ceased following the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective in 2002 (Note 1). Excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other items, segment operating income totaled $272.7 million in 2001. Segment operating income excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other items decreased in 2002 due to lower revenues and the resulting reduced profitability at a number of businesses, discussed below, offset in part by the impact of cost reduction and productivity initiatives. In response to a continued downturn in semiconductor and other industrial markets served by the company, and in an effort to further integrate business units and reduce the number of real estate locations, the company continued restructuring initiatives in 2002 at a number of business units. The restructuring and related actions primarily consisted of headcount reductions, writedowns of production equipment and abandonment of leases for telecommunications products, and consolidation of facilities to streamline operations and reduce costs. These actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in late 2002 and continuing in early 2003 of approximately $43 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment, $13 million in the Measurement and Control segment, and $23 million in the Optical Technologies segment. The company expects to incur an additional $6 million of restructuring costs in 2003 for charges associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until incurred, such as relocation and moving costs. The company believes that restructuring actions undertaken in 2002 will be substantially completed by mid 2003. The company expects to identify additional sites to consolidate in 2003 and will record charges in connection with any such actions. Life and Laboratory Sciences Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $25.9 million to $1.140 billion in 2002. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $21.9 million in 2002. Sales decreased $0.5 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency translation, divestitures, and acquisitions, revenues grew nominally, increasing $4.5 million, or 0.4%. Increased demand for high end technology mass spectrometry equipment and histology and cytology products was offset in part by weakened demand for spectroscopy instruments and sample preparation products that had mid single digit percentage declines in sales, primarily due to lower capital spending. The company believes that many pharmaceutical customers, for example, are delaying purchases except for high end equipment where recent technological advances may provide a competitive advantage. Operating income margin increased to 15.6% in 2002 from 9.5% in 2001. (Operating income margin is segment operating income divided by segment revenues.) The segments operating income margin increased primarily due to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002 and higher restructuring and other costs in 2001, compared with 2002. Excluding restructuring and other costs, net, of $18.3  million in 2002 and $45.6 million in 2001, and goodwill amortization of $23.6 million in 2001, operating income margin was 17.2% in 2002 and 15.7% in 2001. The increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002 and, to a lesser extent, revenue growth of higher margin products. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other charges, net, of $18.3 million, including $11.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention at businesses being consolidated, and charges to cost of revenues of $0.7 million for the sale of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition and the discontinuation of a product line. In addition, the segment realized a net loss of $4.8 million on the sale of assets and small business units, principally its Dynex automated diagnostics product line, and wrote down $1.4 million of fixed assets at abandoned facilities (Note 15). Restructuring and other costs, net, in 2001 included cash costs of $27.3 million, primarily for severance and abandoned facilities; $8.3 million of asset writedowns; $6.9 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines; a charge of $3.4 million for the writeoff of in process research and development at an acquired business; $0.7 million of noncash severance costs; and $1.0 million of gains on the sale of a small business unit and a product line (Note 15). Measurement and Control Sales in the Measurement and Control segment decreased $61.9 million to $614.4 million in 2002. Sales decreased $29.4 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $8.4 million in 2002. Excluding the effect of divestitures, acquisitions, and currency translation, revenues decreased $40.9 million, or 7%. The decrease was due to a decline in revenues in each of the segments principal businesses, particularly the temperature control business, where over half of the decrease occurred. The overall revenue decline was due to economic conditions facing customers, particularly in the semiconductor, energy, and steel industries. The decrease in revenues was offset in part by an increase in sales of explosives detection equipment in the fourth quarter of 2002 following a congressional mandate to begin screening all checked airline baggage in the United States by the end of 2002. The company expects that a continued downturn in markets served by the segment will unfavorably affect the segments revenue comparisons with corresponding prior year periods in the near term. A prolonged downturn could adversely affect the realizability of the segments assets, which may result in charges for impairment. The principal divestitures by the segment included the July 2002 sale of Thermo BLH and Thermo Nobel, which manufacture and sell strain gauges, and were placed for sale in 2001 (Note 2); the August 2001 sale of its Pharos Marine unit, which manufactures and sells marine navigation equipment; the April 2001 sale of the CAC and Mid South businesses, which provide the oil and gas industry with wellhead safety and control products; and the July 2001 sale of its ThermoMicroscopes unit, a manufacturer of scanning probe microscopes. The principal acquisition by the segment included the July 2002 purchase of the radiation monitoring products business of Saint Gobain Corporation (Note 2). Operating income margin increased to 8.2% in 2002 from 2.5% in 2001, primarily due to significant restructuring and other costs in 2001, and the discontinuation of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002. Operating income margin, excluding restructuring and other costs, net, of $13.3 million in 2002 and $44.6 million in 2001, and goodwill amortization of $12.1 million in 2001, decreased to 10.3% in 2002 from 10.9% in 2001. The decrease in operating income margin resulted primarily from the decrease in revenues, offset in part by the effects of cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other charges, net, of $13.3 million, including $20.1 million of cash costs, principally for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention. In addition, the segment recorded $8.7 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of businesses, principally its Thermo BLH and Thermo Nobel subsidiaries. In 2002, the segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of $1.4 million for the sale of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition and $0.5 million of asset writedowns (Note 15). Restructuring and other costs, net,  in 2001 included $20.7 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and other exit costs; $12.0 million, net, for the loss on sale of businesses or writedowns of businesses subsequently sold; $8.2 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines; $3.6 million of asset writedowns; $1.0 million for impairment of a note receivable; and $0.2 million of other costs. These charges were offset in part by a gain of $1.1 million on the sale of a building (Note 15). Optical Technologies Sales in the Optical Technologies segment decreased $66.7 million to $342.2 million in 2002. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $1.6 million in 2002. Sales increased $0.6 million due to the acquisition of a product line, net of divestitures. Excluding the effect of currency translation, an acquisition, and divestitures, revenues decreased $65.7 million, or 16%. The decrease was due to a severe slowdown in the semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely affected all of the segments principal businesses. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is experiencing a downturn that began in 2001. The company expects that the slowdowns in semiconductor and other industrial markets will continue to result in unfavorable revenue comparisons with corresponding prior year periods in the near term. A prolonged downturn could adversely affect the realizability of the segments assets, which may result in charges for impairment. In the third quarter of 2002, following the companys acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Spectra Physics, the company conformed the Lasers divisions backlog policy to the prevailing practice at the companys other businesses of including in backlog only product orders that are expected to ship within six months. The Lasers divisions historical practice had been to include orders expected to ship within 12 months. This change resulted in a reduction of backlog of $39.3 million. Excluding the effect of this change, the segments backlog decreased 38% during 2002, and totaled $71.6 million as of December 28, 2002. Operating income margin was negative 6.5% in 2002, compared with negative 9.1% in 2001. Excluding restructuring and other costs, net, of $27.1 million in 2002 and $57.1 million in 2001, and goodwill amortization of $4.5 million in 2001, operating income margin was 1.5% in 2002 and 5.9% in 2001. The decrease in operating income margin was due to lower revenues at each of the segments principal businesses, particularly the lasers business (Spectra Physics), where the decline in revenues led to operating losses although the business operated profitably in the fourth quarter of 2002, excluding restructuring charges. The company initiated additional restructuring actions in this business in 2002, following those announced in the fourth quarter of 2001. These actions are discussed below and in Note 15. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other charges, net, of $27.1 million, including $10.7 million of cash costs, principally for severance and abandoned equipment leases associated with suspended telecom initiatives. The cash costs also included $0.7 million for the settlement of litigation (Note 11). In addition, this segment wrote off assets totaling $8.8 million, primarily for abandoned telecommunication and other manufacturing equipment. The segment also recorded a charge of $0.8 million resulting from the exchange of options to purchase shares of Spectra Physics for options to purchase shares of Thermo Electron following the acquisition of the minority interest in this business in February 2002 (Note 17). In 2002, the segment also recorded $7.0 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines. The charges described above were offset in part by a net gain of $0.2 million from the sale of a small business unit and land (Note 15). Restructuring and other costs, net, in 2001 included $24.0 million of asset writedowns, principally fixed assets associated with telecommunication initiatives; $22.1 million of cash costs for severance, lease obligations for abandoned equipment and facilities, litigation loss, and other exit costs; and $11.0 million of charges to cost of revenues for inventory writedowns (Note 15). Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $132.5 million and $36.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively (Note 4). Other income, net, includes interest income, interest expense, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, gain on investments, net, and other items, net. Interest income decreased to $47.9 million in 2002 from $68.5 million in 2001, primarily due to lower invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of  company securities, acquisitions, and, to a lesser extent, lower prevailing interest rates. The company expects that the lower market interest rates existing in 2003 will continue to adversely affect the yield it earns as maturing investments originally invested at higher rates are reinvested at current lower market rates. Following redemptions and repurchases of convertible obligations in 2002 (Note 10) and repurchases of the companys common stock, lower invested cash will also contribute to an expected reduction in interest income. Interest expense decreased to $40.9 million in 2002 from $71.8 million in 2001 as a result of the redemption, maturity, and repurchase of debentures, as well as entering into interest rate swap arrangements, offset in part by interest on borrowings under securities lending arrangements (Note 10). During 2002 and 2001, the company had gains on investments, net, of $123.1 million and $35.6 million, respectively. The gains included $111.4 million and $35.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, from the sale of shares of FLIR Systems, Inc. The company obtained an equity interest in FLIR as part of the acquisition of Spectra Physics AB in 1999. Of the total gain from the sale of FLIR shares, $39.5 million and $14.2 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, represent a recovery of amounts written down in prior years. Following a reduction in the companys percentage ownership of FLIR to less than 20%, the company no longer reports its pro rata share of FLIRs earnings but instead accounts for its remaining investment as an available for sale security (Note 4). Gains on investments in 2001 were reduced by a charge of $2.8 million to write down two available for sale securities due to impairment that the company deemed other than temporary. The company recorded income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $2.5 million in 2002 and $4.7 million in 2001, primarily related to the investment in FLIR through the first quarter of 2002. In 2001, other income, net, included $0.5 million of other expense, principally currency losses. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 32.3% and 38.1% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Excluding restructuring and other costs, net, and gains from the sale of FLIR shares, the effective tax rate was 31.0% and 38.1% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2002, primarily due to the absence of nondeductible goodwill amortization following the adoption of SFAS No. 142 and, to a lesser extent, a reorganization of the companys subsidiaries in several European countries that resulted in a more tax efficient corporate structure. The effective tax rate exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate in 2001 due to the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses, which included goodwill amortization. Excluding restructuring and other costs, net, and goodwill amortization, the effective tax rate was 33.1% in 2001. Minority Interest Income Minority interest income of $0.3 million and $5.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, represents minority shareholders allocable share of losses at Spectra Physics through the date on which the company acquired the minority interest in this subsidiary in February 2002 (Note 17). Contingent Liabilities At year end 2002, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described in Note 11 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $195.3 million in 2002, compared with $49.6 million in 2001. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of FLIR shares, and other items, discussed above. Excluding restructuring, gains on the sale of shares of FLIR, and other items in both periods, income from continuing operations before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to $164.4 million in 2002 from $122.4 million in 2001 due to the absence of goodwill amortization in 2002, offset in part by the reasons discussed above.  Extraordinary Item The company repurchased and redeemed debentures during 2002 and 2001, resulting in an extraordinary charge of $1.0 million, net of a tax benefit of $0.5 million, in 2002, and an extraordinary gain of $1.1 million, net of a tax provision of $0.6 million, in 2001 (Note 10). Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, in the first quarter of 2001, and recorded an after tax charge of $1.0 million representing the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Several recent accounting pronouncements may affect the companys financial statements in the future. These rule changes are summarized in Note 1. Discontinued Operations During 2002, primarily as a result of new tax regulations concerning deductible losses from divested businesses, the company revised its estimate of the tax consequences of business disposals in discontinued operations and recorded a tax benefit of $46.6 million. In addition, in 2002 the company sold its Trophy Radiologie business for $51 million in cash and principally as a result of this transaction recorded an after tax gain of $17.4 million. Also, the company sold the last remaining component of its former power generation business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition totaling $13.0 million, primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that were realized upon the sale. In February 2001, the company sold its interest in Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. to Thoratec Corporation in exchange for 19.3 million shares of Thoratec common stock. Certain restrictions, which lapsed in August 2002, limited the timing of the companys ability to sell these shares. The company recorded an after tax charge of $66.0 million in the first quarter of 2001 for a decline in market value of Thoratec common stock as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations. Following a sale of shares in February 2002 for net proceeds of $104 million and an after tax gain of $38.4 million, the company owned less than 20% of Thoratecs outstanding shares and began accounting for its investment as an available for sale security in continuing operations in the first quarter of 2002, with unrealized gains or losses recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying 2002 balance sheet (Note 17). In 2001, the company sold a substantial portion of its discontinued power generation business for net proceeds of $249 million and realized an after tax gain of $15.6 million on the disposition. The company is not currently aware of any known trends, events, or other uncertainties involving discontinued operations that it expects will cause the ultimate loss on disposal of discontinued operations to differ materially from the amounts recorded to date. Any difference from the amounts recorded would be reported as an adjustment to the ultimate loss on disposal of discontinued operations. 2001 Compared With 2000 Continuing Operations Sales in 2001 were $2.188 billion, a decrease of $92.3 million from 2000. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $113.5 million, or 5%. Currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues as discussed below by segment, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the company operates.  Operating income was $34.2 million in 2001, compared with $266.0 million in 2000. Segment operating income decreased to $85.2 million in 2001 from $319.8 million in 2000. Operating and segment operating income in 2001 were affected by restructuring and other costs. Operating and segment operating income in 2000 were affected by gains from the sale of businesses, offset in part by restructuring and other costs as well as a $1.7 million operating loss in the third quarter at a business that was sold. The restructuring and other items in both periods are discussed by segment below and in more detail in Note 15. Excluding the restructuring and other items, which totaled $147.3 million of expense in 2001 and $67.3 million of income in 2000, segment operating income was $232.4 million in 2001 and $252.5 million in 2000. Segment operating income, excluding restructuring and other items, decreased due to a reduction in segment operating income of $10.9 million from businesses divested. The company also recorded $2.3 million of incremental amortization expense in 2001, which resulted primarily from the purchase of the minority interests of formerly public subsidiaries in 2000, offset in part by lower amortization expense following a number of divestitures. In addition, certain businesses discussed below had lower profitability in 2001. The company undertook restructuring actions in 2001 to reduce costs in businesses affected by a severe slowdown in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries as well as other market sectors hurt by a slowing economy, including the U.S. steel and cement industries. The restructuring actions undertaken in 2001 were substantially completed by 2002. In addition to the actions to reduce costs, the company recorded an impairment charge for equipment used in telecommunication manufacturing at Spectra Physics. The company also recorded provisions for inventories related to the discontinuation of certain mature or unprofitable product lines and inventories made redundant by combining businesses and for excess telecommunication inventories at Spectra Physics. These actions resulted in annual cost reductions of approximately $63 million with approximately 40% beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the balance by the third quarter of 2002, including $20 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment, $22 million in the Measurement and Control segment, $18 million in the Optical Technologies segment, and $3 million at the companys corporate office. Life and Laboratory Sciences Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $67.7 million to $1.114 billion in 2001. Sales increased $17.9 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $28.1 million in 2001. Excluding the effect of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $77.9 million, or 7%. Approximately 40% of the increase was due to higher sales of mass spectrometry products used in proteomics and drug discovery research. Of the remaining increase, approximately two thirds was from increased sales of biosciences equipment, including sample preparation equipment and microplate and liquid handling products due to strong demand from the drug discovery market and expanded distribution channels. In addition, the segment reported higher revenues from clinical diagnostic products, including rapid diagnostic tests, as well as increased sales of spectroscopy instruments due to new product introductions. Operating income margin decreased to 9.5% in 2001 from 11.4% in 2000. The segments operating income margin in both periods was affected by restructuring and other charges, discussed below. Excluding restructuring and other costs, net, of $45.6 million in 2001 and $24.7 million in 2000, operating income margin was 13.6% in 2001 and 13.8% in 2000. The decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to an increase in goodwill amortization as a result of the purchase of the minority interests of formerly public subsidiaries. Excluding the additional amortization expense and the restructuring and other charges, operating income margin was 13.8% in 2001. Lower profitability due to research and development expenditures on proteomics initiatives was offset in part by the effect of higher revenues, discussed above. Restructuring and other costs, net, in 2001 included cash costs of $27.3 million, primarily for severance and abandoned facilities; $8.3 million of asset writedowns; $6.9 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines; a charge of $3.4 million for the writeoff of in process research and development at an acquired business; $0.7 million of noncash severance costs; and $1.0 million of gains on the sale of a small business unit and a product line (Note 15). Restructuring costs in 2000 represent $13.7 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines; $7.0 million of cash costs, primarily for severance and abandoned facilities; and $4.0 million of asset writedowns (Note 15).  Measurement and Control Sales in the Measurement and Control segment decreased $204.0 million to $676.3 million in 2001. Sales decreased $176.7 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $11.4 million in 2001. Excluding the effect of divestitures, acquisitions, and currency translation, revenues decreased $15.9 million, or 2%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to an 11% decrease in sales of temperature control products due to a severe market downturn in the semiconductor industry, and $12.7 million of lower sales of process instruments. The lower sales of process instruments primarily included weighing and inspection equipment due to competitive pressures, and equipment sold to the U.S. steel and cement industries due to a downturn in those markets. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an $8.8 million increase in sales of environmental monitoring equipment due in part to increased sales of chemical and radiation monitors as well as demand from the construction industry and upgrades of power plants. In April 2001, the segment sold businesses that contributed $4.4 million of the segments internal revenue growth in 2001. A downturn in some markets served by the segment resulted in a decline in revenues in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 compared with the same quarters of 2000. In 2001, the segments principal divestitures included Pharos Marine, ThermoMicroscopes, and the CAC and Mid South businesses. In 2000, the segments divestitures primarily included Spectra Precision, Nicolet Imaging Systems, and Sierra Research and Technology, Inc. (Note 2). Operating income margin decreased to 2.5% in 2001 from 20.6% in 2000, primarily due to restructuring and other charges, net, in 2001 and other income, net, in 2000. Operating income margin, excluding restructuring and other costs, net, of $44.6 million in 2001 and other income, net, of $98.1 million in 2000, decreased to 9.1% in 2001 from 9.5% in 2000. The decrease in operating income margin resulted primarily from lower profitability at the business units discussed above that had declining revenues, offset in part by the higher revenues from sales of environmental monitoring equipment discussed above together with cost reduction measures initiated in 2000 and 2001. Restructuring and other costs, net, in 2001 included $20.7 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and other exit costs; $12.0 million, net, for the loss on sale of businesses or writedowns of businesses subsequently sold; $8.2 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines; $3.6 million of asset writedowns; $1.0 million for impairment of a note receivable; and $0.2 million of other costs. These charges were offset in part by a gain of $1.1 million on the sale of a building (Note 15). The businesses for which the segment recorded a loss on or prior to sale were ThermoMicroscopes and Pharos Marine. In 2000, restructuring and other income, net, totaled $98.1 million and included gains on the sale of businesses, net, of $126.7 million, and the related operating loss of $1.7 million of one of the divested businesses in the third quarter of 2000 prior to its sale; $18.7 million of asset writedowns to reduce the carrying value of businesses held for sale to estimated disposal value and for fixed assets unique to certain discontinued products; $6.1 million of cash costs, primarily for severance and facility costs; charges to cost of revenues of $2.7 million, primarily for discontinued product lines; and a gain of $0.6 million from the termination of a lease (Note 15). Optical Technologies Sales in the Optical Technologies segment increased $45.0 million to $408.9 million in 2001. Sales decreased $0.4 million due to a divestiture, net of a small acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $7.0 million in 2001. Excluding the effect of a divestiture, an acquisition, and currency translation, revenues increased $52.4 million, or 14%. The increase in revenues was due in part to $37.5 million of increased demand for semiconductor based lasers used in industrial, research and development, and life sciences applications. The balance of the increase was due to higher sales in the first half of 2001 of molecular beam epitaxy systems and components to the semiconductor industry and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of photonics products including gratings and other optical components used in systems for lithography and telecommunication devices. Poor economic conditions in the telecommunications markets resulted in a decline in segment revenues in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 compared with the same quarters of 2000.  Operating income margin decreased to negative 9.1% in 2001 from 5.1% in 2000. Excluding restructuring and other costs of $57.1 million in 2001 and $6.0 million in 2000, operating income margin was 4.8% in 2001 and 6.8% in 2000. The decrease in operating income margin excluding restructuring and other costs was primarily due to $2.8 million of operating losses at Spectra Physics from its telecom product introductions and associated startup costs, compared with profitable operations in 2000. The decrease in operating income margin was also due to $0.9 million of higher goodwill amortization in 2001 following the purchase of the minority interests of formerly public subsidiaries in 2000. Restructuring and other costs, net, in 2001 included $24.0 million of asset writedowns, principally fixed assets associated with telecommunication initiatives; $22.1 million of cash costs for severance, lease obligations for abandoned equipment and facilities, litigation loss, and other exit costs; and $11.0 million of charges to cost of revenues for inventory writedowns (Note 15). Restructuring and other costs in 2000 represent $2.9 million of charges to cost of revenues principally for discontinued product lines, a $1.5 million writeoff of in process research and development at an acquired business, $1.1 million of cash costs, and $0.5 million of asset writedowns, primarily goodwill on a business held for sale (Note 15). Other Income (Expense), Net The company reported other income, net, of $36.5 million in 2001 and other expense, net, of $81.2 million in 2000 (Note 4). Interest income increased to $68.5 million in 2001 from $40.2 million in 2000, primarily due to proceeds from the sale of businesses, including discontinued operations, offset in part by cash used in 2000 and 2001 for the purchase of the minority interests of formerly public subsidiaries and in 2001 for repurchases of the companys debt and equity securities. Interest expense decreased to $71.8 million in 2001 from $83.1 million in 2000, as a result of the maturity and repurchase of debentures. The company recorded income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $4.7 million in 2001 and incurred a net equity loss of $47.3 million in 2000, primarily related to its investment in FLIR, which undertook significant restructuring actions in 2000. The company had gains on investments, net, of $35.6 million in 2001 and $6.8 million in 2000. The gain in 2001 includes $35.1 million from the sale of shares of FLIR. Of the total gain from the sale of FLIR, $14.2 million represents a recovery of previous writedowns of FLIR. The gain in 2001 was reduced by a charge of $2.8 million to write down two available for sale securities due to impairment that the company deemed other than temporary. In 2001, other income, net, includes $0.5 million of other expense, principally currency losses. In 2000, other expense, net, also includes $2.3 million of net currency gains, primarily resulting from hedging activities at Spectra Physics, which elected early adoption of SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 38.1% and 60.7% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Excluding the tax effect of restructuring and other costs or income and gains from the sale of shares of FLIR, the effective tax rate was 38.1% and 39.4% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The effective tax rate exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate in both periods due to the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses, including amortization of goodwill. Minority Interest Income (Expense) The company recorded minority interest income of $5.8 million in 2001 and minority interest expense of $10.6 million in 2000, representing minority shareholders allocable share of subsidiary losses or earnings. Minority interest expense decreased due to the purchase in 2000 of the minority interest in all of the companys formerly public subsidiaries in continuing operations except Spectra Physics (Note 17). In 2001, Spectra Physics incurred a loss and minority interest income represents the minority shareholders share of the loss.  Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $49.6 million in 2001, compared with $62.0 million in 2000. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of shares of FLIR, and other items, discussed above. Excluding the restructuring, gains on the sale of shares of FLIR, and other items in both periods, income from continuing operations before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to $122.4 million in 2001 from $100.0 million in 2000 due to the reasons discussed above. Extraordinary Item The company repurchased debentures during 2001 and 2000, resulting in extraordinary gains of $1.1 million, net of taxes of $0.6 million, in 2001, and $0.5 million, net of taxes of $0.3 million, in 2000 (Note 10). Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, in the first quarter of 2001 and recorded a charge representing the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of $1.0 million, net of an income tax benefit of $0.7 million (Note 1). In addition, in accordance with the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," the company adopted the pronouncement as of January 2, 2000, and recorded a charge in the first quarter of 2000 representing the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of $12.9 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.5 million and minority interest of $0.5 million (Note 16). Discontinued Operations The company recorded a provision of $66.0 million, net of taxes, in the first quarter of 2001 for a decline in market value of Thoratec common stock as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations. The Thoratec shares were obtained in February 2001 upon the sale of the companys interest in Thermo Cardiosystems. In June 2001, the company sold a substantial portion of its discontinued power generation business for net proceeds of $249 million and realized an after tax gain of $15.6 million on the disposition. The company recorded a provision of $100 million, net of taxes, in 2000 as a revision to the estimate of loss on disposal of discontinued operations recorded in 1999. The increase in the loss resulted from lower after tax proceeds from the sale of noncore businesses than had been anticipated at the time the businesses were discontinued. The company believes that deterioration in the financial markets in the latter part of 2000, including tighter financing terms and lower equity values, adversely affected the selling prices of the discontinued businesses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $667.8 million at December 28, 2002, compared with $823.2 million at December 29, 2001. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents, and short term available for sale investments of $875.5 million at December 28, 2002, compared with $1.042 billion at December 29, 2001. In addition, the company had $9.4 million of long term available for sale investments at December 29, 2001. 2002 Cash provided by operating activities was $102.9 million during 2002, including $112.4 million provided by continuing operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs, and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $44.2 million, net of taxes, in 2002. Aside from cash used for restructuring actions, a decrease in other current liabilities used cash of $71.6 million, including $44.8 million of income tax payments and $10.8 million of accrued interest, principally due to the debt redemption discussed in Note 10. The income tax payments include approximately $39.0 million related to gains on investments. The use of cash of $9.5 million from discontinued operations was principally due to the payment of liabilities, primarily for the settlement of litigation, including a patent infringement matter (Note 11), offset in part by cash from tax benefits associated with discontinued operations.  In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $41.6 million for restructuring costs at December 28, 2002. The company expects to pay $22.2 million of this amount for severance, employee retention, and other costs primarily through 2003. The balance of $19.4 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 71% to be paid through 2003 and the remainder through 2012. In addition, at December 28, 2002, the company had accrued $8.8 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $1.8 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through the third quarter of 2003. The balance primarily represents abandoned facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014. During 2002, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included the sale of other investments, acquisitions and divestitures, the collection of notes receivable, the purchase of shares of a majority owned subsidiary, and the purchase of property, plant, and equipment. The companys continuing operations received proceeds of $65.5 million from the sale of other investments, principally shares of FLIR (Note 4), and proceeds of $23.6 million from the sale of businesses, net of cash divested (Note 2). In addition, the companys continuing operations expended $78.7 million for acquisitions (Note 2), $23.2 million to purchase the remaining minority owned shares of its Spectra Physics subsidiary (Note 17), and $40.2 million for purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of dispositions. The companys continuing operations collected $76.4 million from notes receivable, which included the repayment of Viasys Healthcares $33.4 million principal amount note in May 2002, the August 2002 repayment of a $25.0 million principal amount note receivable related to the sale of a business in 2000, and partial repayment from Trimble Navigation Limited in March 2002 (Note 2). During 2002, investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $151.0 million of cash, primarily representing proceeds of $104 million from the sale of Thoratec common stock (Note 17) and the sale of Trophy Radiologie. The companys financing activities used $593.0 million of cash during 2002, including $592.7 million for continuing operations. During 2002, the companys continuing operations expended $590.7 million to redeem certain convertible debentures. The company increased short term notes payable by $311.1 million to partially fund debt redemptions (Note 10). The companys continuing operations received net proceeds of $25.3 million from the exercise of employee stock options. During 2002, the company expended $334.2 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, of which $285.6 million was expended to repurchase 15.4 million shares of the companys common stock. As of December 28, 2002, the company had approximately $62 million remaining under Board of Directors authorizations to repurchase its own securities. In February 2003, the companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $100 million tranche of its own debt and equity securities through February 26, 2004. In December 2002, the company entered into arrangements under which the company may borrow up to $250 million for working capital needs and possible acquisitions (Note 10). 2001 Cash provided by operating activities was $188.4 million in 2001, including $184.4 million from continuing operations. Accounts receivable used $19.0 million of cash, principally as a result of strong fourth quarter revenue growth in 2001 over the fourth quarter of 2000 at the companys Life and Laboratory Sciences segment. Accounts payable decreased $19.1 million primarily due to a lower volume of purchasing activities resulting from slowdowns in several businesses. Other current liabilities increased by $50.5 million, including $39.7 million of restructuring reserves and $10.2 million of accrued interest, due to the timing of payments. During 2001, the companys investing activities expended $73.2 million, net of dispositions, for purchases of property, plant, and equipment; $69.5 million for the purchase of shares of a majority owned subsidiary; and $14.1 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash divested, of $46.8 million, and $43.3 million for the sale of other investments, principally shares of FLIR.  The companys financing activities used $696.3 million of cash during 2001, including $503.0 million for continuing operations. The companys continuing operations expended $43.1 million for the repayment of long term obligations and received net proceeds of $69.9 million from the exercise of employee stock options. In addition, the company expended $511.4 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities in 2001. During 2001, the companys discontinued operations used $193.3 million of cash, including cash at the companys Kadant subsidiary, which was spun off in August 2001, and for the repayment of debt. 2000 Cash provided by operating activities was $199.9 million in 2000, including $57.8 million from continuing operations. Cash of $77.4 million was used to fund an increase in inventories in response to growth at certain of the companys business units. Of the total increase in inventories, $14.5 million resulted from the adoption of SAB No. 101. Accounts receivable used $27.4 million of cash due to increased revenues. The increase in receivables was reduced by $21.6 million due to the adoption of SAB No. 101. Other current liabilities increased by $48.0 million, including $15.5 million of restructuring reserves and $29.1 million of accrued income taxes. During 2000, the companys investing activities expended $307.2 million to acquire the minority interest of certain majority owned subsidiaries; $74.0 million, net of dispositions, for purchases of property, plant, and equipment; and $15.8 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash divested, of $253.6 million. During 2000, investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $394.6 million, primarily representing proceeds from the sale of businesses. The companys financing activities used $137.6 million of cash during 2000, including $155.5 million for continuing operations. The companys continuing operations expended $161.2 million for the repayment of long term obligations, $29.2 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, and $14.6 million to purchase debentures of certain of the companys majority owned subsidiaries. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 28, 2002, which are principally for its continuing operations. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment Less than After 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Total (In thousands) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Long term obligations $117,144 $228,366 $ 78,471 $144,504 $568,485 Operating leases 40,312 89,356 20,017 83,072 232,757 Total contractual obligations 157,456 317,722 98,488 227,576 801,242 Other Commitments: Standby letters of credit 40,549 3,676 161 169 44,555 Guarantees 25,166 2,023 8 4 27,201 Total other commitments 65,715 5,699 169 173 71,756 $223,171 $323,421 $ 98,657 $227,749 $872,998  The company does not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques except for operating leases and other commitments disclosed in the previous table. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant, and equipment and expects that for 2003, such expenditures will approximate $55 to $60 million. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Forward looking Statements In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers that the following important factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual results in 2003 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us. We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change, and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development, including in the area of proteomics. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions, and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services, and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test, and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels. These activities require us to make significant investments. Products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can. The products that we are currently developing, or those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete. We sell our products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries, which would adversely affect our results of operations when those industries experience a downturn. The growth and profitability of some of our businesses depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns and are experiencing slowing trends. For example, our Optical Technologies segment depends in part on sales to the semiconductor industry and our Measurement and Control segment depends in part on sales to the steel and cement industries. A continued slowdown in these industries would adversely affect sales by these segments, which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.  Our business is adversely impacted by the continuing general worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Continuing adverse economic conditions worldwide could adversely impact our business in 2003 and beyond, resulting in: reduced demand for some of our products; increased rate of order cancellations or delays; increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories; increased pressure on the prices for our products and services; and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable. For example, continued softness in the laboratory equipment, industrial manufacturing, and semiconductor markets could adversely affect our future operating results. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local, and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure, and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include manufacturers of semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.  Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold. From 1997 through 2002, we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of $2 billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such as lawsuits, product liability claims, and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however, we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. We face a number of challenges in integrating and consolidating our businesses. We have historically operated our businesses largely as autonomous, unaffiliated operations. For the past few years, we have been consolidating our operations and managing them in a more coordinated manner. The following factors may make it difficult to successfully complete the integration and consolidation of our operations: Our success in integrating our businesses depends on our ability to coordinate or consolidate geographically separate organizations and integrate personnel with different business backgrounds and corporate cultures. Our ability to combine our businesses requires coordination of previously autonomous administrative, sales and marketing, distribution, and accounting and finance functions, and expansion and integration of information and management systems. The integration and consolidation process could be disruptive to our businesses. Moreover, we may not be able to realize all of the cost savings and other benefits that we expect to result from the integration and consolidation process. Our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future savings from new sourcing initiatives. As part of our corporate consolidation over the past two years, we have undertaken significant real estate consolidations and cost savings initiatives relating to sourcing materials and services purchased by us throughout our businesses. While we anticipate continued significant savings from additional sourcing initiatives and further real estate consolidations, future savings opportunities may be fewer and smaller in size, and may be more difficult to achieve. Implementation of our new branding strategy may be difficult and could adversely affect our business. We historically operated our business largely as autonomous, unaffiliated companies and as a result each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names. We are implementing a new marketing and branding strategy which involves the transition from multiple, unrelated brands to two brands, Thermo Electron and Spectra Physics. Several of our existing brands such as Finnigan, Nicolet, and Oriel command strong market recognition and customer loyalty. We believe the transition to the two new brands will enhance and strengthen our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company. Our success in transitioning our brands depends on many factors, including effective communication of the transition to our customers, acceptance and recognition by customers  of these new brands, and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams. If we are not successful in implementing this strategy and transitioning our brands, we may experience erosion in our product recognition, brand image and customer loyalty, and a decrease in demand for our products. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: finding new markets for our products, including in the area of proteomics; developing new applications for our technologies; combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; actively funding research and development; commencing key customer initiatives; strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; and developing commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business. We have significant international operations, which entail the risk that exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect demand for our products and our profitability. International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In 2002, our international revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues from the United States, accounted for approximately 52% of our total revenues. International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. For example, while in fiscal 2002, currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $28.7 million, in fiscal 2001, the unfavorable effects of currency translation decreased revenues of our continuing operations by $46.5 million. We have acquired several companies and businesses; as a result we have recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet, which we must continually evaluate for potential impairment. We have acquired significant intangible assets, including approximately $1.4 billion of goodwill that we have recorded on our balance sheet as of December 28, 2002. We assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the companys currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The companys forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen, and Swiss francs. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the companys short and long term available for sale investments and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2002 and 2001 market interest rates would result in a negative impact to the company of $2 million and $9 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments. A 100 basis point increase in 90 day LIBOR at December 28, 2002, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by $4 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company generally views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as long term. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2002 and 2001 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $76 million and $72 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year end 2002 and 2001 currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $3.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2002 and 2001 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, on the companys net income.  Equity Prices The companys available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2002 market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of $9 million on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments, principally its available for sale investments. A 10% increase in the year end 2001 market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of $7 million on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments, principally its convertible obligations.
