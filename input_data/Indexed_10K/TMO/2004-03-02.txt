Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to footnotes included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F 1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. During 2000 and 2001, the company carried out the principal aspects of a major reorganization plan under which it sold or spun off many noncore businesses. As a result of these actions, the companys continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument businesses. The businesses that have been spun off and sold have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. The companys continuing operations fall into three principal business segments: Life and Laboratory Sciences, Measurement and Control, and Optical Technologies. The company has historically moved a business unit between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the business unit or a segment more closely aligns the business unit with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported. Revenues 2003 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Life and Laboratory Sciences $1,291,430 61.6% $1,204,232 57.7% Measurement and Control 606,197 28.9% 636,025 30.5% Optical Technologies 211,758 10.1% 258,640 12.4% Intersegment (12,250) (0.6%) (12,542) (0.6%) $2,097,135 100% $2,086,355 100% The companys revenues grew nominally in 2003. The strengthening of non U.S. currencies relative to the dollar caused an increase in reported revenues, offset by lower demand in several businesses in the companys Measurement and Control and Optical Technologies segments. In addition to the change in revenues caused by currency translation and divestitures, net of acquisitions, which are discussed below, sales decreased 5% in 2003, primarily due to lower demand. The company also reported this same percentage revenue decrease in 2002 compared with 2001. The most recent year in which the company reported positive comparative sales growth was 2001 compared with 2000. The trend of lower sales has resulted primarily from a slowdown in the worldwide economy that has adversely affected capital spending across most markets addressed by the company. Fourth quarter 2003 results suggest the trend of lower sales is reversing. For example, the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment reported higher fourth quarter sales over the year ago quarter, while the Optical Technologies segment had sequential sales growth over the third quarter and increased its backlog 11% in the quarter. The Measurement and Control segment increased its backlog at year end 2003 by 3% over that of a year ago.  The companys strategy over time is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2003. These acquisitions included Jouan SA, a manufacturer of products used to prepare and preserve laboratory samples, which was acquired on December 31, 2003; Laboratory Management Services, Inc., a supplier of regulatory instrument and consulting services to the pharmaceutical and related industries; and the personal radiation detection instruments product line from Siemens plc. In 2003, the companys operating income and operating income margin improved to $184.8 million and 8.8%, respectively, from $155.5 million and 7.5%, respectively, in 2002. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) During the economic slowdown, the company undertook actions to reduce its cost structure and promote operating efficiency, principally through consolidating real estate locations and reducing related headcount. The annualized cost savings of actions initiated in 2003 and 2002 total approximately $58 million. As these actions were taken during periods of declining revenues, the corresponding income benefit was offset in part by the effect on income of lower sales. Restructuring and other costs, net, reduced pre tax income by $48.8 million and $61.3 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income from continuing operations declined to $172.7 million in 2003, from $194.4 million in 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from an $87.6 million pre tax decrease in gains on sale of investments in 2003. The company had a large equity interest in FLIR Systems, Inc. resulting from shares acquired as part of an acquisition completed in 1999. The company sold shares of FLIR and had significant gains in 2002 and, to a lesser extent, in 2003. As of the end of 2003, the company no longer owned shares of FLIR. The 2003 investment gains also included gains from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation. As of the end of 2003, the company owned 5.7 million shares of Thoratec with a fair market value of $74 million. The company obtained the shares of Thoratec in 2001 as consideration for a divestiture. The company has reduced its effective tax rate over the past two years. In 2003, the tax rate was 21.0%, which included some benefits discussed below that the company does not expect to have in 2004. Several initiatives, however, will continue to provide a benefit in the future, principally a reorganization of the companys non U.S. subsidiary structure that has resulted in a more tax efficient corporate structure. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2004 will be approximately 28% 29%. During 2003, the companys cash flow from operations totaled $216.7 million, compared with $110.3 million in 2002. In 2002, cash of $85.2 million was used to reduce other current liabilities, including tax payments on investment gains. In 2003, a decrease in other current liabilities used cash of $7.5 million, resulting in a year over year difference of $77.7 million. In addition, decreases in accounts receivable and inventories in 2003 generated $20.3 million more cash than did decreases in these accounts in 2002. During 2003, the company used cash of $665.6 million for financing activities, principally the repayment of short term debt as well as the early redemption of long term obligations with the objective of reducing interest costs. As of year end 2003, the companys outstanding debt totaled $275.5 million, of which 82% is due in 2007 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and investments of $418.2 million as of December 31, 2003, and its future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to $250 million under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, restructuring, and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions, and other  assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $26.1 million at December 31, 2003. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer, and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value based on usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand, and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) The company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using market comparables for similar businesses or forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Goodwill totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2003. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels, and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary. (d) The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $436.5 million at December 31, 2003, including $300.7 million of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (e) In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. (f) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. (g) At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $29.6 million at December 31, 2003. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary.  (h) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $75.3 million at December 31, 2003. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. (i) The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $100.2 million at December 31, 2003. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should disputed positions that are reserved ultimately be sustained, the company would recognize an incremental tax benefit. (j) The company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation and provides a reserve for these losses. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those reserves may be required. (k) One of the companys U.S. subsidiaries and several non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with the companys actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for defined benefit plans totaled $7.5 million in 2003. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs. (l) The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income. The companys accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities totaled $14.7 million at December 31, 2003. Should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (m) The company estimates the expected proceeds from any businesses held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations 2003 Compared With 2002 Continuing Operations Sales in 2003 were $2.097 billion, an increase of $10.8 million from 2002. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $120.8 million in 2003. Sales decreased $10.6 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenues decreased $99.4 million, or 5%, primarily due to lower demand, as described by segment below. Operating Income Margin 2003 2002 Life and Laboratory Sciences 14.1% 14.4% Measurement and Control 7.3% 7.2% Optical Technologies (5.5%) (12.0%) Consolidated 8.8% 7.5%  Operating income was $184.8 million in 2003, compared with $155.5 million in 2002. Operating income margin increased to 8.8% in 2003 from 7.5% in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was reduced by additional charges associated with restructuring actions initiated in 2003, restructuring plans initiated prior to 2003, and certain other costs, net (Note 15). Operating income in 2002 was reduced by charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during 2002 and 2001, and certain other costs, net. The restructuring and other items totaled $48.8 million and $61.3 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are discussed by segment below. Operating income increased primarily due to a lower cost base following recent restructuring actions. Among the other actions contributing to a lower cost base is lower spending on research and development activities, which decreased 6% to $146.4 million in 2003 as the company focuses on those projects with the highest estimated returns. The company expects to continue spending on research and development at a rate of approximately 7% of revenues. In response to a continued downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the companys overall reorganization, restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. These actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in mid to late 2003 and continuing in early 2004 of approximately $15 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment, $4 million in the Measurement and Control segment, and $4 million in the Optical Technologies segment. The company expects to incur an additional $3 million of restructuring costs, primarily in 2004, for charges associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until incurred. The company believes that restructuring actions undertaken in 2003 will be substantially completed in 2004. The company does not currently expect to undertake significant restructuring actions in 2004. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF No. 00 21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The company began applying the consensus prospectively in the first quarter of 2003. Under EITF No. 00 21, the company recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered or completed based on its fair value. When a portion of the customers payment is not due until installation, the company defers that portion of the revenue until completion of installation. Prior to 2003, the company followed Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," adopted in 2000, for multiple element arrangements. Under SAB No. 101, revenue was recognized at shipment with the estimated cost of installation accrued for most products requiring installation. For those products requiring installations of longer duration, the company previously deferred revenue until completion of installation. The adoption of EITF No. 00 21 increased revenues and diluted earnings per share by $7.6 million and $.01, respectively, during the first quarter of 2003. Where EITF No. 00 21 has had an impact, the company has disclosed such impact. Life and Laboratory Sciences 2003 2002 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $1,291,430 $1,204,232 7.2% Operating Income Margin 14.1% 14.4% (0.3%) Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $87.2 million, or 7%, to $1.291 billion in 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $86.3 million in 2003. Sales decreased $9.7 million due to product line divestitures, net of acquisitions. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, divestitures, and acquisitions, revenues increased $10.6 million, or 0.9%, including 0.5% from the effect of the adoption of EITF No. 00 21. A $14.8 million increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products was offset in part by decreased sales of bioscience instrumentation, principally due to a downturn in demand from pharmaceutical and industrial markets. The increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products resulted primarily from higher demand for rapid diagnostic tests during a harsh flu season in the United States and, to a lesser extent, increased demand for a newly released tissue processor used in anatomical pathology laboratories.  Operating income margin decreased to 14.1% in 2003 from 14.4% in 2002. Operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $21.8 million and $19.2 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition to the increase in restructuring and other costs in 2003, the decrease in operating income margin resulted from higher marketing and selling expenses due to several key commercial initiatives. The segments commercial initiatives include key customer account management, increased advertising costs for a branding transition, and establishment of customer call centers and product demonstration facilities. These cost increases were offset in part by cost savings from facility consolidations and related productivity measures. The cost reduction measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately $14 million on an annualized basis. In 2003, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $21.8 million, including $18.8 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention, and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded net charges of $3.4 million to write down the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily buildings held for sale, to expected disposal value, offset by $0.4 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of a product line. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million, including $12.2 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention at businesses being consolidated. The segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $1.3 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. In addition, the segment realized a net loss of $4.3 million on the sale of assets, principally its Dynex automated diagnostics product line, and wrote down $1.4 million of fixed assets at abandoned facilities (Note 15). Measurement and Control 2003 2002 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $606,197 $636,025 (4.7%) Operating Income Margin 7.3% 7.2% 0.1% Sales in the Measurement and Control segment decreased $29.8 million, or 5%, to $606.2 million in 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $30.1 million in 2003. Sales increased $3.3 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenues decreased $63.2 million, or 10%. Of this amount, $26.8 million, or 4%, was due to the inclusion in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a shipment of explosives detection equipment to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration following a congressional mandate to screen all checked airline baggage in the United States by the end of 2002. The balance of the decrease was primarily the result of weaker demand arising from economic conditions facing customers, particularly in the process instruments businesses where approximately 60% of the remaining decrease occurred. Process instruments are generally used in industrial markets such as minerals and mining and petrochemical applications, where capital expenditures have slowed. In addition, a 7% decrease in sales of equipment used primarily in semiconductor applications was offset in part by higher revenues from equipment used in homeland security. Operating income margin increased to 7.3% in 2003 from 7.2% in 2002. Operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $10.3 million and $13.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from cost reduction measures following restructuring actions in 2002 and 2003 and, to a lesser extent, $3.3 million of lower restructuring and other costs, net, offset in part by the effect on operating margin of lower revenues. The cost reduction measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately $17 million on an annualized basis.  The company completed its annual analysis of the segments goodwill in December 2003 and determined that no impairment existed. Several of the segments businesses are cyclical, and their results follow closely the business trends of industries such as semiconductor and oil and gas, which have slowed capital spending since 2001. Although recent industry and internal indicators (such as year end backlog growth in the segment of 3% over 2002) suggest the downturn may be reversing, were the downward year over year sales trend of 2001 to 2003 to continue for an extended period of time, the segments goodwill may become impaired. The segments goodwill totaled $414 million at the end of 2003. In 2003, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $10.3 million, including cash costs of $10.3 million, principally for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention, and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded charges of $2.0 million, primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to reduce the carrying value to disposal value, and for the writedown of assets at facilities being consolidated, offset by a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of a building. The segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $0.1 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $13.6 million, including $20.4 million of cash costs principally for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention. In addition, the segment recorded $8.7 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of its Thermo BLH and Thermo Nobel subsidiaries, which were noncore businesses held for sale since 2001. In 2002, the segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of $1.4 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $0.5 million of asset writedowns (Note 15). Optical Technologies 2003 2002 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $211,758 $258,640 (18.1%) Operating Income Margin (5.5%) (12.0%) 6.5% Sales in the Optical Technologies segment decreased $46.9 million, or 18%, to $211.8 million in 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $4.4 million in 2003. Sales decreased $4.2 million as a result of two product line divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and divestitures, revenues decreased $47.1 million, or 19%, primarily due to weaker demand. The weaker demand was principally the result of the severe slowdown in the semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely affected customers in the segments businesses. These industries are highly cyclical and have experienced downturns that began in 2001. Research funding for the scientific laser market has also remained slow and this, together with the downturn in industrial markets, has heightened competition in sales to academic and research customers. Operating income margin was negative 5.5% in 2003, compared with negative 12.0% in 2002. Operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $11.6 million and $25.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in the segments operating loss was principally due to cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in 2002 and 2003, the suspension of telecommunications activities in the second quarter of 2002 and, to a lesser extent, lower restructuring and other costs. These were offset in part by the impact of lower revenues. The cost reduction measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately $27 million on an annualized basis. The company completed its annual analysis of the segments goodwill in December 2003 and determined that no impairment existed. The segments businesses are cyclical, and their results follow closely the business trends of industries such as semiconductor and other industrial markets that have slowed capital spending since 2001. Although recent industry and internal indicators (such as 9% sequential fourth quarter sales growth in the segment over the preceding quarter) suggest the downturn is reversing, were the downward year over year sales trend of 2001 to 2003 to continue for an extended period of time, the segments goodwill may become impaired. The segments goodwill totaled $122 million at the end of 2003.  In 2003, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $11.6 million, including cash costs of $5.8 million, principally for abandoned facilities and severance and related costs for terminated employees. These charges were offset by a gain of $1.0 million for the reversal of contract cancellation fees that were disputed and ultimately not required. In addition, the segment recorded a charge of $4.8 million, primarily for the writedown to disposal value of a noncore product line that was sold in October 2003. The segment also recorded charges of $2.0 million including the writedown of a facility held for sale to estimated disposal value, and abandoned assets, net of recoveries. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $25.9 million, including $9.7 million of cash costs, principally for severance and abandoned equipment leases associated with suspended telecom initiatives. The cash costs also included $0.7 million for the settlement of litigation. In addition, this segment wrote off assets totaling $8.8 million, primarily for abandoned telecommunication and other manufacturing equipment. This segment also recorded a charge of $0.8 million resulting from employee options to purchase shares of Spectra Physics becoming options to purchase shares of Thermo Electron following the acquisition of the minority interest in this business in February 2002. In 2002, the segment also recorded $6.5 million of charges to cost of revenues for two discontinued product lines and a charge of $0.1 million for the loss on the sale of a small business unit (Note 15). Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $33.9 million and $131.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively (Note 4). Other income, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, and other items, net. Interest income decreased to $19.7 million in 2003 from $47.9 million in 2002, primarily due to lower invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of company securities and the payment of short term notes payable and, to a lesser extent, lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense decreased to $18.7 million in 2003 from $40.9 million in 2002 as a result of the redemption, maturity, and repurchase of debentures, as well as the full year effect of entering into interest rate swap arrangements in the first quarter of 2002, offset in part by interest on borrowings under securities lending arrangements. The company expects that interest expense will exceed interest income in 2004, continuing the trend of the second half of 2003. During 2003 and 2002, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35.5 million and $123.1 million, respectively. The gains included $16.3 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and $13.7 million and $111.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, from the sale of shares of FLIR. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 (Note 16) and obtained an equity interest in FLIR as part of the acquisition of Spectra Physics AB in 1999. Of the total gain from the sale of FLIR shares, $3.9 million and $31.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, represent a recovery of amounts written down in prior years when the company deemed an impairment of its investment in FLIR to be other than temporary. The company recorded income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $2.5 million in 2002, primarily related to the investment in FLIR. Effective March 30, 2002, following a reduction in the companys percentage ownership of FLIR to less then 20%, the company no longer reported its pro rata share of FLIR earnings but instead accounted for its remaining investment as an available for sale security (Note 4). In addition, the company repurchased and redeemed debentures, resulting in charges of $1.0 million and $1.5 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 21.0% and 32.3% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2003 primarily due to $9.0 million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards (Note 6) and $3.7 million of tax benefit from the sale of a business. These tax benefits reduced the companys 2003 effective tax rate by 5.8%. The decrease was also due in part to the full year impact on the 2003 effective tax rate of a reorganization throughout 2002 of the companys subsidiaries in several European countries that resulted in a more tax efficient corporate structure and a decrease in 2003 of gains from the sale of investment securities. In addition, the company reduced its effective tax rate by 1.8% in 2003 through repatriation of cash from non U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in foreign tax credits. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2004 will be approximately 28% 29%.  In the normal course of business, the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS has concluded its field examination for the tax years 1997 through 2000 as part of its routine examinations of the companys income tax returns. At the conclusion of the field examination, several issues were unresolved and are currently being reviewed at the Appeals Office of the IRS. In 2004, the company expects to resolve the disputed issues and complete the examination. Although the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, management believes that it may reach favorable settlement of the examinations upon completion of the appellate review by the IRS. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of cash. Favorable resolution would result in a reduction to the companys effective tax rate in the quarter of resolution. Any additional impact on the companys liability for income taxes cannot presently be determined; however, the company believes its accrued income tax liabilities are adequate. Contingent Liabilities At year end 2003, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in the matter described in Note 11 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $172.7 million in 2003, compared with $194.4 million in 2002. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of Thoratec and FLIR shares, and other items, discussed above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Several recent accounting pronouncements may affect the companys financial statements in the future. These rule changes are summarized in Note 1. The company announced its intention to begin recording the effect of stock options in its consolidated statement of operations in 2005 when final Financial Accounting Standards Board rules are expected to become effective. Discontinued Operations The company had after tax gains of $27.3 million in 2003 and $115.4 million in 2002 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The 2003 gain consists of two pre tax components and two tax components. In 2003, the company resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained following the sale of businesses in its discontinued operations. In connection with the resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages estimated and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease obligations, the companys pre tax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of the related businesses increased by $27.1 million. In 2003, the company also sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations, Peter Brotherhood Ltd., and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior to 2003, including post closing purchase price adjustments. The company recorded pre tax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of $8.3 million, substantially as a result of these transactions. The company recorded a tax provision of $13.2 million on the above gains and realized $5.1 million of additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003, principally foreign tax credits. During 2002, primarily as a result of new tax regulations concerning deductible losses from divested businesses, the company revised its estimate of the tax consequences of business disposals in discontinued operations and recorded a tax benefit of $46.6 million. In addition, in 2002 the company sold its Trophy Radiologie business for approximately $51 million in cash and, principally as a result of this transaction, recorded an after tax gain of $17.4 million. Also, the company sold the last remaining component of its former power generation business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition totaling $13.0 million, primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that were realized upon the sale.  In February 2001, the company sold its interest in Thermo Cardiosystems to Thoratec in exchange for 19.3 million shares of Thoratec common stock. Certain restrictions, which lapsed in August 2002, limited the timing of the companys ability to sell these shares. The company recorded an after tax charge of $66.0 million in the first quarter of 2001 for a decline in market value of Thoratec common stock as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations. Following a sale of shares in February 2002 for net proceeds of $104 million and an after tax gain of $38.4 million, the company owned less than 20% of Thoratecs outstanding shares and began accounting for its investment as an available for sale security in continuing operations in the first quarter of 2002, with unrealized gains or losses recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying balance sheet (Note 16). 2002 Compared With 2001 Continuing Operations Revenues 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Life and Laboratory Sciences $1,204,232 57.7% $1,173,032 53.6% Measurement and Control 636,025 30.5% 705,093 32.2% Optical Technologies 258,640 12.4% 323,888 14.8% Intersegment (12,542) (0.6%) (13,803) (0.6%) $2,086,355 100% $2,188,210 100% Sales in 2002 were $2.086 billion, a decrease of $101.9 million, or 5%, from 2001. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $28.7 million in 2002. Sales decreased $29.3 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenue decreased $101.3 million, or 5%, primarily due to lower demand, as detailed by segment below. Operating Income Margin 2002 2001 Life and Laboratory Sciences 14.4% 8.6% Measurement and Control 7.2% 2.2% Optical Technologies (12.0%) (13.4%) Consolidated 7.5% 1.6% Operating income was $155.5 million in 2002, compared with $34.2 million in 2001. Operating income margin increased to 7.5% in 2002 from 1.6% in 2001. Operating income in 2002 was reduced by additional charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during the fourth quarter of 2001, other restructuring actions initiated in 2002, and certain other costs, net (Note 15). Operating income in 2001 was reduced by charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during 2001 and certain other costs, net. The restructuring and other items totaled $61.3 million and $158.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are discussed by segment below and in more detail in Note 15. The 2001 period also included $40.2 million of goodwill amortization. Amortization of goodwill ceased following the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective in 2002 (Note 1). Operating income increased primarily due to lower restructuring and other costs, net, in 2002, the amortization of goodwill in 2001, and a lower cost base following recent restructuring actions offset by lower revenues and the resulting reduced profitability at a number of businesses, discussed below. Among the factors contributing to a lower cost base was lower spending for selling, general, and administrative expenses, which decreased 9% to $564.7 million in 2002, primarily due to cost reduction measures including facility consolidations. In addition, spending on research and development activities declined 10% to $155.1 million in 2002, as the company focused its spending on those projects with the highest estimated returns.  In response to a continued downturn in semiconductor and other industrial markets served by the company, and in an effort to further integrate business units and reduce the number of real estate locations, the company continued restructuring initiatives in 2002 at a number of business units. The restructuring and related actions primarily consisted of headcount reductions, writedowns of production equipment and abandonment of leases for telecommunications products, and consolidation of facilities to streamline operations and reduce costs. These actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in late 2002 and continuing in early 2003 of approximately $43 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment, $13 million in the Measurement and Control segment, and $23 million in the Optical Technologies segment. Life and Laboratory Sciences 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $1,204,232 $1,173,032 2.7% Operating Income Margin 14.4% 8.6% 5.8% Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $31.2 million to $1.204 billion in 2002. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $23.1 million in 2002. Sales increased $2.6 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenues grew nominally, increasing $5.5 million, or 0.5%. Increased demand for high end technology mass spectrometry equipment and histology and cytology products was offset in part by weakened demand for spectroscopy instruments and sample preparation products that had mid single digit percentage declines in sales, primarily due to lower capital spending. The company believes that many pharmaceutical customers, for example, were delaying purchases except for high end equipment where recent technological advances may provide a competitive advantage. Operating income margin increased to 14.4% in 2002 from 8.6% in 2001. Operating income margin was affected by goodwill amortization of $26.3 million in 2001. Goodwill amortization was discontinued in 2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Operating income margin was also affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million and $47.9 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from lower restructuring and other costs, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in 2002, cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002 and, to a lesser extent, revenue growth of higher margin products. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million, including $12.2 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention at businesses being consolidated. The segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $1.3 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. In addition, the segment realized a net loss of $4.3 million on the sale of assets, principally its Dynex automated diagnostics product line, and wrote down $1.4 million of fixed assets at abandoned facilities. In 2001, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $47.9 million, including cash costs of $29.9 million, primarily for severance and abandoned facilities; $8.0 million of asset writedowns; $6.9 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines; a charge of $3.4 million for the writeoff of in process research and development at an acquired business; $0.7 million of noncash severance costs; and $1.0 million of gains on the sale of a small business unit and a product line (Note 15).  Measurement and Control 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $636,025 $705,093 (9.8%) Operating Income Margin 7.2% 2.2% 5.0% Sales in the Measurement and Control segment decreased $69.1 million, or 10%, to $636.0 million in 2002. Sales decreased $29.4 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $8.3 million in 2002. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from divestitures, acquisitions, and currency translation, revenues decreased $48.0 million, or 7%, primarily due to weaker demand. The decrease was due to a decline in revenues in each of the segments principal businesses, particularly the control technologies business, where over half of the decrease occurred. The weaker demand was primarily due to economic conditions facing customers, particularly in the semiconductor, energy, and steel industries. The decrease in revenues was offset in part by a $26.8 million sale of explosives detection equipment in the fourth quarter of 2002 following a congressional mandate to begin screening all checked airline baggage in the United States by the end of 2002. The principal divestitures by the segment included the July 2002 sale of Thermo BLH and Thermo Nobel, which manufacture and sell strain gauges, and were placed for sale in 2001 (Note 2); the August 2001 sale of its Pharos Marine unit, which manufactures and sells marine navigation equipment; the April 2001 sale of the CAC and Mid South businesses, which provide the oil and gas industry with wellhead safety and control products; and the July 2001 sale of its ThermoMicroscopes unit, a manufacturer of scanning probe microscopes. The principal acquisition by the segment was the July 2002 purchase of the radiation monitoring products business of Saint Gobain Corporation (Note 2). Operating income margin increased to 7.2% in 2002 from 2.2% in 2001. Operating income margin was affected by goodwill amortization of $11.9 million in 2001. Goodwill amortization was discontinued in 2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Operating income was also affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $13.6 million and $46.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from lower restructuring and other costs, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in 2002, and the effects of cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002, offset in part by the decrease in revenues. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other charges, net, of $13.6 million, including $20.4 million of cash costs, principally for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention. In addition, the segment recorded $8.7 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of businesses, principally its Thermo BLH and Thermo Nobel subsidiaries. In 2002, the segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of $1.4 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $0.5 million of asset writedowns. In 2001, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $46.0 million including $21.2 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and other exit costs; $12.0 million, net, for the loss on sale of businesses or writedowns of businesses subsequently sold; $9.2 million of charges to cost of revenues, principally for discontinued product lines; $3.5 million of asset writedowns; $1.0 million for impairment of a note receivable; and $0.2 million of other costs. These charges were offset in part by a gain of $1.1 million on the sale of a building (Note 15).  Optical Technologies 2002 2001 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $258,640 $323,888 (20.1%) Operating Income Margin (12.0%) (13.4%) 1.4% Sales in the Optical Technologies segment decreased $65.2 million, or 20%, to $258.6 million in 2002. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $2.7 million in 2002. Sales decreased $2.5 million due to divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and divestitures, revenues decreased $60.0 million, or 19%, primarily due to weaker demand. The weaker demand was due to a severe slowdown in the semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely affected all of the segments principal businesses. In the third quarter of 2002, following the companys acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Spectra Physics, the company conformed this divisions backlog policy to the prevailing practice at the companys other businesses of including in backlog only product orders that are expected to ship within six months. Spectra Physics historical practice had been to include orders expected to ship within 12 months. This change resulted in a reduction of backlog of $39.3 million. Excluding the effect of this change, the segments backlog decreased 40% during 2002, and totaled $55.8 million as of December 28, 2002. Operating income margin was negative 12.0% in 2002, compared with negative 13.4% in 2001. Operating income margin was affected by goodwill amortization of $2.0 million in 2001. Goodwill amortization was discontinued in 2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Operating income was also affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $25.9 million and $53.3 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from lower restructuring and other costs, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in 2002, and the effect of cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in 2001 and 2002, offset in part by lower revenues at each of the segments principal businesses, particularly the lasers business. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other charges, net, of $25.9 million, including $9.7 million of cash costs, principally for severance and abandoned equipment leases associated with suspended telecom initiatives. The cash costs also included $0.7 million for the settlement of litigation. In addition, this segment wrote off assets totaling $8.8 million, primarily for abandoned telecommunication and other manufacturing equipment. The segment also recorded a charge of $0.8 million resulting from employee options to purchase shares of Spectra Physics becoming options to purchase shares of Thermo Electron following the acquisition of the minority interest in this business in February 2002 (Note 16). In 2002, the segment also recorded $6.5 million of charges to cost of revenues for two discontinued product lines, and a charge of $0.1 million for the loss on sale of a small business unit. In 2001, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $53.3 million including $24.2 million of asset writedowns, principally fixed assets associated with telecommunication initiatives; $19.1 million of cash costs for severance, lease obligations for abandoned equipment and facilities, litigation loss, and other exit costs; $9.9 million of charges to cost of revenues for inventory writedowns; and a charge of $0.1 million, net, for the sale of a small business unit and a facility (Note 15). Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $131.0 million and $38.2 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $47.9 million in 2002 from $68.5 million in 2001, primarily due to lower invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of company securities, acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense decreased to $40.9 million in 2002 from $71.8 million in 2001 as a result of the redemption, maturity, and repurchase of debentures, as well as entering into interest rate swap arrangements, offset in part by interest on borrowings under securities lending arrangements (Note 10).  During 2002 and 2001, the company had gains on investments, net, of $123.1 million and $35.6 million, respectively. The gains included $111.4 million and $35.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, from the sale of shares of FLIR. Of the total gain from the sale of FLIR shares, $31.0 million and $14.2 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, represent a recovery of amounts written down in prior years. Gains on investments in 2001 were reduced by a charge of $2.8 million to write down two available for sale securities due to impairment that the company deemed other than temporary. The company recorded income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $2.5 million in 2002 and $4.7 million in 2001, primarily related to the investment in FLIR through the first quarter of 2002. In 2001, other income, net, included $0.5 million of other expense, principally currency losses. In addition, the company repurchased and redeemed debentures, resulting in a charge of $1.5 million in 2002 and a gain of $1.7 million in 2001. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 32.3% and 38.1% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2002, primarily due to the absence of nondeductible goodwill amortization following the adoption of SFAS No. 142 and, to a lesser extent, a reorganization of the companys subsidiaries in several European countries that resulted in a more tax efficient corporate structure. The effective tax rate exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate in 2001 due to the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible expenses, which included goodwill amortization. Minority Interest Income Minority interest income of $0.3 million and $5.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, represents minority shareholders allocable share of losses at Spectra Physics through the date on which the company acquired the minority interest in this subsidiary in February 2002 (Note 16). Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was $194.4 million in 2002, compared with $50.7 million in 2001. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of FLIR shares, and other items, discussed above. Results were also affected by the absence of goodwill in 2002. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle The company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, in the first quarter of 2001, and recorded an after tax charge of $1.0 million representing the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle. Discontinued Operations During 2002, primarily as a result of new tax regulations concerning deductible losses from divested businesses, the company revised its estimate of the tax consequences of business disposals in discontinued operations and recorded a tax benefit of $46.6 million. In addition, in 2002 the company sold its Trophy Radiologie business for approximately $51 million in cash and, principally as a result of this transaction, recorded an after tax gain of $17.4 million. Also, the company sold the last remaining component of its former power generation business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition totaling $13.0 million, primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that were realized upon the sale. In February 2001, the company sold its interest in Thermo Cardiosystems to Thoratec in exchange for 19.3 million shares of Thoratec common stock. Certain restrictions, which lapsed in August 2002, limited the timing of the companys ability to sell these shares. The company recorded an after tax charge of $66.0 million in the first quarter of 2001 for a decline in market value of Thoratec common stock as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations.  Following a sale of shares in February 2002 for net proceeds of $104 million and an after tax gain of $38.4 million, the company owned less than 20% of Thoratecs outstanding shares and began accounting for its investment as an available for sale security in continuing operations in the first quarter of 2002, with unrealized gains or losses recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying balance sheet (Note 16). In 2001, the company sold a substantial portion of its discontinued power generation business for net proceeds of $249 million and realized an after tax gain of $15.6 million on the disposition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $710.5 million at December 31, 2003, compared with $667.8 million at December 28, 2002. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents, and short term available for sale investments of $418.2 million at December 31, 2003, compared with $875.5 million at December 28, 2002. This decrease was due to cash of $665.6 million used in financing activities, offset in part by cash provided by operating and investing activities, as discussed below. 2003 Cash provided by operating activities was $216.7 million during 2003, including $223.4 million provided by continuing operations and $6.7 million used by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs, and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $38.5 million, net of taxes, in 2003. Decreases in inventories and accounts receivable of $28.3 million and $18.1 million, respectively, resulted from continuing efforts to improve working capital. The use of cash of $6.7 million for discontinued operations was principally due to the payment of liabilities, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $25.2 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2003. The company expects to pay approximately $10.5 million of this amount for severance, employee retention, and other costs primarily through 2004. The balance of $14.7 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 82% to be paid through 2005 and the remainder through 2016. In addition, at December 31, 2003, the company had accrued $15.8 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $5.3 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through 2004. The balance primarily represents abandoned facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014. During 2003, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, and collection of a note receivable. The company expended $134.9 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions (Note 2). The company expended $39.5 million for purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of dispositions. In April and June 2003, the company received aggregate cash payments of $75.6 million, including $69.1 million of principal payments, plus interest, from Trimble Navigation Limited as complete and early payment of Trimbles note to the company (Note 2). The companys financing activities used $665.6 million of cash during 2003, including $661.9 million for continuing operations. During 2003, the companys continuing operations expended $377.0 million to reduce short term notes payable. The company received net proceeds of $75.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options. During 2003, the company expended $268.1 million to redeem its debt securities (Note 10). In addition, the company expended $88.9 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, of which $57.8 million was used to repurchase 3.0 million shares of the companys common stock. As of March 1, 2004, the company had approximately $100.0 million remaining under Board of Directors authorizations to repurchase its own securities through February 25, 2005. The debt repurchases and redemptions have been made with the objective of reducing interest costs.  2002 Cash provided by operating activities was $110.3 million during 2002, including $119.8 million provided by continuing operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs, and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $44.2 million, net of taxes, in 2002. Aside from cash used for restructuring actions, a decrease in other current liabilities used cash of $64.2 million, including $44.8 million of income tax payments and $10.8 million of accrued interest, principally due to the debt redemptions discussed in Note 10. The income tax payments included approximately $39.0 million related to gains on investments. The use of cash of $9.5 million from discontinued operations was principally due to the payment of liabilities, primarily for the settlement of litigation, including a patent infringement matter (Note 11), offset in part by cash from tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. During 2002, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included the sale of other investments, acquisitions and divestitures, the collection of notes receivable, the purchase of shares of a majority owned subsidiary, and the purchase of property, plant, and equipment. The companys continuing operations received proceeds of $65.5 million from the sale of other investments, principally shares of FLIR (Note 4), and proceeds of $23.6 million from the sale of businesses, net of cash divested (Note 2). In addition, the companys continuing operations expended $78.7 million for acquisitions (Note 2), $23.2 million to purchase the remaining minority owned shares of its Spectra Physics subsidiary (Note 16), and $40.2 million for purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of dispositions. The companys continuing operations collected $76.4 million from notes receivable, which included the repayment of Viasys Healthcares $33.4 million principal amount note in May 2002, the August 2002 repayment of a $25.0 million principal amount note receivable related to the sale of a business in 2000, and partial repayment from Trimble Navigation Limited in March 2002 (Note 2). During 2002, investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $151.0 million of cash, primarily representing proceeds of $104 million from the sale of Thoratec common stock and the sale of Trophy Radiologie (Note 16). The companys financing activities used $593.0 million of cash during 2002, including $592.7 million for continuing operations. During 2002, the companys continuing operations expended $590.7 million to redeem certain convertible debentures. The company increased short term notes payable by $311.1 million to partially fund debt redemptions (Note 10). The companys continuing operations received net proceeds of $25.3 million from the exercise of employee stock options. During 2002, the company expended $334.2 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, of which $285.6 million was expended to repurchase 15.4 million shares of the companys common stock. In December 2002, the company entered into arrangements under which the company may borrow up to $250 million for working capital needs and possible acquisitions (Note 10). 2001 Cash provided by operating activities was $190.4 million in 2001, including $186.4 million from continuing operations. Accounts receivable used $19.0 million of cash, principally as a result of strong fourth quarter revenue growth in 2001 over the fourth quarter of 2000 at the companys Life and Laboratory Sciences segment. Accounts payable decreased $19.1 million, primarily due to a lower volume of purchasing activities resulting from slowdowns in several businesses. Other current liabilities increased by $52.5 million, including $39.7 million of restructuring reserves and $10.2 million of accrued interest, due to the timing of payments. During 2001, the companys investing activities expended $73.2 million, net of dispositions, for purchases of property, plant, and equipment; $69.5 million for the purchase of shares of a majority owned subsidiary; and $14.1 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions. In addition, the company recorded proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash divested, of $46.8 million, and $43.3 million for the sale of other investments, principally shares of FLIR.  The companys financing activities used $696.3 million of cash during 2001, including $503.0 million for continuing operations. The companys continuing operations expended $43.1 million for the repayment of long term obligations and received net proceeds of $69.9 million from the exercise of employee stock options. In addition, the company expended $511.4 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities in 2001. During 2001, the companys discontinued operations used $193.3 million of cash, including cash at the companys Kadant subsidiary, which was spun off in August 2001, and for the repayment of debt. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company does not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements except for letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds, and other guarantees, $24.5 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold (Note 11). The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003, which are principally for its continuing operations. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment 2005 and 2007 and 2009 and 2004 2006 2008 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Long term debt obligations $ 4,676 $ 1,371 $215,383 $ 3,370 $224,800 Capital lease obligations 1,205 2,069 2,099 5,217 10,590 Operating lease obligations 37,793 54,241 30,964 87,758 210,756 Purchase obligations 67,022 1,877 8 68,907 Total contractual obligations 110,696 59,558 248,454 96,345 515,053 Other Commitments: Letters of credit and bank guarantees 38,110 6,885 563 232 45,790 Surety bonds and other guarantees 18,032 742 65 6,479 25,318 Total other commitments 56,142 7,627 628 6,711 71,108 $166,838 $ 67,185 $249,082 $103,056 $586,161 This table excludes $80.3 million of other long term liabilities, principally pension liabilities, and $11.6 million of deferred income taxes, as these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment schedules. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant, and equipment but expects that for 2004, such expenditures will approximate $55 to $65 million. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.  Forward looking Statements In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers that the following important factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual results in 2004 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us. We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change, and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions, and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services, and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test, and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels. These activities require us to make significant investments. Products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can. The products that we are currently developing, or those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete. We sell our products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries, which would adversely affect our results of operations when those industries experience a downturn. The growth and profitability of some of our businesses depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns. For example, our Optical Technologies segment depends in part on sales to the semiconductor industry, and our Measurement and Control segment depends in part on sales to the steel and cement industries. Slowdowns in these industries would adversely affect sales by these segments, which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our business is impacted by general worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Adverse economic conditions worldwide could adversely impact our business in 2004 and beyond, resulting in: reduced demand for some of our products; increased rate of order cancellations or delays; increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories; increased pressure on the prices for our products and services; and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable.  Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local, and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure, and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include manufacturers of semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold. From 1997 through 2003, we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of $2 billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such as lawsuits, product liability claims, and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however, we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. Our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives. In addition to the real estate consolidations and cost saving initiatives that we have pursued over the past three years, we are instituting practical process improvement (PPI) programs at our locations to further enhance our productivity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. While we anticipate continued benefits from these PPI initiatives as well as our continuing sourcing activities, future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve. Our new branding strategy could be unsuccessful. We historically operated our business largely as autonomous, unaffiliated companies, and as a result, each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names. Our new marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple, unrelated brands to two brands, Thermo Electron and Spectra Physics. Several of our former brands such as Finnigan, Nicolet, and Oriel commanded strong market recognition and customer loyalty. We believe the transition to the two new brands enhances and strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company. Our success in promoting our brands depends on many factors, including effective communication of the transition to our customers, acceptance and recognition by customers of these new brands, and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams. If we are not successful with this strategy, we may experience erosion in our product recognition, brand image and customer loyalty, and a decrease in demand for our products. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: finding new markets for our products; developing new applications for our technologies; combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; continuing key customer initiatives; strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; and continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business. As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In 2003, our international revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues from the United States, accounted for approximately  56% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the "functional currency"). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. In addition, reported sales made in non U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $120.8 million and $28.7 million, respectively, while in fiscal 2001, the unfavorable effects of currency translation decreased revenues of our continuing operations by $46.5 million. Our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we previously acquired several companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet, which amounts to approximately $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2003. We assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the companys currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The companys forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen, and Swiss francs. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements.  Interest Rates Certain of the companys short term available for sale investments and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2003 and 2002 market interest rates would result in a negative impact to the company of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments. A 100 basis point increase in 90 day LIBOR at December 31, 2003, and December 28, 2002, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by $1 million and $4 million, respectively. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as long term. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling, and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2003 and 2002 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $89 million and $76 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year end 2003 and 2002 currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $2.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2003 and 2002 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of $2.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2003 and 2002 market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of $10 million and $9 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments, principally its available for sale investments.
