Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F 1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. During 2000 and 2001, the company carried out the principal aspects of a major reorganization plan under which it sold or spun off many noncore businesses. In 2004, the company sold Spectra Physics, its optical technologies segment. As a result of these actions, the companys continuing operations are comprised solely of its instrument businesses. The businesses that have been spun off and sold have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. The companys continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Life and Laboratory Sciences and Measurement and Control. Revenues 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Life and Laboratory Sciences $1,573,445 71.3% $1,293,009 68.1% Measurement and Control 632,550 28.7% 601,104 31.6% Other 5,265 0.3% $2,205,995 100% $1,899,378 100% The companys revenues grew by 16% during 2004. The strengthening of non U.S. currencies relative to the dollar caused an increase in reported revenues as did acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the change in revenues caused by currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, which are discussed below, sales increased 4% in 2004, primarily due to increased demand. The higher demand resulted primarily from a recovery in the U.S. and Asian economies that has positively affected capital spending across many markets addressed by the company together with growth from new product introductions. The companys strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2004 and 2003. The principal acquisitions included InnaPhase Corporation, a supplier of laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets, which was acquired in September 2004; US Counseling Services, Inc. (USCS), a supplier of equipment asset management services to the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and related industries, which was acquired in April 2004; Jouan SA, a global supplier of products used to prepare and preserve laboratory samples, which was acquired in December 2003; Laboratory Management Systems, Inc. (LMSi), a supplier of regulatory instrument and consulting services to the pharmaceutical and related industries, which was acquired in November 2003; and the personal radiation detection instruments product line from Siemens plc, which was acquired in October 2003.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION In 2004, the companys operating income and operating income margin improved to $237.5 million and 10.8%, respectively, from $187.4 million and 9.9%, respectively, in 2003. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The improvement resulted primarily from lower restructuring costs, net, in 2004 and a lower cost base following restructuring actions in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues, offset in part by $13.8 million of higher amortization expense associated with acquisition related intangible assets. Restructuring and other costs, net, (including charges to cost of revenues associated with the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and facility consolidations) reduced operating income by $19.2 million and $45.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The companys effective tax rate was 15.8% and 21.3% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2004 includes a benefit of $33.8 million associated with the settlement of tax audits. The effective tax rate in 2003 includes a tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance for tax credit carryforwards of $9.0 million and a tax benefit of $3.7 million from the sale of a business. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2005 for its existing business will be approximately 29%. Income from continuing operations increased to $218.4 million in 2004, from $175.2 million in 2003, primarily due to the higher operating income discussed above, offset in part by lower gains from the sale of investments. During 2004, the companys cash flow from operations totaled $264.5 million, compared with $214.7 million in 2003. The increase resulted primarily from higher income offset in part by increased investment in working capital in 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the companys outstanding debt totaled $241.1 million, of which 93% is due in 2007 and thereafter. The company expects to borrow up to $600 million in 2005 through a 364 day bridge financing commitment obtained in connection with the January 2005 agreement to acquire Kendro Laboratory Products for $833.5 million, subject to a post closing adjustment. The commitment is subject to customary conditions for financings of this type. The company expects that its existing cash and short term investments of $512.3 million as of December 31, 2004, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to $250 million under its existing 5 year revolving credit agreement and commitment for funds to acquire Kendro, are sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, restructuring, and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $22.8 million at December 31, 2004. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer, and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION (b) The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand, and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) The company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Goodwill totaled $1.51 billion at December 31, 2004. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels, and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary. (d) The company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those established at the dates of acquisition. (e) The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $594.0 million at December 31, 2004, including $261.0 million of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (f) In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. (g) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. (h) The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or "elements." The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION (i) At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $27.4 million at December 31, 2004. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (j) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $66.2 million at December 31, 2004. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. (k) The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $22.8 million at December 31, 2004. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (l) The company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation for which a loss is probable and provides a reserve for losses that can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those reserves may be required. (m) One of the companys U.S. subsidiaries and several non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for defined benefit plans totaled $9.5 million in 2004. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs. (n) The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income. The companys accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $9.8 million at December 31, 2004. Should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (o) The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. (p) The company considers declines in quoted fair market values of available for sale investments and other equity investments with durations of six to nine months as indicative that the decline may be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2004, the company held 3,220,000 shares of Newport Corporation common stock, which it received as partial consideration in the July 2004 sale of Spectra Physics. The cost and quoted fair market value of the shares at December 31, 2004, were $45.0 million and $45.4 million, respectively. Should a decline in quoted fair market value occur, an impairment charge may be required.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Results of Operations 2004 Compared With 2003 Continuing Operations Sales in 2004 were $2.206 billion, an increase of $306.6 million from 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $92.1 million in 2004. Sales increased $134.4 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenues increased $80.1 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased demand, as described by segment below. Operating Income Margin 2004 2003 Life and Laboratory Sciences 14.3% 14.2% Measurement and Control 8.4% 7.4% Consolidated 10.8% 9.9% Operating income was $237.5 million in 2004, compared with $187.4 million in 2003. Operating income margin increased to 10.8% in 2004 from 9.9% in 2003. Operating income increased primarily due to lower restructuring and other costs, net, and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues in each segment in 2004. Operating income in 2004 and 2003 was reduced by additional charges associated with restructuring actions initiated in those and prior years and certain other costs, net (Note 15). The restructuring and other items totaled $19.2 million and $45.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are discussed by segment below. Restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, in 2004 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies in response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the companys overall reorganization, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. The actions initiated in 2004 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $10 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $3 million in the Measurement and Control segment. The company expects to incur an additional $1 million of restructuring costs, primarily in 2005, for charges associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until incurred. In connection with the planned acquisition of Kendro, the company expects to undertake restructuring actions at both acquired and existing facilities. The actions at acquired facilities will be recorded as a cost of the acquisition. The actions at existing facilities will be charged to expense. The company has not finalized its plans for integrating Kendro with its existing business but expects that charges to expense will total $10 $20 million following the acquisition. Life and Laboratory Sciences 2004 2003 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $1,573,445 $1,293,009 21.7% Operating Income Margin 14.3% 14.2% 0.1% Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $280.4 million, or 22%, to $1.573 billion in 2004. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $66.7 million in 2004. Sales increased $153.1 million due to the acquisitions of InnaPhase in September 2004, USCS in April 2004, Jouan in December 2003, and LMSi in November 2003, net of product line divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenues increased $60.6 million, or 5%, due to higher demand. The increase in demand resulted principally in higher sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION and, to a lesser extent, new anatomical pathology products and laboratory informatics. The combination of new products and a rebound in sales to industrial markets along with continued strength in pharmaceutical demand have driven the instrument sales growth, offset in part by lower revenues in Europe where the recovery of demand has lagged the U.S. and Asia. The increase in revenues was offset in part by $5.6 million of lower revenue from rapid diagnostic tests due to a weak flu season in 2004 following a harsh season in 2003. Operating income margin was 14.3% in 2004 and 14.2% in 2003. Operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $10.2 million and $21.8 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as discussed below. The favorable impact of lower restructuring and other costs, net, and higher revenues was substantially offset by a $13.2 million increase in amortization expense of acquisition related intangible assets and the inclusion of Jouan, USCS, and LMSi, which have historically operated at lower profitability margins compared with the segments existing businesses. In 2004, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $10.2 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $3.2 million, consisting of $2.1 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan, and $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The segment incurred $8.6 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded a gain of $2.6 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1.0 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings. In 2003, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $21.8 million, including $18.8 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention, and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded net charges of $3.4 million to write down the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily buildings held for sale, to expected disposal value, offset by $0.4 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of a product line (Note 15). Measurement and Control 2004 2003 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $632,550 $601,104 5.2% Operating Income Margin 8.4% 7.4% 1.0% Sales in the Measurement and Control segment increased $31.4 million, or 5%, to $632.6 million in 2004. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $25.4 million in 2004. Sales decreased $13.5 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. The principal divestiture was the segments test and measurement business, which it sold in October 2003. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenues increased $19.5 million, or 3%. The increase was primarily the result of a rebound in demand for precision temperature control products from the semiconductor industry and other process applications and, to a lesser extent, process instruments used by the materials industry and equipment used in metal production, particularly in China. Operating income margin increased to 8.4% in 2004 from 7.4% in 2003. Operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $6.5 million and $10.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as discussed below. Nearly half of the increase in operating income margin resulted from the $3.8 million reduction in restructuring and other costs, net, with the balance from higher sales volumes and cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. In 2004, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $6.5 million, including cash costs of $6.2 million, principally for severance, abandoned facilities, and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded charges of $0.1 million for the writedown of equipment at an abandoned facility, and charges to cost of revenues of $0.2 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION In 2003, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $10.3 million, including cash costs of $10.3 million, principally for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention, and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded charges of $2.0 million, primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to reduce the carrying value to disposal value, and for the writedown of assets at facilities being consolidated, offset by a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of a building. The segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $0.1 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (Note 15). Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $21.7 million and $35.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively (Note 4). Other income, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, and other items, net. Interest income decreased to $9.0 million in 2004 from $19.7 million in 2003, primarily due to lower invested cash balances following the acquisitions (net of divestitures) in late 2003 and 2004 and the use of cash for the repurchase and redemption of company securities. Interest expense decreased to $11.0 million in 2004 from $18.2 million in 2003, as a result of the repurchase and redemption of debentures. During 2004 and 2003, the company had gains on investments, net, of $20.8 million and $35.5 million, respectively. The gains included $9.6 million in 2004 and $16.3 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and $13.7 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of FLIR Systems, Inc. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained an equity interest in FLIR as part of the acquisition of Spectra Physics AB in 1999. Other income in 2004 and 2003 also includes currency transaction gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In addition, the company repurchased and redeemed debentures, resulting in a charge of $1.0 million during 2003. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 15.8% and 21.3% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2004 primarily due to $33.8 million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The companys tax returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the period 1998 to 2000. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits were realizable. In addition, audits of state tax returns were also completed in 2004. The 2003 effective tax rate was favorably affected by $9.0 million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards (Note 6) and $3.7 million of tax benefit from the sale of a business. These tax benefits reduced the companys 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates by 13.0 percentage points and 5.7 percentage points, respectively. The 2003 effective tax rate was also favorably affected by the full year impact of a reorganization throughout 2002 of the companys subsidiaries in several European countries that resulted in a more tax efficient corporate structure and a decrease in 2003 of gains from the sale of investment securities. In addition, the company reduced its effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points in 2003 through repatriation of cash from non U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in foreign tax credits. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2005 for its existing business will be approximately 29%. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, signed into law in October 2004, allows companies to repatriate permanently reinvested non U.S. earnings in 2005 or 2006 at an effective rate of 5.25%. The company does not currently expect to take advantage of this provision. The new tax law also phases out an existing deduction based on export revenues and replaces it with a deduction for a portion of the profit derived from domestic manufacturing activities. The company is continuing to evaluate the effect of this change but does not expect a material impact on its tax provision.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Contingent Liabilities At year end 2004, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in either of the two pending matters described in Note 11 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $218.4 million in 2004, compared with $175.2 million in 2003. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of Thoratec shares, and other items, discussed above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) "Share Based Payment." SFAS No. 123(R) amends SFAS No. 123 to require that companies record as expense the effect of equity based compensation, including stock options over the applicable vesting period. The company currently discloses the effect on income that stock options would have were they recorded as expense. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required under current standards. The new rule applies to option grants made after adoption as well as options that are not vested at the date of adoption. SFAS No. 123(R) becomes effective no later than fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The company does not currently expect to elect early adoption and has not determined whether it will apply the new standard prospectively in the third quarter of 2005, retroactively from the beginning of 2005, or restate all periods on a comparable basis. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4," which is the result of its efforts to converge U.S. accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards. SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) to be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during 2006. The company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements. Discontinued Operations The company had after tax gains of $100.5 million in 2004 and $27.3 million in 2003 from the disposal of discontinued operations. In June 2004, the company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its Optical Technologies segment, Spectra Physics, to Newport Corporation. On July 16, 2004, the company completed the sale. The company has reclassified the results of Spectra Physics as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. The companys discontinued operations (Spectra Physics) had revenues through the date of sale of $118.9 million and $197.8 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2.2 million. The companys discontinued operations incurred a net loss in 2003 of $2.5 million, net of a tax benefit of $1.5 million. The improvement resulted from a rebound in the demand for lasers and photonics from microelectronics customers and other industrial markets served by Spectra Physics. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In 2004, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra Physics of $45.9 million, net of a tax provision of $15.9 million.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION The tax returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses totaling $52.7 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded as a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations in 2004. In addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of after tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. The 2003 gain consists of two pre tax components and two tax components. In 2003, the company resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained following the sale of businesses in its discontinued operations. In connection with the resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages estimated and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease obligations, the companys pre tax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of the related businesses increased by $27.1 million. In 2003, the company also sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations, Peter Brotherhood Ltd., and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior to 2003, including post closing purchase price adjustments. The company recorded pre tax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of $8.3 million, substantially as a result of these transactions. The company recorded a tax provision of $13.2 million on the above gains and realized $5.1 million of additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003, principally foreign tax credits. 2003 Compared With 2002 Continuing Operations Sales in 2003 were $1.899 billion, an increase of $50.0 million from 2002. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $116.8 million in 2003. Sales decreased $9.1 million due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, divestitures, and acquisitions, revenues decreased $57.7 million, or 3%, primarily due to lower demand, as described by segment below. Operating Income Margin 2003 2002 Life and Laboratory Sciences 14.2% 14.4% Measurement and Control 7.4% 7.3% Consolidated 9.9% 9.2% Operating income was $187.4 million in 2003, compared with $169.9 million in 2002. Operating income margin increased to 9.9% in 2003 from 9.2% in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was reduced by additional charges associated with restructuring actions initiated in 2003, restructuring plans initiated prior to 2003, and certain other costs, net (Note 15). Operating income in 2002 was reduced by charges associated with restructuring plans initiated during 2002 and 2001, and certain other costs, net. The restructuring and other items totaled $45.3 million and $46.2 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are discussed by segment below. Operating income increased primarily due to a lower cost base following recent restructuring actions. Among the other actions contributing to a lower cost base was lower spending on research and development activities, which decreased 3% to $128.0 million in 2003 as the company focused on those projects with the highest estimated returns. In response to a continued downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the companys overall reorganization, restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. These actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in mid to late 2003 and continuing in early 2004 of approximately $11 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $4 million in the Measurement and Control segment.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00 21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The company began applying the consensus prospectively in the first quarter of 2003. Under EITF Issue No. 00 21, the company recognizes revenue and related costs for arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables, such as equipment and installation, as each element is delivered or completed based on its fair value. When a portion of the customers payment is not due until installation, the company defers that portion of the revenue until completion of installation. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 00 21 did not materially affect the companys financial statements. Life and Laboratory Sciences 2003 2002 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $1,293,009 $1,204,034 7.4% Operating Income Margin 14.2% 14.4% (0.2%) Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $89.0 million, or 7%, to $1.293 billion in 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $86.3 million in 2003. Sales decreased $9.7 million due to product line divestitures, net of acquisitions. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, divestitures, and acquisitions, revenues increased $12.4 million, or 1%. A $13.3 million increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products was offset in part by decreased sales of bioscience instrumentation, principally due to a downturn in demand from pharmaceutical and industrial markets. The increase in sales of clinical diagnostic products resulted primarily from higher demand for rapid diagnostic tests during a harsh flu season in the United States and, to a lesser extent, increased demand for a newly released tissue processor used in anatomical pathology laboratories. Operating income margin decreased to 14.2% in 2003 from 14.4% in 2002. Operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $21.8 million and $19.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition to the increase in restructuring and other costs in 2003, the decrease in operating income margin resulted from higher marketing and selling expenses due to several key commercial initiatives. The segments commercial initiatives included key customer account management, increased advertising costs for a branding transition, and establishment of customer call centers and product demonstration facilities. These cost increases were offset in part by cost savings from facility consolidations and related productivity measures. The cost reduction measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately $14 million on an annualized basis. In 2003, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $21.8 million, including $18.8 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention, and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded net charges of $3.4 million to write down the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily buildings held for sale, to expected disposal value, offset by $0.4 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of a product line. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.4 million, including $12.3 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention at businesses being consolidated. The segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $1.3 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. In addition, the segment realized a net loss of $4.3 million on the sale of assets, principally its Dynex automated diagnostics product line, and wrote down $1.5 million of fixed assets at abandoned facilities (Note 15). Measurement and Control 2003 2002 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $601,104 $629,697 (4.5%) Operating Income Margin 7.4% 7.3% 0.1%  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Sales in the Measurement and Control segment decreased $28.6 million, or 5%, to $601.1 million in 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $30.1 million in 2003. Sales increased $3.3 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenues decreased $62.0 million, or 10%. Of this amount, $26.8 million, or 4%, was due to the inclusion in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a shipment of explosives detection equipment to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration following a congressional mandate to screen all checked airline baggage in the United States by the end of 2002. The balance of the decrease was primarily the result of weaker demand arising from economic conditions facing customers, particularly in the process instruments businesses where approximately 60% of the remaining decrease occurred. Process instruments are generally used in industrial markets such as minerals and mining and petrochemical applications, where capital expenditures slowed. In addition, a 7% decrease in sales of equipment used primarily in semiconductor applications was offset in part by higher revenues from equipment used in homeland security. Operating income margin increased to 7.4% in 2003 from 7.3% in 2002. Operating income margin was affected by restructuring and other costs, net, of $10.3 million and $13.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from cost reduction measures following restructuring actions in 2002 and 2003 and, to a lesser extent, $3.3 million of lower restructuring and other costs, net, offset in part by the effect on operating margin of lower revenues. The cost reduction measures in 2002 and 2003 reduced the segments cost base by an aggregate of approximately $17 million on an annualized basis. In 2003, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $10.3 million, including cash costs of $10.3 million, principally for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention, and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the segment recorded charges of $2.0 million, primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to reduce the carrying value to disposal value, and for the writedown of assets at facilities being consolidated, offset by a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of a building. The segment also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $0.1 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. In 2002, the segment recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $13.6 million, including $20.4 million of cash costs principally for severance, abandoned facilities, and employee retention. In addition, the segment recorded $8.7 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of its Thermo BLH and Thermo Nobel subsidiaries, which were noncore businesses held for sale since 2001. In 2002, the segment recorded charges to cost of revenues of $1.4 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $0.5 million of asset writedowns (Note 15). Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $35.2 million and $131.5 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $19.7 million in 2003 from $47.6 million in 2002, primarily due to lower invested cash balances following the repurchase and redemption of company securities, the payment of short term notes payable and, to a lesser extent, lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense decreased to $18.2 million in 2003 from $40.2 million in 2002 as a result of the redemption, maturity, and repurchase of debentures, as well as the full year effect of entering into interest rate swap arrangements in the first quarter of 2002, offset in part by interest on borrowings under securities lending arrangements. During 2003 and 2002, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35.5 million and $123.1 million, respectively. The gains included $16.3 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and $13.7 million and $111.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, from the sale of shares of FLIR. The company recorded income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries of $2.5 million in 2002, primarily related to the investment in FLIR. Effective March 30, 2002, following a reduction in the companys percentage ownership of FLIR to less then 20%, the company no longer reported its pro rata share of FLIR earnings but instead accounted for its remaining investment as an available for sale security (Note 4). In addition, the company repurchased and redeemed debentures, resulting in charges of $1.0 million and $1.5 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 21.3% and 32.5% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2003 primarily due to $9.0 million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards (Note 6) and $3.7 million of tax benefit from the sale of a business. These tax benefits reduced the companys 2003 effective tax rate by 5.7 percentage points. The decrease was also due in part to the full year impact on the 2003 effective tax rate of a reorganization throughout 2002 of the companys subsidiaries in several European countries that resulted in a more tax efficient corporate structure and a decrease in 2003 of gains from the sale of investment securities. In addition, the company reduced its effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points in 2003 through repatriation of cash from non U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in foreign tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $175.2 million in 2003, compared with $203.4 million in 2002. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of Thoratec and FLIR shares, and other items, discussed above. Discontinued Operations The companys discontinued operations (Spectra Physics) had revenues of $197.8 million and $237.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in revenues resulted principally from a severe slowdown in the semiconductor and other industrial markets. Net loss of the discontinued operations was $2.5 million and $9.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, net of tax benefits of $1.5 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The improvement was due to lower restructuring costs in 2003 and cost reduction measures. The company had after tax gains of $27.3 million in 2003 and $115.4 million in 2002 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The 2003 gain consists of two pre tax components and two tax components. In 2003, the company resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained following the sale of businesses in its discontinued operations. In connection with the resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages estimated and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease obligations, the companys pre tax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of the related businesses increased by $27.1 million. In 2003, the company also sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations, Peter Brotherhood, and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior to 2003, including post closing purchase price adjustments. The company recorded pre tax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of $8.3 million, substantially as a result of these transactions. The company recorded a tax provision of $13.2 million on the above gains and realized $5.1 million of additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003, principally foreign tax credits. During 2002, primarily as a result of new tax regulations concerning deductible losses from divested businesses, the company revised its estimate of the tax consequences of business disposals in discontinued operations and recorded a tax benefit of $46.6 million. In addition, in 2002 the company sold its Trophy Radiologie business for approximately $51 million in cash and, principally as a result of this transaction, recorded an after tax gain of $17.4 million. Also, the company sold the last remaining component of its former power generation business in 2002 and realized a gain from the disposition totaling $13.0 million, primarily for previously unrecognized tax benefits that were realized upon the sale. In February 2001, the company sold its interest in Thermo Cardiosystems to Thoratec in exchange for 19.3 million shares of Thoratec common stock. Certain restrictions, which lapsed in August 2002, limited the timing of the companys ability to sell these shares. Following a sale of shares in February 2002 for net proceeds of $104 million and an after tax gain of $38.4 million, the company owned less than 20% of Thoratecs outstanding shares and began accounting for its investment as an available for sale security in continuing operations in the first quarter of 2002, with unrealized gains or losses recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying balance sheet.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $890.9 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $710.5 million at December 31, 2003. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents, and short term available for sale investments of $512.3 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $418.2 million at December 31, 2003. This increase was due to cash provided by operating and investing activities, offset in part by cash of $183.2 million used in financing activities, as discussed below. 2004 Cash provided by operating activities was $264.5 million during 2004, including $250.0 million provided by continuing operations and $14.5 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs, and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $25.8 million in 2004. Accounts receivable increased $27.6 million due primarily to higher sales of mass spectrometry and informatics product offerings. Inventories increased $21.5 million, due in part to increased production of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments in response to higher demand for these products. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $14.5 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra Physics, offset in part by the payment of retained liabilities from businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $15.8 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2004. The company expects to pay approximately $5.8 million of this amount for severance, primarily through 2006, and $0.2 million for other costs, primarily through 2005. The balance of $9.8 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 53% to be paid through 2005 and the remainder through 2016. In addition, at December 31, 2004, the company had accrued $9.2 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $3.2 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through 2005. The remaining balance primarily represents abandoned facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014. During 2004, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions for $143.0 million, net of cash acquired (Note 2) and the expenditure of $44.5 million for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, net of dispositions. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $171.8 million of cash in 2004. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra Physics to Newport Corporation for $300 million, including $200 million of initial cash proceeds. As a result of Newport assuming non U.S. debt of Spectra Physics that had earlier been expected to be retained by the company, and as a result of the post closing adjustment process, the company refunded $25.1 million to Newport (Note 16). The companys financing activities used $183.2 million of cash during 2004, including $183.7 million used by continuing operations. During 2004, the company expended $231.5 million to repurchase 8.4 million shares of the companys common stock. As of December 31, 2004, the authorization by the companys Board of Directors to repurchase company securities had been substantially expended. The company received net proceeds of $57.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2004. During 2004, the company replaced its existing credit facilities with a 5 year $250 million revolving credit agreement (Note 10). 2003 Cash provided by operating activities was $214.7 million during 2003, including $200.3 million provided by continuing operations and $14.4 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs, and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $53.6 million in 2003. A decrease in inventories of $27.4 million resulted from efforts to improve working capital. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $14.4 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra Physics, offset in part by the payment of liabilities for businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION During 2003, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, and collection of a note receivable. The company expended $134.9 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions (Note 2). The company expended $37.4 million for purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of dispositions. In April and June 2003, the company received aggregate cash payments of $75.6 million, including $69.1 million of principal payments, plus interest, from Trimble Navigation Limited as complete and early payment of Trimbles note to the company. The companys financing activities used $663.6 million of cash during 2003, including $652.0 million for continuing operations. During 2003, the companys continuing operations expended $369.1 million to reduce short term notes payable. The company received net proceeds of $75.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options in 2003. During 2003, the company expended $269.1 million to redeem its debt securities (Note 10). In addition, the company expended $88.9 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, of which $57.8 million was used to repurchase 3.0 million shares of the companys common stock. The debt repurchases and redemptions have been made with the objective of reducing interest costs. 2002 Cash provided by operating activities was $106.8 million during 2002, including $114.5 million provided by continuing operations and $7.7 million used by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs, and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $53.9 million in 2002. Aside from cash used for restructuring actions, a decrease in other current liabilities used cash of $68.6 million, including $45.6 million of income taxes and $10.8 million of accrued interest, principally due to the debt redemptions discussed in Note 10. The income tax payments included approximately $39.0 million related to gains on investments. The use of cash of $7.7 million by discontinued operations was principally due to the payment of liabilities, primarily for the settlement of litigation, including a patent infringement matter (Note 11), offset in part by the positive cash flow of Spectra Physics and cash from tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. During 2002, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included the sale of other investments, acquisitions and divestitures, the collection of notes receivable, and the purchase of property, plant, and equipment. The companys continuing operations received proceeds of $65.3 million from the sale of other investments, principally shares of FLIR (Note 4), and proceeds of $22.3 million from the sale of businesses, net of cash divested (Note 2). In addition, the companys continuing operations expended $78.7 million for acquisitions (Note 2), and $31.7 million for purchases of property, plant, and equipment, net of dispositions. The companys continuing operations collected $76.4 million from notes receivable, which included the repayment of Viasys Healthcares $33.4 million principal amount note in May 2002, the August 2002 repayment of a $25.0 million principal amount note receivable related to the sale of a business in 2000, and partial repayment from Trimble Navigation Limited in March 2002. During 2002, investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $114.9 million of cash, primarily representing proceeds of $104 million from the sale of Thoratec common stock and the sale of Trophy Radiologie, offset in part by the use of $23.2 million to acquire the minority interest in Spectra Physics (Note 16). The companys financing activities used $589.5 million of cash during 2002, including $573.5 million for continuing operations. During 2002, the companys continuing operations expended $590.7 million to redeem certain convertible debentures. The company increased short term notes payable by $329.8 million to partially fund debt redemptions (Note 10). The companys continuing operations received net proceeds of $25.3 million from the exercise of employee stock options in 2002. During 2002, the company expended $334.2 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, of which $285.6 million was expended to repurchase 15.4 million shares of the companys common stock.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2002 2004 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds, and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds, and other guarantees, $24.5 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold (Note 11). The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004, which are principally for its continuing operations. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment 2006 and 2008 and 2010 and 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Long term debt obligations $ 765 $ 78,156 $135,657 $ 3,140 $217,718 Capital lease obligations 1,187 2,214 2,380 4,523 10,304 Operating lease obligations 38,048 54,043 34,075 94,294 220,460 Purchase obligations 77,889 182 78,071 Total contractual obligations 117,889 134,595 172,112 101,957 526,553 Other Commitments (not on the balance sheet): Letters of credit and bank guarantees 50,961 2,664 696 338 54,659 Surety bonds and other guarantees 13,469 126 8,227 4 21,826 Total other commitments 64,430 2,790 8,923 342 76,485 $182,319 $137,385 $181,035 $102,299 $603,038 This table excludes $91.2 million of other long term liabilities, principally pension liabilities, and $15.2 million of deferred income taxes, as these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment schedules. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant, and equipment but expects that for 2005, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $43 to $47 million. In connection with the January 2005 agreement to acquire Kendro for $833.5 million, subject to a post closing adjustment, the company obtained a bridge financing commitment which will permit it to borrow up to $600 million for a period of 364 days on terms substantially equivalent to those of its existing 5 year revolving credit agreement. The company expects to use cash from this commitment and existing cash balances to fund the acquisition of Kendro. The commitment is subject to customary conditions for financings of this type. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under its existing 5 year revolving credit facility, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Forward looking Statements In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers that the following important factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual results in 2004 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us. We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change, and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions, and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services, and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Our customers use many of our products to develop, test, and manufacture their own products. As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products. If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue. Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels. These activities require us to make significant investments. Products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can. The products that we are currently developing, or those we will develop in the future, may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace, and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our Measurement and Control segment sells products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries; downturns in those industries would adversely affect our results of operations. The growth and profitability of some of our businesses in the Measurement and Control segment depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns. For example, certain businesses in this segment depend in part on sales to the steel, cement, and semiconductor industries. Slowdowns in these industries would adversely affect sales by these businesses, which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. Adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in 2005 and beyond, resulting in: reduced demand for some of our products; increased rate of order cancellations or delays; increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories; increased pressure on the prices for our products and services; and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local, and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure, and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products. Demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2004 Applied Biosystems/MDS Scientific Instruments and related parties brought a lawsuit against us alleging our mass spectrometer systems infringe a patent held by the plaintiffs. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION If any of our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. The products sold by our environmental instruments division include a comprehensive range of fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation, and trace explosives detection. These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings, and other high threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could pass through the product undetected, which could lead to product liability claims. There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all. We have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold. From 1997 through 2004, we divested over 60 businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of $2 billion. As part of these transactions, we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses, such as lawsuits, product liability claims, and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however, we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. Our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future benefits from new productivity initiatives. In addition to the real estate consolidations and cost saving initiatives that we have pursued over the past three years, we are instituting practical process improvement (PPI) programs at our locations to further enhance our productivity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. While we anticipate continued benefits from these PPI initiatives as well as our continuing sourcing activities, future benefits are expected to be fewer and smaller in size and may be more difficult to achieve. Our branding strategy could be unsuccessful. We historically operated our business largely as autonomous, unaffiliated companies, and as a result, each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names. Our marketing and branding strategy transitions multiple, unrelated brands to one brand, Thermo Electron. Several of our former brands such as Finnigan and Nicolet commanded strong market recognition and customer loyalty. We believe the transition to the one brand enhances and strengthens our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company. Our success in promoting our brand depends on many factors, including effective communication of the transition to our customers, acceptance and recognition by customers of this brand, and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams. If we are not successful with this strategy, we may experience erosion in our product recognition, brand image and customer loyalty, and a decrease in demand for our products. It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including: finding new markets for our products; developing new applications for our technologies; combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; continuing key customer initiatives;  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION expanding our service offerings; strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; and continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings. We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business. As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In 2004, our international revenues from continuing operations, including export revenues from the United States, accounted for approximately 60% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the "functional currency"). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. In addition, reported sales made in non U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In fiscal 2004 and 2003, currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $92.1 million and $116.8 million, respectively, due to weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar would unfavorably affect revenues. Our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. We may not be able to identify and successfully complete transactions. Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. Further, we may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, we previously acquired several companies and businesses. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet, which amounts to approximately $1.51 billion as of December 31, 2004. We assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. These events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the companys currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The companys forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the companys short term available for sale investments and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2004 and 2003 market interest rates would result in a negative impact to the company of $5 million and $1 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments. A 100 basis point increase in 90 day LIBOR at December 31, 2004 and 2003, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by $1 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as long term. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling, and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2004 and 2003 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $106 million and $89 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year end 2004 and 2003 currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $5.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2004 and 2003 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of $3.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, on the companys net income.  THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION Equity Prices The companys available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2004 and 2003 market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of $10 million on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments, principally its available for sale investments.
