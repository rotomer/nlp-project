Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F 1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. In 2004, the company sold Spectra Physics, its optical technologies segment which has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. The companys continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Life and Laboratory Sciences and Measurement and Control. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. 2005 2004 Revenues (Dollars in thousands) Life and Laboratory Sciences $ 1,960,153 74.4% $ 1,573,445 71.3% Measurement and Control 672,874 25.6% 632,550 28.7% $ 2,633,027 100% $ 2,205,995 100% The companys revenues grew by 19% during 2005. The increase was due in part to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The strengthening of the dollar relative to non U.S. currencies caused a decrease in reported revenues. In addition to the change in revenues caused by acquisitions, net of divestitures and currency translation, which are discussed below, sales increased 4% in 2005, primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The companys strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2005 and 2004. The principal acquisitions included Ionalytics Corporation, a provider of an ion filtering device used with mass spectrometers, which was acquired in August 2005; the Kendro Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation, a provider of a wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation, processing and storage, which was acquired in May 2005; Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air, emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets, which was acquired in April 2005; Niton LLC, a provider of portable X ray analyzers to the metals, petrochemical and environmental markets, which was acquired in March 2005; InnaPhase Corporation, a supplier of laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets, which was acquired in September 2004; and US Counseling Services, Inc. (USCS), a supplier of equipment asset management services to the pharmaceutical, healthcare and related industries, which was acquired in April 2004. Financial Statement Index 24 Table of Contents In 2005, the companys operating income and operating income margin were $263.5 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $237.5 million and 10.8%, respectively, in 2004. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The increase in operating income was due to higher revenues, productivity improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases, offset in part by $54.8 million of higher amortization expense associated with acquisition related intangible assets. Operating income margin decreased due to lower operating margins on revenue from acquisitions as a result of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. Restructuring and other costs, net, (including charges to cost of revenues principally associated with the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition) reduced operating income by $30.3 million and $19.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The companys effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4.2 million for the estimated effect of tax audits of prior years in a non U.S. country. This charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The provision for income taxes in 2004 includes a benefit of $33.8 million associated with the settlement of U.S. and state tax audits of prior years. This benefit reduced the companys effective tax rate by 13.0 percentage points. Income from continuing operations decreased to $198.3 million in 2005, from $218.4 million in 2004, primarily due to the effect of tax audits in both years and higher amortization expense, discussed above, offset in part by higher operating income from increased revenues as well as an increase in other income. During 2005, the companys cash flow from operations totaled $270.9 million, compared with $264.5 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the companys outstanding debt totaled $598.8 million, of which 65% is due in 2008 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short term investments of $295.0 million as of December 31, 2005, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to $250 million under its existing 5 year revolving credit agreement and available unsecured borrowings under its 5 year euro facility are sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, restructuring and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Financial Statement Index 25 Table of Contents The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $21.8 million at December 31, 2005. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) The company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Goodwill totaled $1.97 billion at December 31, 2005. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary. (d) The company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those established at the dates of acquisition. (e) The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $931.5 million at December 31, 2005, including $280.7 million of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (f) In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. (g) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. Financial Statement Index 26 Table of Contents (h) The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. (i) At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties and returns based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $33.5 million at December 31, 2005. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (j) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $63.5 million at December 31, 2005. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. (k) The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $55.1 million at December 31, 2005. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (l) The company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation for which a loss is probable and provides a reserve for losses that can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those reserves may be required. (m) One of the companys U.S. subsidiaries and several non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for defined benefit plans totaled $16.1 million in 2005 and the companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $124 million at year end 2005. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension expense of approximately $3 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $31 million. Financial Statement Index 27 Table of Contents (n) The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income. The companys accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $9.2 million at December 31, 2005. Should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (o) The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations 2005 Compared With 2004 Continuing Operations Sales in 2005 were $2.633 billion, an increase of $427.0 million (19%) from 2004. Sales increased $337.3 million (15%) due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $4.5 million in 2005. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $94.2 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe. Operating Income Margin 2005 2004 Consolidated 10.0% 10.8% Operating income was $263.5 million in 2005, compared with $237.5 million in 2004. Operating income increased due to higher sales, including revenues from acquisitions, offset in part by the items discussed below. Operating income margin decreased to 10.0% in 2005 from 10.8% in 2004, primarily due to $54.8 million of higher amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets and $10.0 million of higher charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. These factors were offset in part by higher profitability from the increase in revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases. In response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the companys overall reorganization, restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2004 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. Restructuring and other costs recorded in 2005 were primarily for reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the integration of Kendro and consolidation of two facilities in Texas. The restructuring actions undertaken prior to 2005 were substantially complete at the end of 2004. The 2005 costs include charges associated with actions initiated prior to 2005 that could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided reserves due to changes in estimates of amounts due for abandoned facilities, net of expected sub tenant rental income. The company is continuing to evaluate potential restructuring actions that may be undertaken at Kendro or within existing businesses with which Kendro is being integrated. Such actions may include rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The cost of actions at Kendro businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Kendro are charged to expense. The company has not finalized its plans for integrating Kendro with its existing business but expects that charges to expense will ultimately total $15 $20 million, of which approximately $8 million has been recorded as of December 31, 2005. The company expects to finalize its restructuring plans for Kendro no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Financial Statement Index 28 Table of Contents In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30.3 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13.4 million primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23.2 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8.0 million primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $1.7 million principally for the writedown of a building held for sale. In 2004, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $3.4 million, consisting of $2.3 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $17.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $2.6 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1.0 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings (Note 15). The restructuring actions initiated in 2005 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2005 and early 2006 of approximately $13 million, including $9 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $4 million in the Measurement and Control segment. The company expects to incur an additional $2 million of restructuring costs, primarily in 2006, for charges associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until incurred. Segment Results The companys management evaluates operating segment performance based on measures that are not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles including adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin. Adjusted operating income is segment operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because they help management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation. Adjusted operating income margin is adjusted operating income divided by revenues. Life and Laboratory Sciences 2005 2004 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 1,960,153 $ 1,573,445 24.6% Operating Income Margin 12.1% 14.3% (2.2 ) Charges to cost of revenues 0.6% 0.2% 0.4 Restructuring and other costs, net 0.3% 0.4% (0.1 ) Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 3.7% 1.3% 2.4 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 16.7% 16.2% 0.5 Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $386.7 million (25%) to $1,960.2 billion in 2005. Sales increased $334.8 million due to the acquisitions of Kendro in May 2005, Niton in March 2005, InnaPhase in September 2004 and USCS in April 2004, net of divestitures, principally the point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $5.0 million in 2005. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $56.9 million (4%) due to higher broad based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products. Financial Statement Index 29 Table of Contents Adjusted operating income margin was 16.7% in 2005 and 16.2% in 2004. The increase resulted from higher revenues including the effect of acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, price increases and cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. Charges to cost of revenues relate to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and increased in 2005 due to the Kendro acquisition. The increase in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was primarily due to the acquisition of Kendro, and, to a lesser extent, other businesses. Measurement and Control 2005 2004 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 672,874 $ 632,550 6.4% Operating Income Margin 9.5% 8.4% 1.1 Charges to cost of revenues 0.1% 0.0% 0.1 Restructuring and other costs, net 1.5% 1.0% 0.5 Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 0.8% 0.5% 0.3 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 11.9% 9.9% 2.0 Sales in the Measurement and Control segment increased $40.3 million (6%) to $672.9 million in 2005. Sales increased $2.4 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $0.6 million in 2005. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $37.3 million (6%). The increase was primarily the result of higher demand from industrial customers, particularly from commodity markets including steel, petroleum and cement and customers purchasing instruments for use in environmental and security applications. Growth was strong in Asia and, to a lesser extent, in North America. The increase in revenues was, to a lesser extent, due to price increases. Adjusted operating income margin increased to 11.9% in 2005 from 9.9% in 2004. The increase resulted from higher sales volumes and cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. The increase in restructuring costs in 2005 primarily related to the consolidation of two facilities in Texas. The increase in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was due primarily to the acquisition of R&P. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $22.4 million and $21.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively (Note 4). Other income, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. Interest income increased to $11.6 million in 2005 from $9.0 million in 2004, primarily due to higher invested cash balances following the sale of Spectra Physics in July 2004 and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $26.7 million in 2005 from $11.0 million in 2004, as a result of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and, to a lesser extent, higher rates associated with the companys variable rate debt. During 2005 and 2004, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively. The gains included $28.9 million in 2005 and $9.6 million in 2004 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss of $1.3 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport Corporation, in addition to other gains from the companys investment portfolio activity. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of the sale of Spectra Physics in 2004. The company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport and does not expect to report material gains or losses from investments in 2006. Other income in 2005 and 2004 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Financial Statement Index 30 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4.2 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The effective tax rate was lower in 2004 primarily due to $33.8 million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The companys federal tax returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the period 1998 to 2000. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits were realizable. In addition, audits of state tax returns were also completed in 2004. This tax benefit reduced the companys effective tax rate in 2004 by 13.0 percentage points. Contingent Liabilities At year end 2005, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in either of the pending matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 11 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations to address the accounting for obligations associated with EU Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The directive requires EU member countries to adopt legislation to regulate the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic waste equipment. Under the directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced. Depending upon the law adopted by the particular country, upon replacement, the waste management obligation for that equipment may be transferred to the producer of the related equipment. The user retains the obligation if they do not replace the equipment. FSP No. FAS 143 1 requires a commercial user to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and related FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations to waste obligations associated with historical equipment. The rules require that a liability be established for the retirement obligation with an offsetting increase to the carrying amount of the related asset. FSP No. FAS 143 1 is effective the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of adoption of the law by the applicable EU member country. The issuance of FSP No. FAS 143 1 is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) amends SFAS No. 123 to require that companies record as expense the effect of equity based compensation, including stock options over the applicable vesting period. The company currently discloses the effect on income that stock options would have were they recorded as expense. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required under current standards. The new rule applies to option grants made after adoption as well as options that are not vested at the date of adoption. SFAS No. 123(R) becomes effective in 2006. The company will apply the new standard using the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006. If the company had adopted this standard in 2005, the companys net income for 2005 would have been $13.6 million (or $.08 per diluted share) lower than reported in 2005. The company expects that adoption of this standard will result in a reduction in net income of approximately $16 million (or $.10 per diluted share) during 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which is the result of its efforts to converge U.S. accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards. SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) to be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during 2006. The company does not expect the new standard to have a material effect on its financial statements. Financial Statement Index 31 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The company had after tax gains of $24.9 million in 2005 and $100.5 million in 2004 from the disposal of discontinued operations and $43.0 million of after tax income in 2004 from discontinued operations. An after tax gain of $16.8 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the companys point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53.1 million in cash. Revenues and pre tax loss of the divested business totaled $29.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre tax income totaled $26.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after tax gains aggregating $8.1 million in 2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to a divested business. In July 2004, the company completed the sale of its Optical Technologies segment, Spectra Physics, to Newport. The company has reclassified the results of Spectra Physics as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. The companys discontinued operations (Spectra Physics) had revenues through the date of sale of $118.9 million in 2004. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2.2 million. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In addition, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra Physics of $45.9 million, net of a tax provision of $15.9 million. The tax returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses totaling $52.7 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded as a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations in 2004. In addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of after tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. 2004 Compared With 2003 Continuing Operations Sales in 2004 were $2.206 billion, an increase of $306.6 million from 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $92.1 million in 2004. Sales increased $134.4 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $80.1 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased demand, as described by segment below. Operating Income Margin 2004 2003 Consolidated 10.8% 9.9% Operating income was $237.5 million in 2004, compared with $187.4 million in 2003. Operating income margin increased to 10.8% in 2004 from 9.9% in 2003. Operating income increased primarily due to lower restructuring and other costs, net, and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues in each segment in 2004. Operating income in 2004 and 2003 was reduced by additional charges associated with restructuring actions initiated in those and prior years and certain other costs, net (Note 15). The restructuring and other items totaled $19.2 million and $45.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are discussed by segment below. Financial Statement Index 32 Table of Contents Restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, in 2004 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies in response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the companys overall reorganization, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. The actions initiated in 2004 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in late 2004 and early 2005 of approximately $10 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $3 million in the Measurement and Control segment. The actions initiated in 2003 resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in late 2003 and early 2004 of approximately $11 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $4 million in the Measurement and Control segment. In 2004, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $3.4 million, consisting of $2.3 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $17.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $2.6 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1.0 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings. In 2003, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $45.3 million, including $37.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the company recorded net charges of $3.4 million, to write down the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily buildings held for sale, to expected disposal value, and $2.0 million, primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to reduce the carrying value to disposal value, and for the writedown of assets at facilities being consolidated. These charges were offset by a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of a building and $0.4 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of a product line. The company also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $0.1 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (Note 15). Segment Results Life and Laboratory Sciences 2004 2003 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 1,573,445 $ 1,293,009 21.7% Operating Income Margin 14.3% 14.2% 0.1 Charges to cost of revenues 0.2% 0.0% 0.2 Restructuring and other costs, net 0.4% 1.7% (1.3 ) Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 1.3% 0.5% 0.8 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 16.2% 16.4% (0.2 ) Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $280.4 million (22%) to $1.573 billion in 2004. Sales increased $153.1 million (12%) due to the acquisitions of InnaPhase in September 2004, USCS in April 2004, Jouan in December 2003 and LMSi in November 2003, net of product line divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $66.7 million (5%) in 2004. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $60.6 million, or 5%, due to higher demand. The increase in demand resulted principally in higher sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, new anatomical pathology products and laboratory informatics. The combination of new products and a rebound in sales to industrial markets along with strength in pharmaceutical demand contributed to the instrument sales growth, offset in part by lower revenues in Europe where the recovery of demand lagged the U.S. and Asia. The increase in revenues was offset in part by $5.6 million of lower revenue from rapid diagnostic tests due to a weak flu season in 2004 following a harsh season in 2003. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents Adjusted operating income margin was 16.2% in 2004 and 16.4% in 2003. The inclusion of Jouan, USCS and LMSi, which have historically operated at lower profitability margins compared with the segments existing businesses contributed to the reduction and was offset in part by the impact of higher revenue. The decrease in restructuring and other costs, net, was due to the completion of several significant facility consolidation actions undertaken in 2003. The increase in amortization expense resulted from 2003 and 2004 acquisitions. Measurement and Control 2004 2003 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 632,550 $ 601,104 5.2% Operating Income Margin 8.4% 7.4% 1.0 Charges to cost of revenues 0.0% 0.0% 0.0 Restructuring and other costs, net 1.0% 1.7% (0.7 ) Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 0.5% 0.4% 0.1 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 9.9% 9.5% 0.4 Sales in the Measurement and Control segment increased $31.4 million (5%) to $632.6 million in 2004. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $25.4 million (4%) in 2004. Sales decreased $13.5 million (2%) due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. The principal divestiture was the segments test and measurement business, which it sold in October 2003. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $19.5 million (3%). The increase was primarily the result of a rebound in demand for precision temperature control products from the semiconductor industry and other process applications and, to a lesser extent, process instruments used by the materials industry and equipment used in metal production, particularly in China. Adjusted operating income margin increased to 9.9% in 2004 from 9.5% in 2003. The increase in operating income margin resulted from higher sales volumes and cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. The decrease in restructuring and other costs, net, was due to the completion of several significant facility consolidation actions undertaken in 2003. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $21.7 million and $35.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $9.0 million in 2004 from $19.7 million in 2003, primarily due to lower invested cash balances following the acquisitions (net of divestitures) in late 2003 and 2004 and the use of cash for the repurchase and redemption of company securities. Interest expense decreased to $11.0 million in 2004 from $18.2 million in 2003, as a result of the repurchase and redemption of debentures. During 2004 and 2003, the company had gains on investments, net, of $20.8 million and $35.5 million, respectively. The gains included $9.6 million in 2004 and $16.3 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and $13.7 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of FLIR Systems, Inc. The company obtained an equity interest in FLIR as part of the acquisition of Spectra Physics AB in 1999. Other income in 2004 and 2003 also includes currency transaction gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In addition, the company repurchased and redeemed debentures, resulting in a charge of $1.0 million during 2003. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 15.8% and 21.3% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2004 primarily due to $33.8 million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The 2003 effective tax rate was favorably affected by $9.0 million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards (Note 6) and $3.7 million of tax benefit from the sale of a business. These tax benefits reduced the companys 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates by 13.0 percentage points and 5.7 percentage points, respectively. In addition, the company reduced its effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points in 2003 through repatriation of cash from non U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in foreign tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $218.4 million in 2004, compared with $175.2 million in 2003. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of Thoratec shares and other items, discussed above. Discontinued Operations The company had after tax gains of $100.5 million in 2004 and $27.3 million in 2003 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The companys discontinued operations (Spectra Physics) had revenues through the date of sale of $118.9 million and $197.8 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2.2 million. The companys discontinued operations incurred a net loss in 2003 of $2.5 million, net of a tax benefit of $1.5 million. The improvement resulted from a rebound in the demand for lasers and photonics from microelectronics customers and other industrial markets served by Spectra Physics. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In 2004, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra Physics of $45.9 million, net of a tax provision of $15.9 million. In 2004, the company recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $52.7 million as a result of the settlement of tax audits of businesses previously sold. In addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of after tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. The 2003 gain consists of two pre tax components and two tax components. In 2003, the company resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained following the sale of businesses in its discontinued operations. In connection with the resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages estimated and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease obligations, the companys pre tax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of the related businesses increased by $27.1 million. In 2003, the company also sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations, Peter Brotherhood Ltd., and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior to 2003, including post closing purchase price adjustments. The company recorded pre tax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of $8.3 million, substantially as a result of these transactions. The company recorded a tax provision of $13.2 million on the above gains and realized $5.1 million of additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003, principally foreign tax credits. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $562.2 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $890.9 million at December 31, 2004. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments of $295.0 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $512.3 million at December 31, 2004. The decreases result primarily from use of cash, cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and short term debt to partially fund the Kendro acquisition. 2005 Cash provided by operating activities was $270.9 million during 2005, including $272.8 million provided by continuing operations and $1.9 million used by discontinued operations. Cash of $24.3 million was provided by an increase in other current liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the timing of payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations to customers. Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes on gains on the sale of investments. The company contributed $10.9 million of funding to a U.K. pension plan in June 2005 (Note 5). Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $19.7 million in 2005. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $17.9 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2005. The company expects to pay approximately $7.4 million of this amount for severance, primarily through 2006, and $1.3 million for other costs, primarily through 2006. The balance of $9.2 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 65% to be paid through 2006 and the remainder through 2011. In addition, at December 31, 2005, the company had accrued $6.3 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $2.6 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through 2006. The remaining balance primarily represents abandoned facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014. During 2005, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions and the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $933.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P, Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $43.5 million for the purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16.2 million. Investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $65.6 million of cash in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously divested business in August 2005. The companys financing activities provided $390.9 million of cash during 2005, principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015 and a net increase in short term borrowings of $119.0 million. The company received net proceeds of $27.2 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2005. In February 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of the companys common stock through February 28, 2007. The company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the impact of an interest swap arrangement. Under the Notes Indenture, the company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants. Also in May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company an uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short term money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three short term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the borrowings under this arrangement. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents In June 2005, the company entered into a five year revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 175 million euros. The facility carries interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. Under the facility, borrowings of one to six months duration may be drawn. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants include interest coverage and debt to capital ratios. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%. The company has refinanced the outstanding borrowings and intends to refinance future maturities with additional borrowings under the facility to the extent necessary for liquidity purposes. 2004 Cash provided by operating activities was $264.5 million during 2004, including $250.0 million provided by continuing operations and $14.5 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $25.8 million in 2004. Accounts receivable increased $27.6 million due primarily to higher sales of mass spectrometry and informatics product offerings. Inventories increased $21.5 million, due in part to increased production of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments in response to higher demand for these products. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $14.5 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra Physics, offset in part by the payment of retained liabilities from businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. During 2004, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions for $143.0 million, net of cash acquired (Note 2) and the expenditure of $44.5 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $171.8 million of cash in 2004. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra Physics to Newport Corporation for $300 million, including $200 million of initial cash proceeds. As a result of Newport assuming non U.S. debt of Spectra Physics that had earlier been expected to be retained by the company, and as a result of the post closing adjustment process, the company refunded $25.1 million to Newport (Note 16). The companys financing activities used $183.2 million of cash during 2004, including $183.7 million used by continuing operations. During 2004, the company expended $231.5 million to repurchase 8.4 million shares of the companys common stock. The company received net proceeds of $57.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2004. 2003 Cash provided by operating activities was $214.7 million during 2003, including $200.3 million provided by continuing operations and $14.4 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $53.6 million in 2003. A decrease in inventories of $27.4 million resulted from efforts to improve working capital. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $14.4 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra Physics, offset in part by the payment of liabilities for businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. During 2003, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant and equipment and collection of a note receivable. The company expended $134.9 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions (Note 2). The company expended $37.4 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions. In April and June 2003, the company received aggregate cash payments of $75.6 million, including $69.1 million of principal payments, plus interest, from Trimble Navigation Limited as complete and early payment of Trimbles note to the company. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents The companys financing activities used $663.6 million of cash during 2003, including $652.0 million for continuing operations. During 2003, the companys continuing operations expended $369.1 million to reduce short term notes payable. The company received net proceeds of $75.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options in 2003. During 2003, the company expended $269.1 million to redeem its debt securities (Note 10). In addition, the company expended $88.9 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, of which $57.8 million was used to repurchase 3.0 million shares of the companys common stock. The debt repurchases and redemptions have been made with the objective of reducing interest costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2003 2005 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $14.0 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold (Note 11). The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005, which are principally for its continuing operations. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment 2007 and 2009 and 2011 and 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Long term debt obligations $ 646 $ 208,161 $ 403 $ 252,958 $ 462,168 Interest on fixed rate debt 15,010 27,092 25,000 56,250 123,352 Capital lease obligations 1,014 2,104 2,159 2,845 8,122 Operating lease obligations 39,525 52,701 30,405 69,957 192,588 Purchase obligations 82,351 492 1 82,844 Total contractual obligations 138,546 290,550 57,968 382,010 869,074 Other Commitments (not on the balance sheet): Letters of credit and bank guarantees 33,849 3,809 365 133 38,156 Surety bonds and other guarantees 5,930 935 7,334 14,199 Total other commitments 39,779 4,744 365 7,467 52,355 $ 178,325 $ 295,294 $ 58,333 $ 389,477 $ 921,429 This table excludes $133.0 million of other long term liabilities, principally pension liabilities, $65.0 million of deferred income taxes and interest payments on $130.5 million of variable rate long term debt, as these liabilities are not fixed amounts or are not subject to fixed payment schedules. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2006, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $46 to $51 million. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations and available borrowings under its existing 5 year revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the companys currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The companys forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and Canadian dollars. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the companys short term available for sale investments, long term notes receivable and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2005 and 2004 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of $9 million and $5 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments. A 100 basis point increase in 90 day LIBOR at December 31, 2005 and 2004, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by $1 million. A 100 basis point increase in 90 day Euribor at December 31, 2005 would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by $1 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2005 and 2004 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $66 million and $106 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2005 and 2004 currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $0.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2005 and 2004 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of $2.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2004 market equity prices would have resulted in a negative impact to the company of $10 million on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments, principally its available for sale investments. During 2005, the company sold substantially all of its available for sale equity investments (Note 4). A 10% increase in December 31, 2005 market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $1 million.
