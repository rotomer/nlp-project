Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F 1 of this report. Thermo Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. announced on May 8, 2006 that the boards of directors of both companies had unanimously approved a definitive agreement to combine the two companies in a tax free, stock for stock exchange. The Fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell culture media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. The transaction was approved by both companies shareholders, in separate meetings, held on August 30, 2006 and, following regulatory approvals, was completed on November 9, 2006. Fishers results are included in the accompanying financial statements from November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. In 2004, the company sold Spectra Physics, its optical technologies segment which has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. Following the merger with Fisher, the companys continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents Revenues 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Analytical Technologies $ 2,425,821 64.0% $ 2,006,744 76.2% Laboratory Products and Services 1,406,637 37.1% 626,283 23.8 % Eliminations (40,841 ) (1.1 )% $ 3,791,617 100% $ 2,633,027 100% The companys revenues grew by 44% during 2006, including 32% from the Fisher merger. The weakening of the dollar relative to non U.S. currencies also caused an increase in reported revenues. In addition to the change in revenues caused by acquisitions, net of divestitures and currency translation, which are discussed below, sales increased 6% in 2006, primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The companys strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2006 and 2005. In addition to the merger with Fisher, the principal acquisitions included Cohesive Technologies Inc., a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in December 2006; GV Instruments Limited, a manufacturer of isotope ratio mass spectrometers, which was acquired in July 2006; EGS Gauging, Inc., a provider of flat polymer web gauging products, which was acquired in June 2006; Ionalytics Corporation, a provider of an ion filtering device used with mass spectrometers, which was acquired in August 2005; the Kendro Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation, a provider of a wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation, processing and storage, which was acquired in May 2005; Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air, emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets, which was acquired in April 2005; and Niton LLC, a provider of portable X ray analyzers to the metals, petrochemical and environmental markets, which was acquired in March 2005. In 2006, the companys operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2005. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125 million of pretax charges associated with the Fisher merger, described below, and $93 million of higher amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher merger. These items were offset in part by the inclusion of Fishers results from November 9, 2006 and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenues, productivity improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The companys effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset by non deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of tax audits of prior years in a non U.S. country. This charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. Income from continuing operations decreased to $166 million in 2006, from $198 million in 2005, primarily due to the items discussed above that reduced operating income in 2006 and the inclusion of gains on the sale of investments in 2005, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in 2006. During 2006, the companys cash flow from operations totaled $406 million, compared with $271 million in 2005. The increase resulted from improved cash flow at existing business and, to a lesser extent, cash flow from the Fisher business, net of $157 million in merger related operating cash outflows including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by Fisher that were paid subsequent to November 9, 2006. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.7 billion, of which 77% is due in 2009 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short term investments of $691 million as of December 31, 2006, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing capacity of up to $635 million under its existing 5 year revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, equity based compensation, restructuring and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $45 million at December 31, 2006. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the companys acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require that use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $6.18 billion at December 31, 2006. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled $8.52 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long Lived Assets The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $1.57 billion at December 31, 2006, including $1.26 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $45 million at December 31, 2006. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the companys net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $195 million at December 31, 2006. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $60 million at December 31, 2006. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value. Additionally, we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $16 million in 2006 and the companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $237 million at year end 2006. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $101 million. (j) Equity based Compensation The fair value of each stock option granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. The expected life of a grant is estimated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options as permitted by SAB 107. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all equity based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. (k) Restructuring Costs The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income. The companys accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006. Should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (l) Assets Held for Sale The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2006 Compared With 2005 Continuing Operations Sales in 2006 were $3.792 billion, an increase of $1.159 billion (44%) from 2005. Sales increased $978 million due to acquisitions (principally Fisher), net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $18 million in 2006. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $163 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and Europe and moderate in North America. Operating Income Margin 2006 2005 Consolidated 6.4% 10.0% In 2006, operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2005. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125 million of pretax charges associated with the Fisher merger and $93 million of higher amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher merger. The $125 million of charges includes $73 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of the merger, $37 million of accelerated equity based compensation due to a change in control occurring at the merger date and $15 million of in process research and development at Fisher on the date of the merger. The unfavorable effect of these items was offset in part by the inclusion of Fishers results from November 9, 2006, through the end of the year and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenue, productivity improvements, including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Restructuring and other costs were recorded in 2006 and 2005. Restructuring costs in 2005 were primarily for reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the integration of Kendro and the consolidation of two facilities in Texas, as well as charges associated with actions initiated prior to 2005 that could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided reserves due to changes in estimates of amounts due for abandoned facilities, net of expected sub tenant rental income. Restructuring actions undertaken prior to 2005 were substantially complete at the end of 2004. Aside from the $15 million charge for in process research and development existing at Fisher on the date of merger, discussed above, restructuring costs in 2006 include charges to close a plant in Massachusetts and consolidate its operations with those of an acquired Kendro facility in North Carolina, charges for consolidation of a U.K. facility into an existing factory in Germany, the move of manufacturing operations in New Mexico to other plants in the U.S. and Europe and remaining costs of prior actions. The company is finalizing its plan for potential restructuring actions that may be undertaken at Fisher or within existing businesses with which Fisher is being integrated. Such actions may include rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The cost of actions at Fisher businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition, while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Fisher is charged to expense. The company expects to finalize its restructuring plans for Fisher no later than one year from the date of merger. The company has finalized its plans for integrating Kendro with its existing business and expects that charges to expense will ultimately total approximately $16 million, of which $15 million has been recorded as of December 31, 2006, with the balance to be recorded as incurred. Also, the company has identified actions totaling $5 million that will be undertaken in 2007. The restructuring actions initiated in 2006 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2006 and early 2007 of approximately $11 million, including $6 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $5 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues consisting of $75 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $3 million for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $30 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. As discussed above, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for in process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8 million primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2 million principally for the writedown of a building held for sale (Note 15). Acquisition related intangible assets of $7.2 billion arose from the merger with Fisher, including $5.9 billion of amortizable intangible assets. The company expects that amortization expense associated with the Fisher intangible assets will total approximately $470 million per year. In July 2006, the company acquired GV Instruments Limited (GVI), a UK based provider of mass spectrometry instruments and accessories for $17.5 million, net of cash acquired and a post closing refund of $4.6 million received in January 2007. Subsequent to the acquisition of GVI, the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006, the OFT referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction results in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers, thermal ionization mass spectrometers and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers. Of GVIs sales of $19 million in its fiscal 2006, $0.4 million were UK sales. The Competition Commission must prepare and publish its report within 24 weeks of the reference decision unless there are special reasons why it cannot do so. During the investigation, the company is subject to certain undertakings, which took effect October 2006, that require it not take any action that will lead to further integration of the GVI business with the company or otherwise impair the GVI business from competing independently. The company is cooperating with the Competition Commissions investigation. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of this matter. Were the Competition Commission to require that the company divest of GVI, charges for impairment of assets could result. Goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of GVI totaled approximately $22 million. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents Segment Results 2006 2005 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Analytical Technologies $ 2,425,821 $ 2,006,744 21% Laboratory Products and Services 1,406,637 626,283 125% Eliminations (40,841 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 3,791,617 $ 2,633,027 44% Operating Income: Analytical Technologies $ 383,640 $ 284,666 35% Laboratory Products and Services 189,229 86,600 119% Other 148 Subtotal Reportable Segments 572,869 371,414 54% Cost of Revenues Charges (77,625 ) (13,387 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (45,712 ) (16,900 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (170,826 ) (77,640 ) Stock Option Compensation Acceleration Charge (36,747 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 241,959 $ 263,487 (8)% The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of acquisition related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of stock option compensation resulting from a change in control. The company uses these measures because they help management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Analytical Technologies 2006 2005 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 2,425,821 $ 2,006,744 21% Operating Income Margin 15.8% 14.2% 1.6 pts. Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $419 million to $2.426 billion in 2006. Sales increased $249 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $10 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $160 million (8%) due to higher broad based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products and equipment sold in commodity markets such as steel, petroleum and cement. Operating income margin was 15.8% in 2006 and 14.2% in 2005. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues, and to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.4%. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents Laboratory Products and Services 2006 2005 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 1,406,637 $ 626,283 125% Operating Income Margin 13.5% 13.8% (0.3) pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $780 million to $1.407 billion in 2006. Sales increased $769 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $8 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $3 million due to an increase in demand for laboratory equipment. Operating income margin decreased to 13.5% in 2006 from 13.8% in 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of stock option compensation in 2006 following adoption of SFAS No. 123R, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.1%. Other Income (Expense), Net The company reported other expense, net, of $33 million in 2006 and other income, net, of $22 million in 2005 (Note 4). Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. Interest income increased to $16 million in 2006 from $12 million in 2005, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $52 million in 2006 from $27 million in 2005, as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher and, to a lesser extent, a full year of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and higher rates associated with the companys variable rate debt. During 2006 and 2005, the company had gains on investments, net, of $1 million and $35 million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport Corporation, in addition to other gains from the companys investment portfolio activity. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of the sale of Spectra Physics in 2004. Following the sale of shares in 2005, the company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport. Other income in 2006 and 2005 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset by non deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities At year end 2006, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. As described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 11, an unfavorable outcome in the matters described therein could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements As of January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123R Share based Payment. The standard requires that companies record as expense the effect of equity based compensation over the applicable vesting period. The company adopted the standard using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this transition method, the compensation cost recognized beginning January 1, 2006 includes compensation cost for (i) all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all share based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or, for 2006 grants, to the retirement date for retirement eligible employees, if earlier. Prior period amounts have not been restated. The company recorded $62 million of pre tax expense in 2006 for stock options, including $34 million the recognition of which was accelerated into 2006 as a result of the merger with Fisher causing a change in control. The stock option costs of $62 million included $7 million in cost of revenues, $51 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $4 million in research and development expenses. As of December 31, 2006, the company had $133 million ($85 million, net of tax) of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested equity awards, including unvested awards at Fisher on the date of merger that converted into awards exercisable over various vesting periods into shares of company common stock. The cost is expected to be recognized over approximately 3 years. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefits Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R. SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. The company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. The effect of adoption resulted in increases in total assets of $14 million, total liabilities of $9 million and stockholders equity of $5 million. In July 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under FIN No. 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money. FIN No. 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive, annual, tabular roll forward of the unrecognized tax benefits. FIN No. 48 will become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The company does not expect the effect of adoption to be material. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the company in 2008. The company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 157. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The companys discontinued operations reported after tax income of $0.5 million in 2006, representing the results of two small Fisher businesses held for sale. The company had after tax gains of $2 million in 2006 and $25 million in 2005 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The 2006 gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested business. An after tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the companys point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash. Revenues and pre tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre tax income totaled $27 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to a divested business. 2005 Compared With 2004 Continuing Operations Sales in 2005 were $2.633 billion, an increase of $427 million (19%) from 2004. Sales increased $337 million (15%) due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $4.5 million in 2005. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $94 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe. Operating Income Margin 2005 2004 Consolidated 10.0% 10.8% Operating income was $263 million in 2005, compared with $238 million in 2004. Operating income increased due to higher sales, including revenues from acquisitions, offset in part by the items discussed below. Operating income margin decreased to 10.0% in 2005 from 10.8% in 2004, primarily due to $55 million of higher amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets and $10 million of higher charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. These factors were offset in part by higher profitability from the increase in revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8 million, primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2 million, principally for the writedown of a building held for sale. In 2004, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $3 million, consisting of $2 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $17 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $3 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $192 million (11%) to $2.007 billion in 2005. Sales increased $96 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $4 million in 2005. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $100 million (6%) due to higher broad based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments; and, to a lesser extent, equipment sold to commodity markets including steel, petroleum and cement; instruments used in environmental and security applications; and anatomical pathology products. Operating income margin was 14.2% in 2005 and 13.1% in 2004. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenue, and to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following restructuring actions.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $235 million (60%) to $626 million in 2005. Sales increased $241 million due to acquisitions (principally Kendro), net of divestitures. Currency translation had an immaterial effect on revenues. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues decreased $6 million (1.5%) due to slightly lower demand for laboratory equipment used for sample preparation, processing and storage. Operating income margin increased to 13.8% in 2005 from 10.9% in 2004. The increase resulted from inclusion of higher margin revenues from Kendro as well as productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $22 million both in 2005 and 2004 (Note 4). Interest income increased to $12 million in 2005 from $9 million in 2004, primarily due to higher invested cash balances following the sale of Spectra Physics in July 2004 and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $27 million in 2005 from $11 million in 2004, as a result of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and, to a lesser extent, higher rates associated with the companys variable rate debt. During 2005 and 2004, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35 million and $21 million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 and $10 million in 2004 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport, in addition to other gains from the companys investment portfolio activity. Other income in 2005 and 2004 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The effective tax rate was lower in 2004 primarily due to $34 million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The companys federal tax returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the period 1998 to 2000. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits were realizable. In addition, audits of state tax returns were also completed in 2004. This tax benefit reduced the companys effective tax rate in 2004 by 13.0 percentage points. Discontinued Operations The company had after tax gains of $25 million in 2005 and $100 million in 2004 from the disposal of discontinued operations and $43 million of after tax income in 2004 from discontinued operations. An after tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the companys point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash. Revenues and pre tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre tax income totaled $27 million and $1 Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to a divested business. In July 2004, the company completed the sale of its Optical Technologies segment, Spectra Physics, to Newport. The company has reclassified the results of Spectra Physics as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. The companys discontinued operations (Spectra Physics) had revenues through the date of sale of $119 million in 2004. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2 million. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In addition, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra Physics of $46 million, net of a tax provision of $16 million. The tax returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses totaling $53 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded as a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations in 2004. In addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1 million of after tax gains and $1 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $1.507 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with $562 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to working capital acquired in the merger with Fisher. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments of $691 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $295 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to cash acquired in the merger with Fisher. 2006 Cash provided by operating activities was $406 million during 2006, including $407 million provided by continuing operations. A reduction in current liabilities used cash of $148 million, primarily as a result of merger related payments made following completion of the transaction totaling $157 million, including executive severance and retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred by Fisher. Cash of $32 million was provided by collections on accounts receivable. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $30 million during 2006. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $20 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2006. The company expects to pay approximately $7 million of this amount for severance and retention, primarily through 2007, and $1 million for other costs, primarily through 2007. The balance of $12 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 67% to be paid through 2007 and the remainder through 2013. In addition, at December 31, 2006, the company had accrued $35 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $30 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through 2007. The remaining balance primarily represents abandoned facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents During 2006, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant and equipment and the sale of product lines. Cash acquired in the merger with Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction costs. The company expended $132 million on acquisitions and $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company partially liquidated assets totaling $40 million in a Fisher retirement trust to fund payments that were due to former Fisher executives following the merger. The company had proceeds from the sale of product lines of $9 million. Investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006, primarily additional proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004. In January 2007, the company acquired two businesses for an aggregate of $20 million. In February 2007, Newport repaid in full its note payable to the company, totaling $48 million. The companys financing activities used $260 million of cash during 2006, principally for the repurchase of $300 million of the companys common stock and the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset in part by short term borrowing and proceeds of stock option exercises. The company increased short term borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had proceeds of $180 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $17 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. In 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $300 million of the companys common stock through February 28, 2007. At December 31, 2006, no remaining authorization existed for future repurchases. In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the companys common stock through February 28, 2008. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2007, such expenditures will approximate $240 $260 million. On August 29, 2006, the company negotiated a new $1 billion revolving credit agreement that became effective at the time of the merger with Fisher and replaced the companys existing credit facilities. At December 31, 2006, borrowings of $635 million were available under the revolving credit agreement. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under its existing revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2005 Cash provided by operating activities was $271 million during 2005, including $273 million provided by continuing operations and $2 million used by discontinued operations. Cash of $24 million was provided by an increase in other current liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the timing of payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations to customers. Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes on gains on the sale of investments. The company contributed $11 million of funding to a U.K. pension plan in June 2005 (Note 5). Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $20 million in 2005. During 2005, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions and the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $933 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P, Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $44 million for the purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16 million. Investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $66 million of cash in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously divested business in August 2005. The companys financing activities provided $391 million of cash during 2005, principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015 and a net increase in short term borrowings of $119 million. The company received net proceeds of $27 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2005. The company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the impact of an interest rate swap arrangement. Under the Notes Indenture, the company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents Also in May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company an uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short term money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three short term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the borrowings under this arrangement. In June 2005, the company entered into a five year revolving credit facility with a bank group that provided up to 175 million euros. The facility carried interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%. The facility was terminated in 2006. 2004 Cash provided by operating activities was $265 million during 2004, including $250 million provided by continuing operations and $15 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $26 million in 2004. Accounts receivable increased $34 million due primarily to higher sales of mass spectrometry and informatics product offerings. Inventories increased $21 million, due in part to increased production of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments in response to higher demand for these products. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $15 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra Physics, offset in part by the payment of retained liabilities from businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. During 2004, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions for $143 million, net of cash acquired (Note 2) and the expenditure of $44 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $172 million of cash in 2004. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra Physics to Newport Corporation for $300 million, including $200 million of initial cash proceeds. As a result of Newport assuming non U.S. debt of Spectra Physics that had earlier been expected to be retained by the company, and as a result of the post closing adjustment process, the company refunded $25 million to Newport (Note 16). The companys financing activities used $183 million of cash during 2004, including $184 million used by continuing operations. During 2004, the company expended $232 million to repurchase 8.4 million shares of the companys common stock. The company received net proceeds of $58 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2004. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2004 2006 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $13.7 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment 2007 2008 and 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 and Thereafter Total (In thousands) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 478,912 $ 132,861 $ 591 $ 2,036,610 $ 2,648,974 Interest (b) 108,407 199,954 191,590 732,543 1,232,494 Capital lease obligations 4,386 5,944 2,743 1,956 15,029 Operating lease obligations 92,111 134,308 75,574 85,089 387,082 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 110,773 7,103 984 111 118,971 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 70,014 6,303 151 160 76,628 Surety bonds and other guarantees 28,832 8,358 37,190 Other (d) 15,350 15,350 $ 908,785 $ 486,473 $ 271,633 $ 2,864,827 $ 4,531,718 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2006, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. The company holds an investment in a joint venture whereby the current party has a right to require the company to purchase its interest beginning in 2008. The purchase price is based on a multiple of pretax earnings. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2007, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $240 to $260 million. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the companys currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The companys forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and Swiss francs. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the companys short term available for sale investments, long term notes receivable and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2006 and 2005 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of $84 million and $9 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments. A 100 basis point increase in 90 day LIBOR at December 31, 2006 and 2005, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by $9 million and $1 million, respectively. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2006 and 2005 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $324 million and $66 million, respectively. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2006 and 2005 currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $7 million and $1 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2006 and 2005 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $5 million and $3 million, respectively, on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. The company assumed Fishers convertible debt at the date of the merger. A 10% increase in year end 2006 and 2005 market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $128 million and $1 million, respectively.
