Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F 1 of this report. Thermo Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. completed a merger of the two companies on November 9, 2006 in a tax free, stock for stock exchange. The Fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell culture media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. Fishers results are included in the accompanying financial statements from November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. To assist in year over year comparisons, certain information in the following discussion of the companys results of operations has been presented on a pro forma basis, as if the two companies had been combined from the beginning of 2006. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. Following the merger with Fisher, the companys continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Revenues: Analytical Technologies $ 4,256.0 43.7% $ 2,425.8 64.0% Laboratory Products and Services 5,842.2 59.9% 1,406.6 37.1% Eliminations (351.8 ) (3.6)% (40.8 ) (1.1)% $ 9,746.4 100% $ 3,791.6 100% Sales in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales increased principally due to the merger with Fisher as well as other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation. If the merger with Fisher had occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $876 million (10%), over pro forma 2006 revenues. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made by both companies and currency translation (discussed in total and by segment below), revenues increased over pro forma 2006 revenues by $507 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand, discussed below, and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The companys strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2007 and 2006. In addition to the merger with Fisher, the principal acquisitions included La Pha Pack, a manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories in December 2007; Priority Solutions International, a third party provider to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in October 2007; NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., a supplier of UV Vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific instruments in October 2007; Qualigens Fine Chemicals, a chemical manufacturer and supplier in September 2007 and Cohesive Technologies Inc., a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in December 2006. In 2007, the companys operating income and operating income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The increase in operating income was due to the Fisher merger and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity improvements and $125 million of pre tax charges in 2006 associated with the Fisher merger, described below. These increases were offset in part by $400 million of higher amortization expense as a result of acquisition related intangible assets from the Fisher merger and other acquisitions. The companys effective tax rate was 11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by a one time benefit of enacted reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on the companys deferred tax balances. This benefit totaled $32 million. In addition to the impact of this item, the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007, compared with 2006, was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges and amortization associated with the Fisher merger, together with the impact of an increased U.S. tax credit for foreign taxes, an enhanced tax credit for qualifying U.S. research costs and growth in lower tax regions such as Asia. Income from continuing operations increased to $780 million in 2007 from $166 million in 2006, primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income in 2007 and the one time tax benefit discussed above, offset in part by higher interest expense, primarily associated with debt assumed in the Fisher merger. During 2007, the companys cash flow from operations totaled $1.48 billion, compared with $406 million for 2006. The increase resulted from cash flow from the Fisher businesses and, to a lesser extent, improved cash flow at existing businesses. Cash flow from operations in 2007 and 2006 were net of $78 million and $157 million, respectively, in merger related operating cash outflows, including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by Fisher that were paid subsequent to November 9, 2006. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.20 billion, of which 93% is due in 2010 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short term investments of $639 million as of December 31, 2007, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing capacity of up to $955 million under its existing 5 year revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, stock based compensation, restructuring and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $49 million at December 31, 2007. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the companys acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require that use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $5.83 billion at December 31, 2007. The company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled $8.71 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long Lived Assets The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $1.67 billion at December 31, 2007, including $1.27 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $51 million at December 31, 2007. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the companys income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the companys level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the companys net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $197 million at December 31, 2007. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $64 million at December 31, 2007. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision or goodwill would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher as of the merger date, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value. Additionally, we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $19 million in 2007 and the companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $170 million at year end 2007. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $97 million. (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of each stock option granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. The expected lives of grants through 2007 were estimated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options as permitted by SAB 107. Thereafter, historical data on exercise patterns will become the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents (k) Restructuring Costs The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income. The companys accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $5 million at December 31, 2007. Should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (l) Assets Held for Sale The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations 2007 Compared With 2006 Continuing Operations Sales in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales increased principally due to the merger with Fisher as well as other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation. If the merger with Fisher had occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $876 million (10%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $128 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $241 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $507 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in Asia and, to a lesser extent, North America and more moderate in Europe. In 2007, operating income and operating income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. The increase in operating income was due to the inclusion of the Fisher businesses for a full year in 2007, $125 million of pre tax charges associated with the Fisher merger incurred in 2006 and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity improvements. These increases were offset in part by $400 million of higher amortization expense as a result of acquisition related intangible assets from the Fisher merger and other acquisitions. Restructuring and other costs were recorded during 2007 and 2006. Restructuring costs in 2007 primarily include merger related exit costs at existing businesses. The cost of actions at Fisher businesses has been charged to the cost of the acquisition, while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Fisher is charged to restructuring expense. In 2007, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially all related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on sale of a small business unit (Note 15). In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $30 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for in process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. The company has substantially finalized its plan for restructuring actions at Fisher or within existing businesses with which Fisher is being integrated. Such actions have included rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents In October 2007, the company decided to undertake closure of a Laboratory Products and Services segment manufacturing facility in France. The operations of the factory will be consolidated with those of existing factories in a phased plan through mid 2009. The company recorded $11 million of charges associated with this action in 2007. The company estimates additional future charges for retention, real estate abandonment, moving costs and accelerated depreciation on assets to be abandoned as a result of this action will total $7 to $9 million, including cash costs of $6 to $8 million, which will be recorded between the first quarter of 2008 and mid 2009, when the facility ceases remaining operations. Also, the company has identified other actions totaling $4 million that will be undertaken in 2008. The restructuring actions initiated in 2007 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2007 and early 2008 of approximately $11 million, principally in the Analytical Technologies segment. Segment Results (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Revenues: Analytical Technologies $ 4,256.0 $ 2,425.8 75% Laboratory Products and Services 5,842.2 1,406.6 315% Eliminations (351.8 ) (40.8 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 9,746.4 $ 3,791.6 157% Operating Income: Analytical Technologies $ 843.1 $ 383.7 120% Laboratory Products and Services 793.8 189.2 320% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,636.9 572.9 186% Cost of Revenues Charges (49.2 ) (77.7 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (42.2 ) (45.7 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (571.1 ) (170.8 ) Stock based Compensation Acceleration Charge (36.7 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 974.4 $ 242.0 303% The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of acquisition related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of stock based compensation following the merger with Fisher. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Revenues $ 4,256.0 $ 2,425.8 75% Operating Income Margin 19.8% 15.8% 4.0 pts. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $1.83 billion to $4.26 billion in 2007 primarily due to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased revenues at existing businesses and favorable currency translation. Had the Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $514 million (14%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $99 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $136 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $279 million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The increase in demand was from life science and industrial customers due in part to strong market response to new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments as well as environmental monitoring equipment and, to a lesser extent, process instruments and diagnostic tools. Operating income margin was 19.8% in 2007 and 15.8% in 2006. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had the merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 17.2% in 2006. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Revenues $ 5,842.2 $ 1,406.6 315% Operating Income Margin 13.6% 13.5% 0.1 pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $4.44 billion to $5.84 billion in 2007, primarily due to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions. Had the Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $405 million (7%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $30 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $106 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $269 million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales made through the segments research market channel, which includes the Fisher catalog, and revenues from the companys biopharma outsourcing offerings were strong. Operating income margin increased to 13.6% in 2007 from 13.5% in 2006, primarily due to the price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions, offset in part by inclusion of Fisher revenues, which have a slightly lower operating margin than the companys legacy laboratory equipment business. Had the merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 12.2% in 2006. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $93 million and $33 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively (Note 4). Other expense, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. Interest income increased to $47 million in 2007 from $16 million in the same period of 2006, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates. Interest expense increased to $140 million in 2007 from $52 million in 2006, primarily as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher. In August 2007, the FASB issued proposed guidance on accounting for convertible debt instruments that, if enacted, would increase the companys reported interest expense in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar non convertible debt. The change would not affect the companys cash interest payments. There can be no assurance at this time, however, as to the content of any final FASB rules on this topic. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by a one time benefit of $32 million, discussed below. In addition to the impact of this item, the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges and amortization associated with the Fisher merger, together with the impact of an increased U.S. tax credit for foreign taxes, an enhanced tax credit for qualifying U.S. research costs, growth in lower tax regions such as Asia and, to a lesser extent, a tax gain in excess of the related book gain on the sale of a product line in 2006. In 2007, the United Kingdom enacted new tax legislation that will become effective on April 1, 2008, lowering its corporate tax rate. Denmark, Canada and Germany also enacted new tax legislation, with various effective dates, that will reduce the corporate tax rate. As a result of these changes in tax rates, the deferred tax balances of all the companys entities in these countries have been adjusted to reflect the new tax rates in 2007. Contingent Liabilities At year end 2007, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. See Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 11. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described therein could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the companys monetary assets and liabilities in 2008 and for other assets and liabilities in 2009. The company does not expect a material effect on its monetary assets and liabilities from adopting SFAS No. 157 and is currently evaluating the potential impact on its nonmonetary assets and liabilities of adopting SFAS No. 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable once made and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. The effect of adoption will be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2008. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141R, among other aspects, requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. The statement requires that cash outflows such as transaction costs and post acquisition restructuring be charged to expense instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price will be recorded at its initial fair value and then re measured as time passes through adjustments to net income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the company in 2009. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company in 2009. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this standard. Discontinued Operations Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition of GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006, the OFT referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction had resulted in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers (Gas IRMS), thermal ionization mass spectrometers (TIMS) and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers. The Competition Commission published its final report on May 30, 2007, concluding that the companys acquisition of GVI would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK in the markets for Gas IRMS and TIMS products. The Competition Commission has further concluded that a divestiture remedy was appropriate and has therefore required the company to divest of either GVI as a whole, or its Gas IRMS and TIMS assets (which together comprise the majority of the business), to purchasers approved by the Competition Commission. As a result of this divestiture requirement the company recorded after tax impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss primarily represents non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the business to estimated disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In February 2008, the company completed the sale of GVIs two principal product lines that required divestiture. Aside from the impairment loss related to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after tax gains of $10 million in 2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the companys estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business. The company had after tax gains of $2 million in 2006 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested business. 2006 Compared With 2005 Continuing Operations Sales in 2006 were $3.79 billion, an increase of $1.16 billion (44%) from 2005. Sales increased $978 million due to acquisitions (principally Fisher), net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $18 million in 2006. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $163 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and Europe and moderate in North America. In 2006, operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2005. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125 million of pre tax charges associated with the Fisher merger and $93 million of higher amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher merger. The $125 million of charges includes $73 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of the merger, $37 million of accelerated stock based compensation due to a change in control occurring at the merger date and $15 million of in process research and development at Fisher on the date of the merger. The unfavorable effect of these items was offset in part by the inclusion of Fishers results from November 9, 2006, through the end of the year and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenue, productivity improvements, including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues consisting of $75 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $3 million for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $30 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. As discussed above, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for in process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8 million, primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2 million, principally for the writedown of a building held for sale.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $419 million to $2.43 billion in 2006. Sales increased $249 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $10 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $160 million (8%) due to higher broad based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products and equipment sold in commodity markets such as steel, petroleum and cement. Operating income margin was 15.8% in 2006 and 14.2% in 2005. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.4%. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Revenues $ 1,406.6 $ 626.3 125% Operating Income Margin 13.5% 13.8% (0.3) pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $780 million to $1.41 billion in 2006. Sales increased $769 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $8 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $3 million due to an increase in demand for laboratory equipment. Operating income margin decreased to 13.5% in 2006 from 13.8% in 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of stock option compensation in 2006 following adoption of SFAS No. 123R, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.1%. Other Income (Expense), Net The company reported other expense, net, of $33 million in 2006 and other income, net, of $22 million in 2005 (Note 4). Interest income increased to $16 million in 2006 from $12 million in 2005, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $52 million in 2006 from $27 million in 2005, as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher and, to a lesser extent, a full year of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and higher rates associated with the companys variable rate debt. During 2006 and 2005, the company had gains on investments, net, of $1 million and $35 million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport Corporation, in addition to other gains from the companys investment portfolio activity. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of the sale of Spectra Physics in 2004. Following the sale of shares in 2005, the company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport. Other income in 2006 and 2005 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006, compared with 2005, was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset by non deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The companys discontinued operations reported after tax income of $0.5 million in 2006, representing the results of two small Fisher businesses held for sale. The company had after tax gains of $2 million in 2006 and $25 million in 2005 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The 2006 gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested business. An after tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the companys point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash. Revenues and pre tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre tax income totaled $27 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005 representing additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post closing adjustments, and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to divested businesses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $1.76 billion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in short term borrowings. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments of $639 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $691 million at December 31, 2006. 2007 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.48 billion during 2007. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $125 million in 2007. The company did not make significant U.S. estimated tax payments in 2007, primarily due to tax deductions for merger related stock based compensation and net operating loss carryforwards. The company expects to make tax payments of approximately $325 to $375 million in 2008. The company made $78 million of merger related payments in 2007, which reduced operating cash. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $40 million during 2007. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $19 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2007. The company expects to pay approximately $14 million of this amount for severance, retention and other costs, primarily through 2009. The balance of $5 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 23% to be paid through 2008 and the remainder through 2013. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the company had accrued $10 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $4 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily during 2008. The remaining balance primarily represents abandoned facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2010. During 2007, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, were acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $497 million on acquisitions and $176 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company collected a note receivable from Newport Corporation totaling $48 million and had proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $19 million, principally real estate. The companys discontinued operations provided cash of $31 million from investing activities, principally the sale of Genevac Limited. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents The companys financing activities used $929 million of cash during 2007, principally for the repayment of $464 million of short term debt and the repurchase of $898 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $345 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $97 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the companys common stock through February 28, 2008. On August 9, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $700 million of the companys common stock through August 8, 2008. At December 31, 2007, $102 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under the August 8, 2008 Board authorization. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2008, such expenditures will approximate $230 to $250 million. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations and available borrowings under its existing revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2006 Cash provided by operating activities was $406 million during 2006, including $407 million provided by continuing operations. A reduction in current liabilities used cash of $80 million, primarily as a result of merger related payments made following completion of the transaction totaling $157 million, including executive severance and retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred by Fisher, offset in part by an increase in other accrued expenses. Cash of $32 million was provided by collections on accounts receivable. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $30 million during 2006. During 2006, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant and equipment and the sale of product lines. Cash acquired in the merger with Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction costs. The company expended $132 million on acquisitions and $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company partially liquidated assets totaling $40 million in a Fisher retirement trust to fund payments that were due to former Fisher executives following the merger. The company had proceeds from the sale of product lines of $9 million. Investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006, primarily additional proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004. The companys financing activities used $260 million of cash during 2006, principally for the repurchase of $300 million of the companys common stock and the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset in part by short term borrowing and proceeds of stock option exercises. The company increased short term borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had proceeds of $180 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $17 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. 2005 Cash provided by operating activities was $271 million during 2005, including $273 million provided by continuing operations and $2 million used by discontinued operations. Cash of $42 million was provided by an increase in other current liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the timing of payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations to customers. Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes on gains on the sale of investments. The company contributed $11 million of funding to a U.K. pension plan in June 2005. Payments for restructuring actions of the companys continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $20 million in 2005. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents During 2005, the primary investing activities of the companys continuing operations, excluding available for sale investment activities, included acquisitions and the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $933 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P, Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $44 million for the purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16 million. Investing activities of the companys discontinued operations provided $66 million of cash in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously divested business in August 2005. The companys financing activities provided $391 million of cash during 2005, principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015 and a net increase in short term borrowings of $119 million. The company received net proceeds of $27 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2005. The company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the impact of an interest rate swap arrangement. Under the Notes Indenture, the company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants. Also in May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company an uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short term money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three short term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the borrowings under this arrangement. In June 2005, the company entered into a five year revolving credit facility with a bank group that provided up to 175 million euros. The facility carried interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%. The facility was terminated in 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2005 2007 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $12 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2007. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 and 2012 2013 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 147.8 $ 2.5 $ 0.6 $ 2,036.3 $ 2,187.2 Interest (b) 103.1 189.4 188.9 609.9 1,091.3 Capital lease obligations 1.5 3.0 2.9 0.6 8.0 Operating lease obligations 91.3 135.0 82.8 83.1 392.2 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 137.4 13.3 0.9 151.6 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 89.8 7.9 0.3 0.5 98.5 Surety bonds and other guarantees 19.2 2.0 8.5 29.7 Pension obligations on balance sheet 33.3 46.2 50.6 64.8 194.9 Asset retirement obligations 5.9 4.5 4.6 16.3 31.3 Other (d) 11.0 11.0 $ 640.3 $ 403.8 $ 340.1 $ 2,811.5 $ 4,195.7 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2007, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $79 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2008, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $230 to $250 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the companys currency hedging activities is to protect the companys local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The companys forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the companys short term available for sale investments and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year end 2007 and 2006 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of $181 million and $84 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments. A 100 basis point increase in 90 day LIBOR at December 31, 2007 and 2006, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by $4.7 million and $9 million, respectively. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2007 and 2006 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $297 million and $324 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $22 million and $7 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $26 million and $5 million, respectively, on the companys net income. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents Equity Prices The companys available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2007 and 2006 market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $184 million and $128 million, respectively.
