Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F 1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The companys continuing operations fall into two business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of customers. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 42.7% $ 4,153.9 41.1% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 62.0% 6,426.6 63.6% Eliminations (516.1) (4.7)% (470.8) (4.7)% $ 10,788.7 100% $ 10,109.7 100% Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures (discussed in total and by segment below), revenues increased from 2009 revenues by $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. The increase in revenues was offset by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season than in 2009, as discussed below. These factors decreased sales by approximately 2 percentage points. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percent age point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. The companys strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2010 and 2009. The companys principal acquisitions are described below. Fermentas, a manufacturer and global distributor of enzymes, reagents and kits for molecular and cellular biology research, was acquired in July 2010 to expand the companys ability to provide complete workflows for genomics research. Finnzymes, a provider of integrated tools for molecular biology analysis, including reagents, instruments, consumables and kits, was acquired in March 2010 to expand the companys portfolio of reagents and other consumables for the molecular biology research and diagnostics markets. Ahura Scientific, a provider of handheld spectroscopy instruments that are used worldwide in the identification of chemicals for safety, security and pharmaceutical applications, was acquired in February 2010 to expand the companys portfolio of portable analytical devices. B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests based on patented biomarkers for sepsis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as intensive care treatments and prenatal screening, was acquired in October 2009 to increase the breadth of the companys specialty diagnostics portfolio and provide a significant reagent manufacturing center in Europe. Biolab, an Australia based provider of analytical instruments, life science consumables and laboratory equipment, was acquired in April 2009 to broaden the geographic reach of the companys customer channels. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) On December 13, 2010, the company and Dionex Corporation, a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems, announced that their Boards of Directors unanimously approved a transaction under which Thermo Fisher will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dionex for $118.50 per share in cash, or a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. Dionex, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis. Dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences, chemical, petrochemical, food and beverage, power generation, and electronics industries. Their expertise in applications and instrumentatio n helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals, establish environmental regulations, and produce better industrial products. The transaction is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Income from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010, from $851 million in 2009, primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income, offset in part by a higher tax rate. During 2010, the companys cash flow from operations totaled $1.50 billion, compared with $1.66 billion for 2009. The decrease resulted primarily from increases in working capital items, particularly accounts receivable and inventories to support the growth in sales. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock based compensation. Manage ment believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $40 million at December 31, 2010. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the companys acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $4.71 billion at December 31, 2010. The company reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled $9.27 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affec t projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. The companys businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010. Projections of profitability for 2011 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic recovery will continue into 2011 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the companys businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long lived Assets The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $1.90 billion at December 31, 2010, including $1.41 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are per formed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2010. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the companys income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The companys reserve for these matters totaled $62 million at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the companys level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax bala nces and hence the companys net income. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the companys tax provision. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $14 million in 2010. The companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year end 2010 compared with $225 million at year end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 4% Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) 10% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 7% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 984.2 $ 837.3 18% Laboratory Products and Services 931.8 877.6 6% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,916.0 1,714.9 12% Cost of Revenues Charges (16.0 ) (6.7 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (3.0 ) (1.5 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.4 ) (60.8 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (571.7 ) (597.0 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,264.9 $ 1,048.9 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 17.8% 17.0% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 11.7% 10.4% Income from the companys reportable segments increased 12% to $1.92 billion in 2010 due primarily to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) On December 13, 2010, the company and Dionex Corporation, a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems, announced that their Boards of Directors unanimously approved a transaction under which Thermo Fisher will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dionex for $118.50 per share in cash, or a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. Dionex, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis. Dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences, chemical, petrochemical, food and beverage, power generation, and electronics industries. Their expertise in applications and instrumentatio n helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals, establish environmental regulations, and produce better industrial products. The transaction is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Income from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010, from $851 million in 2009, primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income, offset in part by a higher tax rate. During 2010, the companys cash flow from operations totaled $1.50 billion, compared with $1.66 billion for 2009. The decrease resulted primarily from increases in working capital items, particularly accounts receivable and inventories to support the growth in sales. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock based compensation. Manage ment believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $40 million at December 31, 2010. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the companys acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $4.71 billion at December 31, 2010. The company reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled $9.27 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affec t projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. The companys businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010. Projections of profitability for 2011 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic recovery will continue into 2011 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the companys businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long lived Assets The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $1.90 billion at December 31, 2010, including $1.41 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are per formed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2010. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the companys income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The companys reserve for these matters totaled $62 million at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the companys level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax bala nces and hence the companys net income. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the companys tax provision. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $14 million in 2010. The companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year end 2010 compared with $225 million at year end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 4% Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) 10% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 7% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 984.2 $ 837.3 18% Laboratory Products and Services 931.8 877.6 6% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,916.0 1,714.9 12% Cost of Revenues Charges (16.0 ) (6.7 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (3.0 ) (1.5 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.4 ) (60.8 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (571.7 ) (597.0 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,264.9 $ 1,048.9 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 17.8% 17.0% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 11.7% 10.4% Income from the companys reportable segments increased 12% to $1.92 billion in 2010 due primarily to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010. Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 104.9 $ 355.9 $ 1,110.4 $ 530.9 $ 2,102.1 Interest (b) 48.6 94.5 77.1 148.4 368.6 Capital lease obligations 0.8 0.6 0.1 1.5 Operating lease obligations 103.9 144.1 80.9 68.6 397.5 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 197.9 13.1 211.0 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 68.4 7.7 0.1 20.2 96.4 Surety bonds and other guarantees 36.5 10.2 46.7 Pension obligations on balance sheet 24.0 53.2 59.7 109.6 246.5 Asset retirement obligations 4.0 4.9 2.3 11.4 22.6 Acquisition related contingent consideration accrued on balance sheet 27.5 1.2 28.7 Other (d) 6.2 6.2 $ 622.7 $ 685.4 $ 1,330.6 $ 889.1 $ 3,527.8 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock based compensation. Manage ment believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $40 million at December 31, 2010. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the companys acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $4.71 billion at December 31, 2010. The company reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled $9.27 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affec t projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. The companys businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010. Projections of profitability for 2011 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic recovery will continue into 2011 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the companys businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long lived Assets The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $1.90 billion at December 31, 2010, including $1.41 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are per formed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2010. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the companys income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The companys reserve for these matters totaled $62 million at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the companys level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax bala nces and hence the companys net income. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the companys tax provision. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $14 million in 2010. The companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year end 2010 compared with $225 million at year end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 4% Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) 10% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 7% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 984.2 $ 837.3 18% Laboratory Products and Services 931.8 877.6 6% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,916.0 1,714.9 12% Cost of Revenues Charges (16.0 ) (6.7 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (3.0 ) (1.5 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.4 ) (60.8 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (571.7 ) (597.0 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,264.9 $ 1,048.9 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 17.8% 17.0% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 11.7% 10.4% Income from the companys reportable segments increased 12% to $1.92 billion in 2010 due primarily to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) 2009 Compared With 2008 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2009 2008 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 $ (314.7 ) $ (92.2 ) $ 43.8 $ (266.3 ) Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 6,455.2 (28.6 ) (127.5 ) 121.4 (22.5 ) Eliminations (470.8 ) (425.8 ) (45.0 ) 8.6 (0.5 ) (53.1 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,109.7 $ 10,498.0 $ (388.3 ) $ (211.1 ) $ 164.7 $ (341.9 ) Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010. Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 104.9 $ 355.9 $ 1,110.4 $ 530.9 $ 2,102.1 Interest (b) 48.6 94.5 77.1 148.4 368.6 Capital lease obligations 0.8 0.6 0.1 1.5 Operating lease obligations 103.9 144.1 80.9 68.6 397.5 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 197.9 13.1 211.0 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 68.4 7.7 0.1 20.2 96.4 Surety bonds and other guarantees 36.5 10.2 46.7 Pension obligations on balance sheet 24.0 53.2 59.7 109.6 246.5 Asset retirement obligations 4.0 4.9 2.3 11.4 22.6 Acquisition related contingent consideration accrued on balance sheet 27.5 1.2 28.7 Other (d) 6.2 6.2 $ 622.7 $ 685.4 $ 1,330.6 $ 889.1 $ 3,527.8 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled $9.27 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the companys analysis could materially affec t projected cash flows and the companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. The companys businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010. Projections of profitability for 2011 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic recovery will continue into 2011 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the companys businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the companys goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long lived Assets The company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long lived assets totaled $1.90 billion at December 31, 2010, including $1.41 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the companys revenue recognition would be affected. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are per formed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2010. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the companys income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The companys reserve for these matters totaled $62 million at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the companys level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax bala nces and hence the companys net income. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the companys tax provision. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $14 million in 2010. The companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year end 2010 compared with $225 million at year end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) 2009 Compared With 2008 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2009 2008 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 $ (314.7 ) $ (92.2 ) $ 43.8 $ (266.3 ) Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 6,455.2 (28.6 ) (127.5 ) 121.4 (22.5 ) Eliminations (470.8 ) (425.8 ) (45.0 ) 8.6 (0.5 ) (53.1 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,109.7 $ 10,498.0 $ (388.3 ) $ (211.1 ) $ 164.7 $ (341.9 ) Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customers acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The companys software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are per formed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the companys continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2010. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the companys income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The companys reserve for these matters totaled $62 million at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the companys level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax bala nces and hence the companys net income. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the companys tax provision. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $14 million in 2010. The companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year end 2010 compared with $225 million at year end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 4% Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) 10% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 7% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 984.2 $ 837.3 18% Laboratory Products and Services 931.8 877.6 6% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,916.0 1,714.9 12% Cost of Revenues Charges (16.0 ) (6.7 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (3.0 ) (1.5 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.4 ) (60.8 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (571.7 ) (597.0 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,264.9 $ 1,048.9 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 17.8% 17.0% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 11.7% 10.4% Income from the companys reportable segments increased 12% to $1.92 billion in 2010 due primarily to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) 2009 Compared With 2008 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2009 2008 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 $ (314.7 ) $ (92.2 ) $ 43.8 $ (266.3 ) Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 6,455.2 (28.6 ) (127.5 ) 121.4 (22.5 ) Eliminations (470.8 ) (425.8 ) (45.0 ) 8.6 (0.5 ) (53.1 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,109.7 $ 10,498.0 $ (388.3 ) $ (211.1 ) $ 164.7 $ (341.9 ) Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010. Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 104.9 $ 355.9 $ 1,110.4 $ 530.9 $ 2,102.1 Interest (b) 48.6 94.5 77.1 148.4 368.6 Capital lease obligations 0.8 0.6 0.1 1.5 Operating lease obligations 103.9 144.1 80.9 68.6 397.5 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 197.9 13.1 211.0 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 68.4 7.7 0.1 20.2 96.4 Surety bonds and other guarantees 36.5 10.2 46.7 Pension obligations on balance sheet 24.0 53.2 59.7 109.6 246.5 Asset retirement obligations 4.0 4.9 2.3 11.4 22.6 Acquisition related contingent consideration accrued on balance sheet 27.5 1.2 28.7 Other (d) 6.2 6.2 $ 622.7 $ 685.4 $ 1,330.6 $ 889.1 $ 3,527.8 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the companys tax provision. The companys tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the companys actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the companys tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the companys U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $14 million in 2010. The companys unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year end 2010 compared with $225 million at year end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) 2009 Compared With 2008 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2009 2008 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 $ (314.7 ) $ (92.2 ) $ 43.8 $ (266.3 ) Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 6,455.2 (28.6 ) (127.5 ) 121.4 (22.5 ) Eliminations (470.8 ) (425.8 ) (45.0 ) 8.6 (0.5 ) (53.1 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,109.7 $ 10,498.0 $ (388.3 ) $ (211.1 ) $ 164.7 $ (341.9 ) Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the companys stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which t ogether unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 4% Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) 10% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 7% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 984.2 $ 837.3 18% Laboratory Products and Services 931.8 877.6 6% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,916.0 1,714.9 12% Cost of Revenues Charges (16.0 ) (6.7 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (3.0 ) (1.5 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.4 ) (60.8 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (571.7 ) (597.0 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,264.9 $ 1,048.9 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 17.8% 17.0% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 11.7% 10.4% Income from the companys reportable segments increased 12% to $1.92 billion in 2010 due primarily to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010. Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 104.9 $ 355.9 $ 1,110.4 $ 530.9 $ 2,102.1 Interest (b) 48.6 94.5 77.1 148.4 368.6 Capital lease obligations 0.8 0.6 0.1 1.5 Operating lease obligations 103.9 144.1 80.9 68.6 397.5 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 197.9 13.1 211.0 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 68.4 7.7 0.1 20.2 96.4 Surety bonds and other guarantees 36.5 10.2 46.7 Pension obligations on balance sheet 24.0 53.2 59.7 109.6 246.5 Asset retirement obligations 4.0 4.9 2.3 11.4 22.6 Acquisition related contingent consideration accrued on balance sheet 27.5 1.2 28.7 Other (d) 6.2 6.2 $ 622.7 $ 685.4 $ 1,330.6 $ 889.1 $ 3,527.8 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business units acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Bio lab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The companys management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 4% Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) 10% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 7% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 984.2 $ 837.3 18% Laboratory Products and Services 931.8 877.6 6% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,916.0 1,714.9 12% Cost of Revenues Charges (16.0 ) (6.7 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (3.0 ) (1.5 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.4 ) (60.8 ) Amortization of Acquisition related Intangible Assets (571.7 ) (597.0 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,264.9 $ 1,048.9 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 17.8% 17.0% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 11.7% 10.4% Income from the companys reportable segments increased 12% to $1.92 billion in 2010 due primarily to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) 2009 Compared With 2008 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2009 2008 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 $ (314.7 ) $ (92.2 ) $ 43.8 $ (266.3 ) Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 6,455.2 (28.6 ) (127.5 ) 121.4 (22.5 ) Eliminations (470.8 ) (425.8 ) (45.0 ) 8.6 (0.5 ) (53.1 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,109.7 $ 10,498.0 $ (388.3 ) $ (211.1 ) $ 164.7 $ (341.9 ) Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million.

The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower re venues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the companys healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid 2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the companys strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax ba lances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the companys tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under Litigation and Related Contingencies in Note 10 could materially affect the companys financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customers consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the companys results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the co mpanys results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the s evere economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre merger Fisher product liability related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisitio n related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates.

The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008.

The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu te sts. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the companys research mar ket and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the companys revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The companys effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009.

Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The companys financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the companys common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The companys financing activities also included $77 million of proc eeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the companys common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the companys common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the companys common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the companys outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investors election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the companys election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured r evolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the companys future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the companys common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). T he companys financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold.

Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the compa nys cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the companys debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the companys debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the companys fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the companys debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the companys interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the companys annual pre tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the companys reporting currency as permanent. The companys investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the companys international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the companys net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates related to the companys contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the companys cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year end 2010 non functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the companys net income. Equity Prices The companys convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the companys common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the companys convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the companys convertible obligations by $45 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the companys primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The companys financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the companys common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing arrangements in 2008 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the companys own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.
