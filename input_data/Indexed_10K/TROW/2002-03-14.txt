ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to U.S. individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios. We manage a broad range of U.S. domestic and international stock, bond, and 14 money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations. Total assets under our management were $156.3 billion at December 31, 2001, including $114.2 billion in equity securities and $42.1 billion in fixed income investments. This reflects a $10.4 billion, or 6%, decrease from the $166.7 billion that we managed at the end of 2000. ACQUISITION. On August 8, 2000, we purchased Robert Fleming Holdings 50% interest in our consolidated subsidiary, T. Rowe Price International, which at that time managed $37.5 billion. This purchase transaction resulted in goodwill of $704 million. Coincident with the change in ownership, our international investment research contracts with Robert Fleming affiliates were terminated. During the period through June 30, 2001, we incurred substantial costs to establish and transition to the new operating infrastructure for our international investment operations. Robert Fleming affiliates previously provided the space and infrastructure for this subsidiarys international offices. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. Through our new subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services, we expanded our marketing efforts in 2001 to European investors, a move which complements our efforts in Japan that began in 1999 through the Daiwa SB Investments venture and our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Global Asset Management. Investors outside the United States now account for more than 1% of our assets under management. Our expenditures to broaden our investor base may be significant and will precede revenues from any new investment advisory clients that we may obtain. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 2001 versus 2000. Net income decreased $73.2 million, or 27%, to $196 million, and diluted earnings per share fell from $2.08 to $1.52. A full years amortization of goodwill arising from the T. Rowe Price International acquisition accounted for $.13 of the decline. Total revenues declined 15% from $1.2 billion to just over $1.0 billion. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds decreased $101 million as average fund assets under management were $98.7 billion during 2001, $15.2 billion less than in 2000. Weakness in financial market valuations that began in 2000 continued through 2001. The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 pushed financial markets down to their lowest levels of the year before they recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter. Mutual fund assets ended the year at $98.0 billion, down $750 million from the 2001 average and $8.3 billion from the start of 2001. 15 The Science & Technology Fund and the international funds accounted for $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of the $8.6 billion net decline in mutual fund valuations during 2001. Dividends paid by the mutual funds, net of reinvestments, were $.2 billion in 2001. Net inflows from fund investors were $.5 billion in 2001. Domestic stock funds had net investor subscriptions of more than $1.8 billion while money market and bond fund investors added almost $.7 billion. Two U.S. growth funds led the inflows with the Small Cap Stock and Blue Chip Growth Funds adding a total of $1.4 billion from investors. International stock funds had net outflows of $2.0 billion. Assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage fell $2.1 billion during 2001, and our advisory fees thereon were down $30.4 million. While the same financial market declines played a significant role in reducing these assets, cash inflows, primarily from third party distribution efforts and international initiatives, added about $2.9 billion to assets under management in 2001. Additionally, adverse market conditions pushed performance related advisory fees down $10.3 million in 2001. We earn these fees primarily from a managed disposition service for distributions of venture capital investments and, though recurring, these fees vary significantly as market conditions and investment portfolios change. Administrative revenues were down $17.2 million from 2000. Discount brokerage commissions fell $10.0 million from the prior year as investor trading activity and average commission rates were lower. Other administrative revenues declined $7.2 million but were mostly offset by lower costs of the services that we provide to the mutual funds and defined contribution retirement plans. Investment income declined $26.3 million to $32.8 million, with smaller cash and mutual fund holdings as well as lower interest rates in 2001 accounting for the decline. Gains from our venture capital investments in 2000 that did not recur in 2001 were mostly offset by $11.3 million of greater realized gains from 2001 dispositions of our available for sale mutual fund holdings. We expect that investment income in the first half of 2002 will generally be lower than that of the comparable 2001 period. Operating expenses declined about 8% from $754 million in 2000 to $697 million in 2001. Compensation and related costs is our largest expense and was up only 1% or $4.3 million from 2000. Our average staff size was up about 2% versus 2000 but performance based bonus expense and the use of temporary personnel by our information technology operations were down in 2001. Staff reductions, primarily in November 2001, together with attrition during the year reduced our staff to 3,650 associates at December 31, 2001, a 9% reduction from the end of 2000. Our advertising and promotion expense decreased almost 27% or $23.6 million to $64.6 million in 2001 as we curtailed these expenditures due to weak financial market conditions that have made investors more cautious and less active. We vary our spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the United States and internationally. We expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first half of 2002 to be 16 less than in the comparable 2001 period. Market conditions in the second half of the year will dictate our spending then. International investment research fees were eliminated in August 2000 at the time of the T. Rowe Price International acquisition. Occupancy and equipment expense was $7.8 million higher in 2001 due primarily to additional amortization from recently completed software and technology projects, as well as the expansion of our operating facilities into new space in London in the first quarter of 2001 and in Colorado Springs in the fourth quarter of 2000. For the first time in several years, no facilities expansion is currently underway. The next planned move will occur in late third quarter 2002 when our Tampa service center relocates to a new leased facility. A full years amortization of goodwill arising from the T. Rowe Price International acquisition and interest expense on our related indebtedness added $17.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, to our 2001 expenses. As a result of the issuance and adoption of new financial accounting standards, we will cease recording a recurring charge amortizing goodwill after 2001 and will evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for impairment on an annual basis using a fair value approach. We must adopt the new accounting standards on January 1, 2002 and complete certain transitional testing of the goodwill carrying amount as of that date. In order to perform this testing, we must first identify our reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill among them as of the beginning of 2002. We then have until June 30, 2002 to complete a comparison of the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying amounts of those reporting units as of January 1, 2002. If the fair values of the reporting units are at least equal to the carrying amounts of those units, then no indication of goodwill impairment exists and our adoption of the new accounting standard is complete. While we have not completed the prescribed transitional testing at this time, we do not believe that we will recognize any impairment loss as the result of adopting the new accounting standards. Other operating expenses decreased 25% or $29.1 million from 2000. As the international transition and several technology initiatives have been brought to a close, we have substantially reduced other operating expenses. The 2001 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher than that of 2000 largely due to the full years amortization of nondeductible goodwill. The effective tax rate will decrease in 2002 when the goodwill amortization ceases. Minority interests declined due to the 2000 acquisition and the elimination of the interests in a remaining venture in the first quarter of 2001. 2000 versus 1999. Net income increased nearly $30 million or 12% to $269 million and diluted earnings per share rose from $1.85 to $2.08. Total revenues increased 17% from $1 billion to a record $1.2 billion, led by an increase of $115 million in investment advisory fees. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds 17 increased $86 million as average fund assets under management were $113.9 billion during 2000, $13.1 billion more than in 1999. However, declines in financial market valuations pushed fund assets down $5.5 billion during the year. Net redemptions by fund investors were $1.7 billion during 2000. Defined contribution plans moved $2 billion to other advisers on the last day of the year, offsetting net inflows that had occurred until that time. The merger of a client into another firm and the restructuring of investments by a large state pension plan were the primary causes of the outflows at year end 2000. Other fund asset decreases were the result of our redemption of almost $.5 billion to partially fund the T. Rowe Price International acquisition and $.5 billion of dividends, net of reinvestments, that were paid out during 2000. Mutual fund assets ended 2000 at $106.3 billion, including $84.3 billion in stock funds. Assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage were also higher during most of 2000 and contributed $25 million of additional advisory fees. In addition, performance related advisory fees earned primarily on venture capital investments that we manage were $4 million higher in 2000. Assets in other portfolios that we manage ended 2000 at $60.4 billion, down from $65.4 billion at the beginning of the year due primarily to international portfolios which experienced both market depreciation of $3.3 billion and outflows of $1.5 billion during 2000. Administrative fees from advisory related services that we provide to the funds and their shareholders rose $39.6 million from 1999 to $236.9 million. This increase is primarily attributable to transfer agency and recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans and the Price mutual funds and includes $1.1 million of 12b 1 distribution fees received from the new Advisor class of mutual fund shares. Administrative revenues are largely offset by the costs that we incur in providing the services, including fees paid to third parties which distribute the Advisor shares to their clients. Discount brokerage added $1.4 million of the increase on greater transaction volume offset by lower average commissions arising from the shift to transactions originating over the Internet. Investment and other income rose more than $21 million from 1999 to $59 million. Net gains of $7.4 million on dispositions of our stock and bond mutual fund holdings in 2000 versus losses of $1.6 million recognized on fund holdings in 1999 account for $9.0 million of the increase. Higher returns on our venture capital investments added $2.9 million in 2000. The strong markets of late 1999 and early 2000 produced significant market gains and distributions from venture capital investments. Larger capital gain distributions resulting from our stock fund holdings added $2.0 million to our 2000 income. Foreign currency rate fluctuations arising from our yen denominated debt account for a positive change of $4.6 million as the losses experienced in 1999 largely reversed in 2000. Operating expenses increased 21% to $754 million. Greater compensation and related costs, which were up $51 million or 16%, were attributable to increases in our rates of compensation, including performance related bonuses, and an 8% increase in our staff size primarily to support our 18 growing operations. As of December 31, 2000, we employed more than 4,000 associates. Our advertising and promotion expenditures increased $14.1 million from 1999 to $88.2 million. International investment research fees were down $17 million from 1999 as the contract for these services terminated at the time of the T. Rowe Price International acquisition. Occupancy and equipment expense was $16.1 million higher in 2000 due primarily to the expansion of our operating facilities in Owings Mills in late 1999 and early 2000. Amortization of goodwill arising from the T. Rowe Price International purchase and interest expense on our acquisition indebtedness added $11.1 million and $9.3 million, respectively, to our 2000 expenses. Other operating expenses increased $47 million largely due to significant broad based technology expenditures that support established and new business activities. Additional expenses in connection with our international expansion also contributed to the higher expense levels. Costs incurred for defined contribution plan recordkeeping systems and the distribution of the Advisor class of fund shares also increased our expense levels; however, these charges were generally offset by additional administrative revenues. The 2000 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher than that of 1999 largely due to the new goodwill charges that are not deductible in determining our income tax expense. Minority interests declined $5.9 million due to the acquisition of Robert Flemings 50% interest in T. Rowe Price International. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During the three years ended December 31, 2001, stockholders equity increased from $614 million to nearly $1.1 billion. Stockholders equity at December 31, 2001 includes $12 million of unrealized investment holding gains, after provision for income taxes, and $34 million which is restricted as to use under various regulations and agreements arising in the ordinary course of business. Net liquid assets of about $103 million were available at the beginning of 2002. Unused committed credit facilities at the beginning of 2002 include $410 million expiring in June 2005 and $100 million expiring in June 2002. Operating activities provided cash flows of $290 million in 2001 as net income decreased from the prior year. Comparatively, 2000 provided net operating cash inflows of $323 million. Net cash expended in investing activities decreased $852 million from 2000 to only $9 million. This significant decline is attributable to the use of $783 million for the 2000 acquisition and the use of mutual fund proceeds to fund investments and capital expenditures in 2001. Cash used in financing activities was $282 million in 2001. This compares with cash provided by financing activities of $260 million in 2000. Net bank borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition provided cash of $295 million in 2000 whereas we repaid $205 million of those borrowings in 2001. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2000 compared with $31 million used to repurchase shares in 2001. 19 Dividends paid to common stockholders were $74 million, $11 million higher than 2000 as the per share dividend was increased. Anticipated property and equipment acquisitions in 2002 are approximately $30 million. These capital expenditures and further debt reductions are expected to be funded from operating cash inflows in 2002. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this Annual Report on Form 10 K, may contain certain "forward looking information," including information relating to anticipated changes in our revenues and earnings, anticipated changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management, our anticipated expense levels, and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking information as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed below. Further, forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues will fluctuate due to many factors, including: the total value and composition of assets under our management; cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios; fluctuations in worldwide financial markets, including those in emerging countries, resulting in appreciation or depreciation of assets under our management; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indices; the extent to which we earn performance based investment advisory fees; the expense ratios of the Price mutual funds; investor sentiment and investor confidence; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios; our ability to contract with the Price mutual funds for payment for investment advisory related administrative services provided to the funds and their shareholders; changes in retirement savings trends favoring participant directed investments and defined contribution plans; the amount and timing of income recognized on our venture capital and other investments; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to significantly expand our business internationally. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds determined to terminate or significantly alter the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Our future operating results are also dependent upon the level of our 20 operating expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of advertising expenses in response to market conditions, expansion of marketing efforts both within the U.S. and internationally, and other factors; variations in the level of compensation expense due to, among other things, performance based bonuses, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; changes in our operating expenses resulting from our acquisition of the minority interests in T. Rowe Price International, including any goodwill impairment charge, interest expense, and other costs of providing our international investment advisory services; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent system. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general, or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management. Accordingly, declines of financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income. We invest in our sponsored mutual funds, which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading; we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments. Mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk; that is, the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares. Each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices, credit ratings, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. The following table (in thousands of dollars) presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares. This potential future loss of value, before any income tax benefits, reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each funds lowest fair value per share during the prior twelve months. In considering this presentation, it is important to note that: all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day; it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted; and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below. 21 Fair value at Potential December 31, % of lower % of Potential loss 2001 Portfolio value Portfolio of value Stock funds Domestic $ 64,276 52 $ 52,973 49 $ 11,303 18% International 11,960 10 9,926 9 2,034 17 Total 76,236 62 62,899 58 13,337 17 Blended funds 5,726 5 5,235 5 491 9 Bond funds 41,285 33 39,456 37 1,829 4 $ 123,247 100 $ 107,590 100 $ 15,657 13 The comparable potential loss of value shown in last years annual report was $17 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of $190 million at the end of 2000. During 2001, we had net unrealized losses of $14 million in the value of our fund investments. Investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds, by their nature, invest in a number of different financial instruments. T. Rowe Price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds. In addition, investment holdings may be altered from time to time, in response to changes in market risks and other factors, as deemed appropriate by management. Interest rates on our outstanding debt under the credit facility expiring in June 2005 are reset at one to six month intervals. Our borrowing rate on this debt decreased from 6.4% on January 8, 2001 to 2.18% on January 14, 2002 as the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank cut short term interest rates throughout 2001. Should our cost of funds increase back to the 6.4% that we experienced about 12 months ago, and we make no repayments of principal on the existing outstanding balance of $90 million, our interest expense for a full year would increase by $3.8 million. The investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates change 1%, the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would decrease about $250,000. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen again in 2001, and an exchange rate gain was recognized on our yen borrowing. In evaluating exchange rate sensitivity, a loss of $1.4 million would be recognized if the yen strengthened 10% from December 31, 2001. Other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not material. 22
