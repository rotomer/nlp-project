Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). On April 1, 2004, Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) merged with a subsidiary of The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (SPC), as a result of which TPC became a wholly owned subsidiary of SPC, and SPC changed its name to The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. In connection with the merger, each issued and outstanding share of TPC class A (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights) and class B par value $0.01 common stock was exchanged for 0.4334 of a share of the Companys common stock without designated par value. Share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the second quarter exchange of TPC common stock for the Companys common stock in the merger. For accounting purposes, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with TPC treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, this transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination, using TPC historical financial information and applying fair value estimates to the acquired assets, liabilities, and commitments of SPC as of April 1, 2004. Beginning on April 1, 2004, the results of operations and financial condition of SPC were consolidated with TPCs. Accordingly, all financial information presented herein for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 reflects the accounts of TPC for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the consolidated accounts of SPC and TPC for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. The financial information presented herein for the prior year periods reflects the accounts of TPC. For more information regarding the completion of the merger, including the calculation and allocation of the purchase price, refer to note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this report. In 2002, TPC completed a corporate reorganization in connection with its initial public offering of common stock. For more information regarding that reorganization and stock offering, refer to note 3 to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this report. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As a result of the April 1, 2004 merger of TPC and SPC, total assets and liabilities increased by $42.99 billion and $34.23 billion, respectively, adding $8.76 billion to the Companys shareholders equity. 2004 Consolidated Results of Operations Net income of $955 million, or $1.56 per share basic and $1.53 diluted Net written premiums of $18.94 billion Net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $2.39 billion ($1.59 billion after tax), including $928 million related to asbestos, $290 million related to environmental, $500 million of construction and $300 million of surety related to the merger, $252 million related to a specific construction contractor and $113 million from the commutation of certain reinsurance agreements. Total catastrophe losses of $772 million pretax (net of reinsurance) and $511 million after tax, primarily resulting from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne in the third quarter GAAP combined ratio of 107.7, including 12.6 points from unfavorable prior year reserve development and 4.0 points from catastrophe losses Net investment income of $2.02 billion, after tax Moderating rate environment due to more aggressive pricing in the marketplace 2004 Consolidated Financial Condition Total assets of $111.82 billion, including $64.71 billion of investments; fixed maturities and short term securities comprise 92% of total investments Total debt of $6.62 billion, including $3.98 billion assumed in the merger Shareholders equity of $21.20 billion, equivalent to book value per common share of $31.35 CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The Company provides a wide range of property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and individuals, primarily in the United States and in selected international markets. Through its majority ownership of Nuveen Investments, Inc. (Nuveen Investments), it also has a presence in the asset management industry. Consolidated Results of Operations (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles $ 955 $ 1,696 $ 216 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of tax (243 ) Net income (loss) $ 955 $ 1,696 $ (27 ) Basic earnings per share: Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles $ 1.56 $ 3.91 $ 0.52 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of tax (0.59 ) Net income (loss) $ 1.56 $ 3.91 $ (0.07 ) Diluted earnings per share: Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles $ 1.53 $ 3.80 $ 0.52 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of tax (0.59 ) Net income (loss) $ 1.53 $ 3.80 $ (0.07 ) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 608.3 434.3 411.5 Diluted 628.3 453.3 412.3 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Companys discussions related to all items, other than net income (loss), are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. Net income in 2004 totaled $955 million, or $1.53 per share diluted, compared with net income of $1.70 billion, or $3.80 per share diluted, in 2003. The $741 million decline in net income in 2004 compared with 2003 was driven by $1.59 billion of after tax net unfavorable prior year reserve development ($2.39 billion pretax). That pretax net unfavorable prior year reserve development was primarily comprised of $928 million to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the Companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, reserve adjustments related to the merger of $500 million for construction and $300 million for surety, $252 million related to a specific construction contractor, $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer and other net reserving actions, the major components of which are described in more detail in the following segment discussions. Net unfavorable reserve development in the Commercial and Specialty segments more than offset additional income resulting from the merger and strong operating income generated by the Companys Personal segment. In addition, after tax catastrophe losses in 2004 of $511 million were $282 million higher than in 2003. The catastrophe losses in 2004 were primarily driven by four hurricanes that struck the southeastern United States in the third quarter. The rate environment continued to moderate in 2004 due to more aggressive pricing in the marketplace. Customer retention levels remained stable throughout the Companys insurance underwriting operations; however, new business volume in 2004 declined when compared with the combined new business volume of SPC and TPC in 2003. Net income in 2004 included net realized investment losses of $28 million, compared with net realized investment gains of $21 million in 2003. Net income of $1.70 billion in 2003 was a significant improvement over the net loss of $27 million in 2002. Results in 2003 reflected a favorable, but moderating, rate environment in excess of loss cost trends and a decline in unfavorable prior year reserve development. Those factors were partially offset by a $174 million increase in after tax catastrophe losses in 2003. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2003 was $309 million, including $339 million of charges related to reserve strengthening in the Companys subsidiary Gulf Insurance Company (Gulf). In 2002, the $1.49 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve development was driven by $1.39 billion of charges related to asbestos reserve strengthening. In December 2002, the Company increased its asbestos reserves to $3.40 billion, net of reinsurance recoverables, and fully utilized the $800 million pretax benefit under the Citigroup indemnification agreement. (For additional information see Asbestos Claims and Litigation). The net loss in 2002 included an after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $243 million due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142). Net income in 2003 included $21 million of net realized investment gains, compared with $99 million of net realized investment gains in 2002. Consolidated Revenues The Companys consolidated revenues were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Earned premiums $ 19,038 $ 12,545 $ 11,155 Net investment income 2,663 1,869 1,881 Fee income 706 560 455 Asset management 390 Realized investment gains (losses) (39 ) 38 147 Recoveries from former affiliate 520 Other revenues 176 127 112 Total revenues $ 22,934 $ 15,139 $ 14,270 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The $6.49 billion growth in earned premiums over 2003 was primarily due to the merger, and also reflected the earned premium effect of rate increases on renewal business over the last 12 months and strong customer retention levels throughout a majority of the markets served by the Companys insurance segments. Net investment income in 2004 increased $794 million over 2003, due largely to the increase in invested assets resulting from the merger. In addition, strong operational cash flows in 2004 contributed to the growth in invested assets. The average pretax investment yield in 2004 of 4.8% declined from 5.3% in 2003, due to a higher proportion of tax exempt investments and lower yields on fixed income securities and alternative investments. In addition, SPCs investment portfolio acquired in the merger was recorded at its fair value as of the merger date in accordance with purchase accounting, which reduced the Companys reported average investment yield in 2004. Net investment income in 2004 included $111 million of income resulting from the initial public trading of an investment in its private equity portfolio. Fee income in 2004 grew 26% over 2003, primarily driven by new business in the National Accounts sector of the Companys Commercial segment, as described in more detail in the segment narrative that follows. Asset management revenues of $390 million were generated by Nuveen Investments, which was acquired in the merger. Nuveen Investments gross sales of investment products in 2004 from the date of the merger totaled $19.86 billion. The Companys net pretax realized investment losses of $39 million in 2004 included impairment charges totaling $80 million, whereas net pretax realized gains of $38 million in 2003 included $90 million of impairment charges. Net realized investment gains (losses) in 2004 and 2003 also included losses of $44 million and $27 million, respectively, related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts which are settled daily. Further information regarding the nature of impairment charges in each year is included in the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this discussion. Other revenues in all periods presented primarily consist of premium installment charges. Earned premiums in 2003 increased $1.39 billion, or 12%, over 2002 due to rate increases on renewal business, growth in targeted new business and strong customer retention. Net investment income decreased $12 million, or less than 1%, in 2003, despite higher average invested assets resulting from strong cash flows from operations. The decline resulted from a reduction in pretax investment yields from 6.0% in 2002 to 5.3% in 2003. That decrease reflected the lower interest rate environment, the shortening of the average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, a higher proportion of tax exempt investment holdings and reduced returns in the Companys private equity investments. These factors were partially offset by higher returns in arbitrage fund investments. Fee income increased $105 million, or 23%, in 2003, as both new business and pricing levels in the Companys National Accounts business increased and more workers compensation business was written by state residual market pools serviced by National Accounts. Net realized investment gains were $38 million in 2003, compared with $147 million in 2002. Net realized investment gains included $90 million of impairment charges in 2003, compared with $284 million in 2002. Recoveries from former affiliate of $520 million, net of tax, in 2002 represent funds recovered under the Citigroup indemnification agreement. Effective with the merger, the Companys business operations consist of the following four segments: Commercial, Specialty, Personal (collectively comprising the Companys insurance segments) and Asset Management. The Asset Management segment was acquired in the merger. Prior period results for the three insurance segments have been restated, to the extent practicable, to conform with the 2004 presentation. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Consolidated net written premiums were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Commercial $ 8,213 $ 6,862 $ 6,330 Specialty 4,794 1,258 1,040 Personal 5,929 5,081 4,575 Total net written premiums $ 18,936 $ 13,201 $ 11,945 The $5.74 billion, or 43%, increase in consolidated net written premiums in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily reflected the impact of the merger. On a pro forma combined basis, net written premiums in 2004 were level with 2003. Business retention levels in the majority of the Companys insurance operations remained consistent with 2003 levels, as the Company focused on retaining its existing book of well priced, profitable business. Rate increases, however, continued to moderate in 2004, reflecting more aggressive pricing in the marketplace. New business volume in the Commercial and Specialty segments in 2004 declined when compared with the combined new business volume of SPC and TPC in the prior year, reflecting the competitive marketplace and the impact of new business premiums in 2003 from renewal rights transactions. The non renewal of certain commercial property, construction and surety risks and certain personal lines business in the Companys operations at Lloyds also negatively impacted premium volume in 2004. Personal net written premiums increased 17% in 2004 over 2003, due to strong organic growth, new business resulting from a renewal rights transaction, strong business retention levels and price increases. Net written premiums increased $1.26 billion, or 11%, in 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher but moderating rate increases, new business growth in favorable markets and strong retention across all major lines of business. These factors were partially offset by the withdrawal in 2002 of business at American Equity Insurance Company and Commercial Guaranty Casualty Insurance Company, both subsidiaries of The Northland Company (Northland), a subsidiary of the Company, and a one time additional $115 million of net written premiums in 2002 due to the termination of certain reinsurance contracts by Northland. Net written premiums for Northlands subsidiaries in 2003 were $547 million, a decrease of 34% from the 2002 total of $825 million. Commercial net written premiums, excluding business written in Northlands subsidiaries, increased $1.03 billion, or 16%, in 2003. Personal net written premiums increased $506 million, or 11%, in 2003. Consolidated claims and expenses were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 15,439 $ 9,118 $ 11,139 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 2,978 1,984 1,810 General and administrative expenses 3,145 1,641 1,424 Interest expense 244 167 157 Total claims and expenses $ 21,806 $ 12,910 $ 14,530 Claims and claim adjustment expenses of $15.44 billion in 2004 were $6.32 billion higher than the comparable 2003 total, primarily reflecting growth in business volume resulting from the merger. The 2004 total also included $2.39 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve development, of which $928 million represented a provision to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the Companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter and $290 million represented a provision to strengthen environmental reserves. Additional components of 2004 unfavorable prior year reserve development are described below. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2003 totaled $476 million and was primarily the result of reserve strengthening at the Companys Gulf subsidiary. The 2004 total also included $772 million of catastrophe losses (net of reinsurance), compared with catastrophe losses of $352 million in 2003. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During the second quarter of 2004, the company recorded $500 million and $300 million of net unfavorable prior year reserve development related to Specialtys construction and surety reserves, respectively, acquired in the merger. Upon having access to each companys detailed policyholder information, including underwriting, claim, and actuarial files on April 1, 2004, in connection with the closing of the merger, the Company was able to begin the detailed process of developing a uniform and consistent approach to estimating the combined companys loss reserves. As part of that process, a team of actuaries representing the historical actuarial perspectives, judgments and methods applied by each legacy company, discussed their views, methodologies, and analysis of available data. In addition to the discussion in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this report, other items specifically considered in the process of developing a uniform and consistent approach to estimating the combined companys loss reserves include interpreting the actuarial and claim data in a uniform manner and determining an appropriate level of data segmentation for estimation purposes. This type of analysis involves a high degree of judgment and can, and often does, lead to reserve estimates that differ materially from those of prior periods, particularly in low frequency, high severity and complex exposures. In addition, since the reserving process also considers the expectations of future outcomes, the actuaries involved had to analyze their differing views on key assumptions, such as predicting inflation, estimating claim development patterns and determining expectations related to judicial rulings and interpretations, among others. This informed judgment is brought into the process by individuals such as actuaries, underwriters, claim adjusters, and company management. Ultimately, this process required an analysis of the varying actuarial judgments and forward looking assessments. The result was similar to a single, ongoing insurance enterprise obtaining more information in a reporting period than it had previously and identifying a change in estimate in its insurance reserves in that period. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $500 million and $300 million charge for construction and surety, respectively, in the second quarter of 2004. Additional information on the analysis performed is included in the Specialty segment discussion below. In June of 2004, the Company decided to commute certain reinsurance agreements with a major reinsurer resulting in a $113 million prior year reserve charge (in addition to a current year loss of $40 million). Commutations are a complete and final settlement with a reinsurer that results in a discharge of all obligations of the parties to the terminated reinsurance agreement. The Company also recorded a charge of $252 million related to a specific construction contractor as described in the Specialty segment discussion. Other items increasing the 2004 claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $296 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables, policyholders receivables, and co surety participations on a specific construction contractor claim. The increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables recognized a change in estimated disputes with reinsurers and is based upon the Companys reinsurance strategy of reduced reinsurance utilization, including the cessation of ongoing business relationships with certain of SPCs reinsurers, and aggressive collection of reinsurance recoverables. A provision was also made to increase the estimated uncollectible amounts due from policyholders for loss sensitive business (primarily high deductible business). This increase recognized a change in estimated uncollectible amounts due and resulted from applying the Companys credit based methodology for determining uncollectible amounts to the recoverables acquired in the merger. Because reinsurance recoverables and amounts due from policyholders for loss sensitive business are insurance contract related assets, these assets are subject to the same types of estimation variables as loss reserves. Also during the second quarter of 2004, a participating co surety on a contract surety exposure announced that insurance regulators had approved its submitted run off plan. Based upon industry knowledge of the co suretys run off plan and an analysis of the co suretys financial condition, the Company concluded that it was unlikely to collect the full amount projected to be owed by the co surety and established an appropriate level of reserves. Other 2004 claims and expenses related to the merger include $29 million of restructuring charges, $92 million of amortization expense related to finite lived intangible assets acquired in the merger, and a benefit of $58 million associated with the accretion of the fair value adjustment to claims and claim adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables. Interest expense in 2004 included $100 million of additional interest expense on SPC debt assumed in the merger. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased $2.02 billion, or 18%, in 2003 primarily due to a decline in unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2003, which was partially offset by increased loss costs, growth in business volume and higher catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, were $352 million in 2003 compared to $84 million in 2002. Unfavorable prior year reserve development included in claims and claim adjustment expenses was $476 million for 2003, compared to $3.09 billion in 2002. Unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2002 included $2.95 billion of asbestos incurred losses (prior to the benefit related to recoveries under the Citigroup indemnification agreement), whereas 2003 included no asbestos related unfavorable prior year reserve development. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased $174 million, or 10%, in 2003, reflecting higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increases in earned premiums previously described. Interest expense increased $9 million, or 6%, in 2003 due to certain one time costs associated with first and second quarter refinancing activities that lowered average interest costs, and higher levels of temporary debt. General and administrative expenses increased $217 million, or 15%, in 2003, reflecting business growth and higher commissions that resulted from improved underwriting results. Effective Tax Rate. The Companys effective tax rate was 12.2%, 24.1% and (183.4)% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in the 2004 effective rate primarily reflected the impact of an increase in nontaxable investment income on a lower level of pretax income. The 2003 increase in the effective rate reflected a higher level of pretax income associated with improved underwriting performance. The 2002 effective rate reflected the impact of the 2002 asbestos charge previously discussed, as well as the impact of non taxable recoveries of $520 million related to the Citigroup indemnification agreement. The GAAP combined ratios before policyholder dividends were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (1) 79.4 % 70.7 % 90.5 % Underwriting expense ratio 28.3 25.6 26.1 GAAP combined ratio 107.7 % 96.3 % 116.6 % (1) Excludes losses recovered under the Citigroup indemnification agreement in 2002. The GAAP combined ratio in 2004 included a 12.6 point impact from net unfavorable prior year reserve development and a 4.0 point impact from catastrophes. The respective impacts of these factors on the 2003 combined ratio were 3.8 points and 2.8 points. Excluding these impacts from both years, the adjusted ratio of 91.1 in 2004 was 1.4 points higher than the adjusted 2003 combined ratio of 89.7. The increase in the adjusted ratio primarily reflected the impact of the higher underwriting expense ratio of the business acquired in the merger, as well as expenses associated with the merger. The 20.3 point improvement in the 2003 GAAP combined ratio resulted from lower unfavorable prior year reserve development, primarily due to having no asbestos charges in 2003, compared to asbestos charges in 2002 that added 19.2 points. The benefit from premium rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends were largely offset by higher catastrophe losses. Renewal Rights Purchases During the third quarter of 2003, TPC purchased from Royal & SunAlliance USA (RSA), an unaffiliated insurer, the renewal rights to RSAs commercial lines national accounts, middle market and marine businesses, and standard and preferred personal lines businesses. Also during the third quarter of 2003, TPC purchased from Atlantic Mutual, an unaffiliated insurer, the renewal rights to the majority of Atlantic Mutuals commercial lines inland marine and ocean cargo businesses written by Atlantic Mutuals Marine Division. The minimum purchase price for both transactions, which has been paid, was $48 million. The final purchase price, which is expected to be determined in 2005 and is currently estimated to be $66 million, is dependent on the level of business renewed by the Company. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Commercial Insurance Resources, Inc. On August 1, 2002, Commercial Insurance Resources, Inc. (CIRI), a subsidiary of the Company and the holding company for the Gulf Insurance Group (Gulf), completed a transaction with a group of outside investors and senior employees of Gulf. Capital investments made by the investors and employees included 9.7 million shares of mandatorily convertible preferred stock for a purchase price of $8.83 per share, $50 million of convertible notes and 0.4 million common shares for a purchase price of $8.83 per share, representing a 24% ownership interest of CIRI, on a fully diluted basis. The dividend rate on the preferred stock was 6.0%. The interest rate on the notes was 6.0% payable on an interest only basis. The notes would have matured on December 31, 2032. Trident II, L.P., Marsh & McLennan Capital Professionals Fund, L.P., Marsh & McLennan Employees Securities Company, L.P. and Trident Gulf Holding, LLC (collectively Trident) invested $125 million, and a group of approximately 75 senior employees of Gulf invested $14 million. Fifty percent of the Gulf senior employees investment was financed by CIRI. This financing was collateralized by the CIRI securities purchased and was forgivable if Trident achieved certain investment returns. The applicable agreements provided for registration rights and transfer rights and restrictions and other matters customarily addressed in agreements with minority investors. On May 28, 2004, The Travelers Indemnity Company (Indemnity), a subsidiary of the Company, completed its purchase of all of the outstanding shares (8,970,000 shares) of the mandatorily convertible preferred stock held by Trident at a purchase price of $8.83 per share and the convertible notes held by Trident for $46 million. By June 30, 2004, Indemnity completed its purchase from employees of $7 million of the mandatorily convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $8.83 per share, convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of $4 million, and common equity of $3 million at a purchase price of $8.83 per share. The notes that were previously issued to employees to finance 50% of their investment in CIRI were assumed by Indemnity as part of the agreement to purchase the employees investments in CIRI. The excess of the cost to repurchase the minority interest over the minority interest carrying value on the consolidated balance sheet was recorded as a charge to additional paid in capital during the second quarter. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Operating income in the following discussion represents net income excluding the after tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses). Commercial Results of the Companys Commercial segment were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Earned premiums $ 8,667 $ 6,552 $ 5,831 Net investment income 1,708 1,324 1,307 Fee income 680 545 446 Recoveries from former affiliate 520 Other revenues 55 33 28 Total revenues $ 11,110 $ 8,454 $ 8,132 Total claims and expenses $ 10,064 $ 7,131 $ 9,124 Operating income (loss) $ 862 $ 1,061 $ (310 ) Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (1) 80.0 % 75.4 % 109.3 % Underwriting expense ratio 28.2 24.9 25.5 GAAP combined ratio 108.2 % 100.3 % 134.8 % (1) Excludes losses recovered under the Citigroup indemnification agreement in 2002. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating income of $862 million in 2004 declined $199 million, or 19%, from 2003, which did not include the results of SPC. Included in 2004 results were $233 million of after tax catastrophe losses, compared with after tax catastrophe losses of $67 million in 2003. Also impacting 2004 operating income was net after tax unfavorable prior year reserve development of $802 million ($1.18 billion, pretax), primarily related to asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening. Net after tax unfavorable prior year reserve development totaled $439 million in 2003. Total revenues of $11.11 billion in 2004 reflected growth of $2.12 billion in earned premiums, which was primarily due to the merger and also reflected the earned premium effect of moderating renewal price increases over the last twelve months in the Companys core Commercial operations. In addition, incremental premiums resulting from the renewal rights transaction with Royal & SunAlliance in the third quarter of 2003 contributed to premium growth in 2004. Net investment income in 2004 increased $384 million over 2003 due largely to the increase in invested assets as a result of the merger, strong operational cash flows that contributed to the growth in invested assets over 2003, and investment income related to the initial public trading of an investment. Also impacting net investment income was the effect of a decline in pretax investment yields due to a higher proportion of tax exempt investments, and lower yields on fixed income securities and alternative investments. National Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self insure a portion of their insurance risks, and claims and policy management services to workers compensation residual market pools, automobile assigned risk plans and to self insurance pools. The strong increase in 2004 fee income reflected higher new business levels, resulting, in part, from the third quarter 2003 renewal rights transaction with Royal & SunAlliance, renewal price increases and more workers compensation business being written by state residual market pools. Claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 included $1.18 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the Commercial segment, of which $927 million represented a provision to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the Companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter and $286 million represented a provision to strengthen environmental reserves. The asbestos provision primarily resulted from an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants. With regard to the environmental provision, new claims for hazardous waste and pollution continue to decline, though the pace of the decrease has slowed. The average severity of claims has increased, however, leading the Company to conclude that reserves for environmental losses needed to be increased. In June 2004, the Company decided to commute certain reinsurance agreements with a major reinsurer, resulting in a prior year reserve charge of $38 million. Also included in net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the Commercial segment in 2004 was a strengthening of Gulf reserves, which was more than offset by favorable prior year reserve development in core Commercial operations due to reductions in the frequency of non catastrophe related losses. In 2003, unfavorable prior year loss development in the Commercial segment totaled $676 million, the most significant component of which was $521 million of reserve strengthening in the Gulf operations. That reserve strengthening was primarily related to a line of business that insured the residual values of leased vehicles and that had been placed in runoff in late 2001, and the resolution of a residual value claim dispute. Also included in claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 were catastrophe losses of $358 million, compared with catastrophe losses of $103 million in 2003. The losses in 2004 primarily resulted from the four hurricanes that made landfall in the southeastern United States in the third quarter, whereas the 2003 losses resulted from a variety of storms throughout the year, including Hurricane Isabel. Other items increasing 2004 claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $72 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables and policyholders receivables, previously described in the Consolidated Overview section. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2004 included a 13.6 point impact from prior year reserve development and a 4.1 point impact from catastrophe losses. In 2003, the impacts of these factors on the loss and loss expense ratio were 10.3 points and 1.6 points, respectively. Excluding those factors in both years, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio in 2004 of 62.3 was 1.2 points improved over the adjusted 2003 ratio of 63.5. The 3.3 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily reflected the impact of the higher underwriting expense ratio of the business acquired in the merger and operating expenses associated with Commercial other (where premium volume declined significantly). Operating income of $1.06 billion in 2003 was a significant improvement over the operating loss of $310 million in 2002. Operating results in 2003 reflected a favorable, but moderating, rate environment characterized by rate increases in excess of loss cost trends, and increased business volumes. After tax catastrophe losses totaled $67 million in 2003, whereas in 2002 the Commercial segment incurred no catastrophes. The 2002 operating loss was driven by significant asbestos related unfavorable prior year reserve development. Earned premiums in 2003 grew $721 million, or 12%, over 2002, primarily due to premium rate increases, growth in targeted new business and strong customer retention. The strong growth in 2003 earned premiums was partially offset by a $214 million decline in earned premiums at the Northland subsidiaries that resulted from the withdrawal in 2002 of business at American Equity Insurance Company and Commercial Guaranty Casualty Insurance Company. Net investment income in 2003 increased $17 million over 2002 due to higher average invested assets resulting from strong cash flows from operations, partially offset by the reduction in average pretax investment yields to 5.3% in 2003 from 6.0% in 2002. The decrease in yields reflected the lower interest rate environment, the shortening of the average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, a higher proportion of tax exempt investments and reduced returns in the Companys private equity investments; partially offset by higher returns in arbitrage fund investments. The $99 million, or 22%, increase in fee income in 2003 over 2002 reflected higher new business levels, price increases and more workers compensation business being written by state residual market pools. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2003 decreased $2.23 billion, or 30%, primarily due to a significant decline in unfavorable prior year reserve development, which was partially offset by an increase in catastrophe losses and increased loss costs resulting from growth in business volume. Catastrophe losses totaled $103 million in 2003, compared with no catastrophe losses in 2002. Catastrophe losses in 2003 were primarily the result of a severe winter storm in Colorado in the first quarter, severe storms in the second quarter in a number of Southern and Midwestern states and Hurricane Isabel in the third quarter. Unfavorable prior year reserve development included in claims and claim adjustment expenses was $676 million in 2003 compared to $3.12 billion in 2002. The most significant component of 2003 prior year development was the Gulf reserve strengthening of $521 million referred to previously. In addition to the Gulf charges, unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2003 included charges associated with American Equity Insurance Company and an increase in environmental reserves. No asbestos related prior year reserve development was recorded in 2003. Unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2002 included $2.95 billion of asbestos related charges (prior to the benefit related to recoveries under the Citigroup indemnification agreement). For additional information see Asbestos Claims and Litigation. Separately, the Company strengthened its environmental reserves in the 2002 fourth quarter, which was mostly offset by reductions in its reserves for other general liability exposures. These actions were taken as a result of payment and settlement experience. In addition, in 2003 the Company strengthened prior year reserves for certain run off lines of business, including assumed reinsurance, and experienced favorable development in certain on going businesses. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased $82 million, or 9%, in 2003, reflecting higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increase in earned premiums. General and administrative expenses in 2003 increased $150 million, or 18%, over 2002, driven by business growth and higher commission expense that resulted from improved underwriting results. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The 33.9 point improvement in the 2003 GAAP loss and loss adjustment expense ratio over 2002 primarily resulted from lower unfavorable prior year reserve development. The prior year asbestos related charges in 2002 added 36.8 points to that years loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, whereas in 2003 no prior year asbestos related charges were incurred. The favorable impact of premium rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in 2003 was largely offset by the impact of catastrophe losses. No catastrophe losses were incurred in 2002. The 0.6 point decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the benefits of the favorable rate environment and higher fee income, largely offset by higher commissions that result from improved underwriting performance. Commercial net written premiums by market were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Commercial Accounts $ 4,211 $ 3,251 $ 3,151 Select Accounts 2,555 2,047 1,869 National Accounts 940 831 641 Total Commercial Core 7,706 6,129 5,661 Commercial Other 507 733 669 Total Commercial $ 8,213 $ 6,862 $ 6,330 Commercial net written premiums in 2004 increased $1.35 billion, or 20%, over 2003, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. Business retention rates remained strong and renewal price change increases moderated to the low single digit levels in 2004. New business volume declined, however, when compared with the combined new business volume of SPC and TPC in 2003, reflecting the increasingly competitive marketplace and the impact of higher premium flow in 2003 associated with several renewal rights transactions. Commercial Accounts premium volume of $4.21 billion in 2004 grew $960 million, or 30%, over 2003 volume of $3.25 billion, primarily due to the merger. Retention rates remained strong and renewal price change increases were essentially flat by the end of the year. New business levels moderated during the second half of 2004 as the benefit from the Atlantic Mutual and Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transactions completed in the third quarter of 2003 diminished in the second half of the year. Select Accounts 2004 premium volume of $2.56 billion increased $508 million, or 25%, over 2003, reflecting the impact of the merger. Overall retention rates were strong and renewal price increases moderated to the mid single digits. Retention and growth were strongest in smaller, high transaction volume accounts, reflecting the Companys competitive advantage in agency automation, product offerings and service to agents. The 13% increase in National Accounts premium volume in 2004 reflected new business from the third quarter 2003 Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction and higher business volumes in residual market pools, the impacts of which were partially offset by a shift to deductible and fee based products by some of the Companys clients. In the Commercial Other business, the $226 million, or 31%, decline in 2004 premium volume compared with 2003 primarily reflected the placement of Gulf operations in runoff in the second quarter of 2004. Subsequently, certain business previously written by Gulf is now being written in the Commercial or Specialty segments. The runoff healthcare, reinsurance and international business acquired in the merger produced minimal written premium volume in 2004. Commercial net written premiums increased $532 million, or 8%, in 2003. Renewal price increases, higher new business levels, and strong customer retention across all major lines of business combined to drive premium growth over 2002. This premium growth was partially offset by the decrease in net written premiums at the Northland subsidiaries due to the withdrawal in 2002 of business at certain of those subsidiaries and a one time 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements additional $115 million of net written premium in 2002 related to the termination of certain reinsurance contracts. Net written premiums for the Northland subsidiaries were $547 million in 2003 compared to $825 million in 2002. The Commercial business of those subsidiaries is included with Commercial Accounts. Commercial Accounts net written premiums increased $100 million, or 3%, in 2003. Net written premiums associated with the Northland subsidiaries declined to $547 million in 2003 from $825 million in 2002 due to the factors described above. Excluding the Northland subsidiaries net written premiums in both 2003 and 2002, Commercial Accounts premium volume in 2003 grew 16% over 2002. The increase was primarily due to renewal price increases, new business growth in targeted markets and strong retention across all major product lines. Select Accounts net written premiums in 2003 increased $178 million, or 10%, over 2002. The increase primarily reflected renewal price increases, new business and strong retention. New business growth was especially strong in property, general liability and commercial multi peril lines of business. Select Accounts retention levels in 2003 were strongest for small commercial business handled through the Companys Service Centers, while premium growth was centered in the commercial multi peril and property product lines. National Accounts net written premiums in 2003 increased $190 million, or 30%, over 2002, primarily due to the continued benefit from rate increases, higher new business levels that, in part, resulted from the Companys third quarter 2003 renewal rights transaction with Royal & SunAlliance and higher business volume in residual market pools. The Commercial Other sector of the Commercial segment in 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of results from the Companys Gulf subsidiary, which marketed products to national, mid sized and small customers and distributed them through both wholesale brokers and retail agents and brokers throughout the United States with particular emphasis on management and professional liability coverages and excess and surplus lines of insurance. Gulf net written premiums increased $83 million, or 14%, in 2003 as a result of significant rate increases across all classes of management liability products. Specialty The Specialty segments results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 reflect the results of TPCs Bond and Construction operations for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the post merger combined results of SPCs specialty operations and TPCs Bond and Construction operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Results for 2003 and 2002 represent TPCs Bond and Construction operations only. (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Earned premiums $ 4,791 $ 1,171 $ 970 Net investment income 507 183 188 Fee income 26 15 9 Other revenues 22 8 5 Total revenues $ 5,346 $ 1,377 $ 1,172 Total claims and expenses $ 6,517 $ 1,048 $ 915 Operating income (loss) $ (724 ) $ 234 $ 184 Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 102.8 % 51.3 % 53.5 % Underwriting expense ratio 32.6 36.0 39.1 GAAP combined ratio 135.4 % 87.3 % 92.6 % The operating loss of $724 million in 2004 was driven by after tax unfavorable prior year reserve development of $1.03 billion ($1.59 billion, pretax) including $500 million and $300 million (pretax) of net unfavorable prior year loss development related to the construction and surety reserves, respectively, acquired in 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the merger as well as other net reserving actions that are described in the narrative that follows. In June 2004, the Company decided to commute certain reinsurance agreements with a major reinsurer, resulting in a prior year reserve charge of $75 million. Operating results in 2004 also included $155 million of after tax catastrophe losses resulting from the four hurricanes described previously, whereas 2003 results included no catastrophe losses. Domestic Specialty earned premiums totaled $3.86 billion in 2004, compared with $1.17 billion in 2003. International Specialty earned premiums in 2004 were $930 million, whereas 2003 results included minimal international premiums. The increases over 2003 were primarily driven by incremental premiums resulting from the merger, and also reflected the impact of price increases. Net investment income increased $324 million over 2003 due to the increase in invested assets as a result of the merger. In addition, strong operational cash flows contributed to the growth in invested assets over the same period of 2003. Also impacting in net investment income is the effect of a decline in pretax investment yields due to a higher proportion of tax exempt investments and lower yields on fixed income securities and alternative investments. The following discussion provides more information regarding the net unfavorable prior year loss development related to the construction and surety reserves, acquired in the merger as well as other net reserving actions. Construction Reserves Beginning on April 1, 2004, upon the completion of the merger of TPC and SPC, personnel from the predecessor companies were able to share detailed policyholder information, claim files and actuarial data related to the acquired construction reserves. This enabled an analysis to be performed in the second quarter of the acquired construction reserves using TPCs long established practices that includes evaluating exposures by type of claim (e.g. construction defect, construction wrap up, other), by type of coverage, (e.g. guaranteed cost, loss responsive, other) and by detailed line of business (general liability, commercial auto, etc.), among others. For general liability exposures, which include construction defect and construction wrap up, interpretation of underlying trends (both present and future) and the related reserve estimation process is highly judgmental due to the low frequency/high severity and complex nature of these exposures. In particular, for construction defect, there is a high degree of uncertainty relating to whether coverage exists, when losses occur, the size of each loss, expectations for future interpretive rulings concerning contract provisions and the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. As a result, material variations can and do occur among actuarial reserve estimates for these types of exposures. In a merger, these differences are likely to be even more pronounced. Prior to a merger, each legacy company consistently applies its assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods to estimate reserves. Differences between these assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods need to be understood and reconciled, and a uniform approach needs to be adopted for the merged entity. In this situation, material adjustments can and do occur for reserves related to exposures having a high degree of uncertainty. Analysis of the acquired construction reserves was completed near the end of the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the results of this analysis, the Company increased its estimate of the acquired net construction reserves by $500 million, including $400 million for construction defect and $100 million for construction wrap up claims, and recognized this change in estimate as an income statement charge in the second quarter. There was no reinsurance associated with this charge. Surety Reserves Beginning on April 1, 2004, upon completion of the merger of TPC and SPC, personnel from the predecessor companies were able to share the detailed SPC policyholder information, including underwriting, claim and actuarial files related to surety reserves. Access to this detailed information enabled the Company to perform a claim by claim review of reserves and claims handling strategies during the second quarter of 2004 using the combined expertise of claims adjusters from the legacy companies. This type of review involves considerable judgment, especially with respect to the economic outlook within which claims will be settled, 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements estimates for dates of loss occurrence and evaluations of IBNR exposures for each insured. For example, as a result of the detailed information obtained concerning contractors with reported claims, the Company considered whether or not losses were incurred but not yet reported on one or more additional projects for each contractor examined. Also on April 1, 2004, the Company could begin to use this detailed information to compare SPCs assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods that were underlying the acquired reserves with its own assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods. Similarities and differences were found to exist. Similarities included, but were not limited to, recognizing claim reserves when it was determined that contractors and commercial surety insureds were in default and thereby unable to meet their obligations, estimating initial IBNR provisions, and periodically re evaluating, at least quarterly, the adequacy of the reserves established based on actual claims recorded and revised estimates of IBNR. Differences included judgments and methods related to determining IBNR development factors and expected salvage, among others. That these differences exist is not unusual for surety reserve estimates. Surety is a line of business for which there are low frequency, high severity, very complex claims for certain exposures, particularly those related to large construction contractors and commercial surety insureds. Determining the date of loss in these circumstances requires a high degree of judgment. In addition, the claim reserve estimates even for reported claims are also highly judgmental. These two factors, among others, combine to make IBNR reserve estimations for surety extremely difficult. Due to this high degree of uncertainty, the informed judgments of different actuaries could and do vary materially. As discussed above, in a merger, these differences are likely to be even more pronounced. The claim reviews and actuarial analyses were both completed near the end of the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the results of these reviews and analyses, the Company increased its estimate of the acquired net surety reserves by $300 million, net of $170 million of reinsurance, and recognized this change in estimate as an income statement charge in the second quarter. Prior to the merger and beginning in the third quarter of 2003, SPC disclosed that a large construction contractor for which it had written several surety bonds was experiencing financial difficulty. Based upon an analysis of the financial condition of the construction contractor that was performed in the third quarter of 2003, a restructuring plan was adopted by the construction contractor, its banks, and SPC, among others, as a means to minimize estimated losses. SPC monitored the progress of the construction contractor toward meeting the requirements of the restructuring plan throughout subsequent quarters. SPC also estimated and disclosed its estimated ultimate net losses related to this exposure, beginning in the third quarter of 2003 and updated each quarter thereafter, including the effects of advances made or expected to be made to the construction contractor, applicable collateral, co surety participations and reinsurance. The size and complexity of these particular construction contracts, coupled with the deteriorating credit quality of the construction contractor and the inherent uncertainty as to whether it would meet the obligations of the restructuring plan, resulted in a high degree of judgment in estimating potential losses. A comprehensive analysis that began in the first quarter of 2004 was completed during the last half of the second quarter. Based upon this analysis, the Company concluded that the contractor would not be able to meet the targets set forth in its business and restructuring plans. Therefore, the Company moved from supporting the contractors restructuring plan to adopting a workout plan as a means to minimize estimated losses. Under the workout plan, the Company would no longer provide additional surety bonds for new projects of the construction contractor. Also as part of the workout plan, the Company was able to implement additional accounting and engineering procedures for each open project, which included using specialists to implement additional forecasting, cash management, and reporting procedures, on both a project by project and consolidated level. Based upon this second quarter change to a workout plan and the detailed financial analysis that was able to be performed, the Company increased its estimate of the ultimate net loss by $252 million, including $9 million of reinsurance. This estimate took into consideration paid amounts, net receivables, liquidated damages, overhead 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements costs, additional completion costs, including costs associated with replacing the contractor, receivable discounts, current and future claims from owners and subcontractors against the contractor, and the value of collateral, among others. Also during the last half of the second quarter of 2004, a participating co surety on this exposure announced that insurance regulators had approved its submitted run off plan. Based upon industrys knowledge of the co suretys run off plan and the Companys analysis of its financial condition, the Company concluded that it was unlikely to collect the full amount projected to be owed by the co surety and established an appropriate level of reserves. Claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 included $225 million of catastrophe losses, compared with no such losses in 2003. Results in 2004 also reflected increased current year loss provisions on portions of the Bond and Construction books of business, and $150 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development recorded in TPCs Construction operation prior to the merger. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the majority of the remaining markets comprising this segment recorded strong underwriting results, driven by favorable current year loss experience. Other items increasing 2004 claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $224 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables, policyholders receivables, and a co surety on a specific construction contractor claim previously described in the Consolidated Overview section. The combined ratio in 2004 included a 33.1 point impact of unfavorable prior year reserve development and a 4.8 impact of catastrophe losses. The impact of both items in 2003 was negligible. The $50 million increase in operating earnings in 2003 over 2002 reflected strong results from the Companys Bond operation. The $201 million, or 21%, increase in earned premiums over 2002 primarily resulted from premium rate increases, growth in targeted new business and strong customer retention. The $5 million decline in net investment income in 2003 primarily reflected a reduction in pretax investment yields from 6.0% in 2002 to 5.3% in 2003. Claims and expenses in 2003 included unfavorable prior year reserve development totaling $12 million, compared with unfavorable development of $3 million in 2002. The 5.3 point improvement in the combined ratio in 2003 reflected the impact of price increases, higher new business volumes and controlled expense growth. Specialty net written premiums by market were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Bond $ 1,136 $ 781 $ 630 Construction 846 474 408 Financial and Professional Services 631 Other 1,287 Total Domestic Specialty 3,900 1,255 1,038 International Specialty 894 3 2 Total Specialty $ 4,794 $ 1,258 $ 1,040 The $3.54 billion increase in net written premium volume over 2003 reflected the impact of the merger. However, the repositioning of the Bond and Construction books of business primarily accounted for a decline in net written premium volume in 2004 compared with the 2003 combined premium volume of SPC and TPC. In Construction, that repositioning resulted in reduced retention levels when compared with 2003, and new business 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements levels also declined substantially. In Bond, the repositioning of the book of business was primarily centered in the SPC business acquired in the merger. Net written premiums in 2004 in the majority of the Companys remaining domestic specialty businesses were strong, with retention levels at or above historical levels. The Company continued to focus on retaining the profitable and well priced book of business that has been built in recent years. Renewal price change increases in these operations moderated throughout the year to the upper single digit level. New business levels in 2004 were down compared with 2003, when renewal rights transactions contributed to strong growth in new business. The impact of the decline in new business levels in 2004 was partially offset by premium growth resulting from the transfer of certain business from the Companys Gulf operation, which was placed in runoff in the second quarter of the year. In addition, premium volume in these domestic businesses benefited in 2004 from a small amount of additional transfers of certain business previously written in the Commercial segments commercial accounts operation. In International Specialty, acquired in the merger, business retention levels (excluding Lloyds) were strong relative to pre merger levels. New business levels were consistent with 2003, while the rate of renewal price change increases moderated to the low single digit levels. The Company continued to focus on retaining its profitable book of existing international specialty business. At Lloyds, premium volume was negatively impacted by the planned non renewal of certain personal lines insurance coverages. The $218 million, or 21%, increase in net written premiums in 2003 over 2002 reflected a favorable premium rate environment and strong new business, particularly in Bonds executive liability lines. Personal Results of the Companys Personal segment were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Earned premiums $ 5,580 $ 4,822 $ 4,354 Net investment income 442 361 385 Other revenues 91 85 80 Total revenues $ 6,113 $ 5,268 $ 4,819 Total claims and expenses $ 4,732 $ 4,555 $ 4,329 Operating income $ 939 $ 492 $ 347 Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 58.3 % 69.1 % 73.6 % Underwriting expense ratio 24.9 23.7 24.0 GAAP combined ratio 83.2 % 92.8 % 97.6 % Operating income of $939 million in 2004 increased $447 million over 2003. The significant improvement in 2004 was driven by historically low loss frequency levels, particularly in the property line, after tax favorable prior year reserve development of $246 million, an increase in investment income, and strong premium growth reflecting the impact of unit growth and price increases. The $758 million, or 16%, growth in earned premiums over 2003 was primarily due to an increase in organic new business volume, new business associated with the Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction completed in the third quarter of 2003, continued strong business retention levels and renewal price increases. Net investment income in 2004 grew 22% over 2003, driven by strong operational cash flows during the year that contributed to a significant growth in invested assets since the end of 2003. In addition, net investment income in 2004 benefited from $39 million of income resulting from the initial public trading of an investment in the first 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements quarter of the year. Also impacting net investment income in 2004 was the effect of a decline in pretax investment yields resulting from a higher proportion of tax exempt investments, and generally lower yields on fixed income securities purchased during the year. Claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 included $378 million of favorable prior year reserve development, primarily driven by a decline in the frequency of non catastrophe related homeowners losses, as well as an improvement in the frequency and severity trends in the automobile line of business. In 2003, favorable prior year reserve development totaled $212 million, also primarily due to a decline in the frequency of non catastrophe related homeowners losses. The 2003 total included a $50 million reduction in the provision for losses resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. In addition, claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 reflected the benefit of lower current accident year frequency of non catastrophe claims in the homeowners line of business than in 2003. Claims and expenses in 2004 included catastrophe losses of $189 million, compared with catastrophe losses of $249 million in 2003. The 2004 losses were primarily the result of the four hurricanes described previously, whereas the 2003 losses resulted from a variety of storms across the United States, including Hurricane Isabel in the third quarter of the year and wildfires in California. Claims and expenses in 2004 also reflected continued investments in process re engineering pilots targeted to improve loss severity. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $941 million in 2004, an 18% increase over the 2003 total of $800 million. The increase was due to higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increases in earned premium previously described, as well as a change in product mix. General and administrative expenses of $536 million in 2004 were 28% higher than comparable expenses of $420 million in 2003, primarily due to business growth, higher commission expense related to improved underwriting results and investments in personnel, technology and infrastructure to support business growth and product development. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2004 reflected a 6.8 point favorable impact from prior year reserve development, compared with a favorable prior year impact of 4.4 points on the 2003 ratio. Catastrophe losses accounted for 3.4 points and 5.2 points of the 2004 and 2003 ratios, respectively. In addition to these factors, the significant improvement in the 2004 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio reflected the earned impact of price increases that continued to exceed loss cost trends. The 1.2 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio reflected the investments described previously, as well as the impact of higher commission expenses related to improved underwriting results. Operating income in 2003 increased $145 million, or 42%, over 2002. Operating income in 2003 benefited from a favorable, but moderating, premium rate environment in both automobile and property, increased business volumes and a continued moderation in the increase in loss costs. Earned premiums increased $468 million, or 11%, in 2003, primarily due to higher rates, growth in new business volumes and strong retention levels. Net investment income in 2003 decreased $24 million compared with 2002, despite an increase in average invested assets resulting from strong operational cash flows. The decline resulted from a reduction in pretax investment yields, which reflected a lower interest rate environment, the shortening of the average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, a higher proportion of tax exempt investments and slightly lower returns from the Companys private equity investments. Claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2003 included favorable prior year reserve development of $212 million, compared with favorable development of $30 million in 2002. The favorable development in 2003 resulted from improvement in non catastrophe related claim frequency for both homeowners and non bodily injury automobile businesses, and a $50 million reduction in reserves related to the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 (also due to lower than expected claim frequency). Catastrophe losses of $249 million in 2003 were significantly higher than comparable losses of $84 million in 2002. Catastrophe losses in both years were driven by numerous storms across the United States. Losses in 2003 also reflected the impact of Hurricane Isabel and wildfires in California. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which totaled $800 million in 2003, increased $63 million, or 9%, over 2002 due to higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increases in earned premium previously described. General and administrative expenses in 2003 also increased 9% over 2002, driven by business growth and higher commissions that resulted from improved underwriting results. The 4.5 point improvement in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio over 2002 was due to renewal price increases that exceeded loss cost trends, continued reduced levels of non catastrophe property claim frequency and higher favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher catastrophes. Personal net written premiums by product line were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Automobile $ 3,433 $ 3,054 $ 2,843 Homeowners and other 2,496 2,027 1,732 Total $ 5,929 $ 5,081 $ 4,575 Net written premiums in 2004 increased 17% over 2003. Both Automobile and Homeowners and other net written premiums increased in 2004 due to higher organic new business volumes, the impact of new business associated with the Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction completed in the third quarter of 2003, continued strong retention, and renewal price increases. The Personal segment had approximately 6.1 million, 5.4 million and 5.2 million policies in force at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the Automobile line of business, policies in force at December 31, 2004 increased 9% over 2003. Policies in force in the Homeowners and other line of business at December 31, 3004 increased by 15% over 2003. Effective in the first quarter of 2004, Homeowners and other policies in force exclude certain endorsements to Homeowners policies previously considered separate policies in force. Policy totals for 2003 and 2002 were restated to conform to the 2004 presentation. Automobile net written premiums in 2003 increased $211 million, or 7%, over 2002 due to higher business volumes and renewal price increases. Policies in force at December 31, 2003 increased 4% over 2002. Homeowners and Other net written premiums increased $295 million, or 17%, in 2003 due to higher business volumes and renewal price increases. Policies in force increased 6% in 2003. Asset Management Nuveen Investments key financial data were as follows: (for the nine months ended December 31, in millions) 2004 Revenues $ 390 Expenses 199 Pretax income, as reported by Nuveen Investments 191 Net amortization of the fair value adjustment to intangibles 9 Pretax income, before minority interest $ 182 Asset Management net income, net of minority interest $ 88 Assets under management $ 115,453 Nuveen Investments total revenues of $390 million in 2004, from the SPC and TPC merger date, were driven by continued strong growth in assets under management. Gross sales of investment products totaled $19.86 billion, consisting of $16.76 billion of retail and institutional managed accounts, $1.87 billion of closed 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements end exchange traded funds and $1.23 billion of mutual funds. Nuveen Investments positive net flows (equal to the sum of sales, reinvestments and exchanges, less redemptions) totaled $11.23 billion during the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Net flows were positive across all product lines in 2004. Assets under management grew by $14.53 billion, or 14.4%, since the merger date, driven by the positive net flows and market appreciation during that period. Assets under management at December 31, 2004 were comprised of $50.21 billion of exchange traded funds, $36.98 billion of retail managed accounts, $15.58 billion of institutional managed accounts, and $12.68 billion of mutual funds. Investment advisory fees accounted for 93% of Nuveen Investments revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Interest Expense and Other (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 14 $ 2 $ 1 Net after tax expense $ (182 ) $ (112 ) $ (103 ) Net after tax expense for Interest Expense and Other for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $70 million compared with 2003, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. Included in the increase was $46 million of incremental interest expense on debt assumed in the merger. That amount was net of the favorable impact of $36 million of the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to debt recorded at the acquisition date. The 2004 total also included $9 million of charges related to the merger that were recorded in the second quarter. Interest Expense and Other in 2003 increased $9 million, after tax, primarily due to higher interest costs. After tax interest expense was $105 million in 2003 compared to $100 million in 2002. The increase in interest expense in 2003 was primarily due to certain one time costs associated with the first and second quarter refinancing activities that lowered average interest costs, but resulted in higher levels of temporary debt. Temporary financing included $550 million first obtained in December 2002 in connection with the fourth quarter 2002 asbestos reserve strengthening and $1.40 billion of senior notes issued on March 11, 2003. The proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used to prepay and refinance a $500 million note to Citigroup on March 11, 2003, and to redeem $900 million of trust preferred securities on April 9, 2003. For additional information see Liquidity and Capital Resources. ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have attempted to expand insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the intent of insurers and policyholders. As a result, the Company continues to experience a significant number of asbestos claims being tendered to the Company by the Companys policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy) including claims against the Companys policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure. Factors underlying these increases include more intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants, the increasing focus by plaintiffs on new and previously peripheral defendants and entities seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities. In addition to contributing to the increase in claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. Bankruptcy proceedings are also causing increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system. Recently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation have their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. This trend, along with the focus on new and previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the increase in loss and loss expense payments experienced by the Company. In addition, the Company sees, as an emerging trend, an increase in the Companys asbestos related 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements loss and loss expense experience as a result of the exhaustion or unavailability due to insolvency of other insurance potentially available to policyholders along with the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants. The Company is currently involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders who have filed for bankruptcy, including, among others, ACandS, Inc., who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage as described generally in the next paragraph. (Also see Part I Item 3, Legal Proceedings). These trends are expected to continue through 2005. As a result of the factors described above, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims. In some instances, policyholders continue to assert that their claims for asbestos related insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage and that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues or whether the Company will be successful in asserting additional defenses. To the extent both issues are resolved in policyholders favor and other additional Company defenses are not successful, the Companys coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict the ultimate cost of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. In addition, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, challenging insurers conduct in respect of asbestos claims, and, as discussed below, claims by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos related bodily injuries. The Company anticipates the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, TPC has entered into settlement agreements, which have been approved by the court in connection with the proceedings initiated by TPC in the Johns Manville bankruptcy court. If the rulings of the bankruptcy court are affirmed through the appellate process, then TPC will have resolved substantially all of the pending claims against it of this nature. (Also, see Item 3 Legal Proceedings). Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder on a policyholder by policyholder basis. In the course of this evaluation, the Company considers: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of each policyholders potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non asbestos claims or potential non asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. When the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and related claim adjustment expense is determined for a policyholder, the Company calculates, by each policy year, a ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, past ceded experience and reinsurance collections. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves. The Companys evaluations have not resulted in any data from which a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment may be determined. The Company also compares its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Net asbestos 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements losses and expenses paid in 2004 were $301 million, compared with $452 million in 2003. Approximately 22% in 2004 and 57% in 2003 of total net paid losses relate to policyholders with whom the Company previously entered into settlement agreements that would limit the Companys liability. The decrease in the percentage of net paid settlements to total paid losses in 2004 primarily reflected an increase in reinsurance billings in 2004, which related to gross payments made in prior periods. In 2004, gross payments associated with policyholders with settlement agreements totaled $199 million, compared with $289 million in 2003. At December 31, 2004, net asbestos reserves totaled $3.93 billion, compared with $2.98 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company acquired $311 million of net asbestos reserves in the merger with SPC. Net incurred asbestos losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $928 million in 2004, driven by a $922 million provision to strengthen reserves in the fourth quarter following completion of the Companys annual ground up review of asbestos exposures. That review included an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, state judicial rulings and legislative actions. The $922 million provision primarily resulted from an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants. The Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows (the increase in policyholders in 2004 reflected the acquisition of SPC): Number ofPolicyholders Total Paid (1) AsbestosReserves (2) (at and for the year ended December 31, $ in millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Policyholders with settlement agreements 29 23 $ 67 $ 257 $ 1,431 $ 826 Other policyholders with active claims: Home office review 597 312 202 172 1,339 669 Field office review 1,324 880 8 8 81 102 Assumed reinsurance and International (3) 24 15 526 230 Unallocated IBNR 555 1,150 Total 1,950 1,215 $ 301 $ 452 $ 3,932 $ 2,977 (1) Net of reinsurance recoveries (2) Net of reinsurance recoverable (3) Data for 2004 includes international exposures acquired in merger The policyholders with settlement agreements category includes structured agreements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts and the settlement of the Statutory and Hawaii Actions and the Common Law Claims (for a fuller description of these matters, see Item 3 Legal Proceedings) (collectively the Direct Action Settlement). Reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured agreements are arrangements under which policyholders and or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. Structured agreements include the Companys obligations related to PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG). In May 2002 the Company agreed along with approximately three dozen other insurers and PPG on key terms to settle asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG. This settlement is to be incorporated into the Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) proposed as part of the Pittsburgh Corning (PC) bankruptcy proceeding. There remain a number of contingencies to consummation of the settlement including the final execution of documents, court approval of the PC Plan over pending objections, approval of the settlement and possible appeals. Pursuant to the proposed PC Plan, PC along with enumerated affiliated companies (including PPG and Corning) are to receive the protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos related bodily injury claims. A recent ruling by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in the In Re Combustion Engineering, Inc. (CE) matter may impact the scope of relief that is potentially available to the debtor and other Plan proponents. As a result, the PC bankruptcy court has sought additional briefing on the impact of the CE decision on the proposed 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements PC Plan. Oral argument is scheduled to take place on March 16, 2005. The Company cannot predict what effect the CE decision may have with respect to the bankruptcy courts approval of the current Plan. The Company believes that completion of the settlement is reasonably likely although it is not possible to predict how or when the bankruptcy court will rule on the outstanding objections or how an appellate court may rule in the event of an appeal. It is possible that the Companys single payment contribution pursuant to the proposed settlement of approximately $395 million after reinsurance will be made in calendar year 2005. Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with major policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. As more fully described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, TPC has entered into the Direct Action Settlement which is still subject to a number of contingencies. If those contingencies are met, then TPC will pay up to $502 million, possibly in calendar year 2005. One of the contingencies includes affirmance by all appellate courts of the orders entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Direct Action Settlement. It is not possible to predict how or when the appellate courts will rule on the pending appeals. Ten new policyholders were added to the policyholders with settlement agreements category during 2004, including seven resulting from the acquisition of SPC. During the course of 2004, the Company made final payments to four policyholders, including one that arose during the year. Other policyholders with active claims are identified as home office review or field office review policyholders. Policyholders are identified for home office review based upon, among other factors: aggregate ultimate expected payments in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential non product exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. During 2004, there were 285 policyholders added to the home office review. The acquisition of SPC accounted for 222 of those policyholders, while the TPC count increased by 63. Paid losses for policyholders in the home office review category increased by $30 million during the year, primarily due to the addition of the SPC policyholders to this category. Accounts under field office review increased by 444 policyholders over year end 2003. The acquisition of SPC accounted for 516 of those policyholders, while the TPC count was reduced by 72. Assumed reinsurance exposure primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations. The Companys international operations are exposed to U.S. asbestos liabilities through participations in excess insurance policies, quota share and excess of loss reinsurance policies, and retrocession policies, underwritten in the London insurance market. Details of exposures under the reinsurance and retrocession policies are identified only when the Company is advised by the retrocedant. In addition to incurred but not reported (IBNR), amounts contained in the reserves for specific policyholders or groups of policyholders described above, the Company has established an unallocated IBNR reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders, new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation and direct actions against the Company. During 2004, reclassification of reserves to Policyholders with settlement agreements resulted in a reduction in the unallocated IBNR reserve of $595 million. The Direct Action Settlement accounted for $502 million of this reclassification. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves: (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Beginning reserves: Direct $ 3,782 $ 4,287 $ 1,046 Ceded (805 ) (883 ) (226 ) Net 2,977 3,404 820 Reserves acquired: Direct 502 Ceded (191 ) Net 311 Incurred losses and loss expenses: Direct (1) 941 3,660 Ceded (13 ) (715 ) Net 928 2,945 Accretion of discount: Direct 17 25 Ceded Net 17 25 Losses paid: Direct 467 530 419 Ceded (166 ) (78 ) (58 ) Net 301 452 361 Ending reserves: Direct 4,775 3,782 4,287 Ceded (843 ) (805 ) (883 ) Net $ 3,932 $ 2,977 $ 3,404 (1) Includes $800 million related to incurred asbestos losses subject to the Citigroup indemnification agreement in 2002. See Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION The Company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several with other responsible parties. The Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid 1970s. These decisions continue 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount. At December 31, 2004, approximately 71% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $456 million) is carried in a bulk reserve and includes unresolved and incurred but not reported environmental claims for which the Company has not received any specific claims as well as for the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The balance, approximately 29% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $185 million), consists of case reserves. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in process environmental claims and the Companys experience in resolving those claims. The resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder by policyholder basis as opposed to a claim by claim basis. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy back of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any future liability arising from known specified sites or claims. Provisions of these agreements also include appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Companys general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Companys potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs. In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the allegations of environmental harm at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non environmental claims or potential non environmental claims, in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves. There have been judicial interpretations that, in some cases, have been unfavorable to the industry and the Company. Additionally, payments for loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses have increased over past years. In its review of environmental reserves, the Company considered: the adequacy of reserves for past settlements; changing judicial and legislative trends; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean up action for both on and off site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development and additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements. Based on these trends, developments and management judgment, the Company increased its IBNR reserves accordingly. In 2004, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $290 million, net of reinsurance, to increase environmental reserves due to revised estimates of costs related to recent settlement initiatives. The duration of the Companys investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim to claim and policyholder by policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. However, based upon the Companys experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years. The Companys review of policyholders tendering claims for the first time has indicated that they are lower in severity. These policyholders generally present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, regulatory agencies are utilizing risk based analysis and more efficient clean up technologies. However, the Company has experienced an increase in the anticipated settlement amounts of certain matters as well as an increase in loss adjustment expenses. The following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Beginning reserves: Direct $ 331 $ 448 $ 479 Ceded (41 ) (62 ) (83 ) Net 290 386 396 Reserves acquired: Direct 271 Ceded (58 ) Net 213 Incurred losses and loss expenses: Direct 323 59 154 Ceded (33 ) (3 ) Net 290 59 151 Losses paid: Direct 200 176 185 Ceded (48 ) (21 ) (24 ) Net 152 155 161 Ending reserves: Direct 725 331 448 Ceded (84 ) (41 ) (62 ) Net $ 641 $ 290 $ 386 UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES As a result of the processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at December 31, 2004 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and managements judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos claims in a manner inconsistent with 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the Companys previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company and future developments pertaining to the Companys ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims. In addition, the Company sees, as an emerging trend, an increase in the Companys asbestos related loss and loss expense experience as a result of the exhaustion or unavailability due to insolvency of other insurance potentially available to policyholders along with the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of large coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos reserves, which includes an annual ground up review of asbestos policyholders, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. The Company completed the annual ground up review, which included the asbestos liabilities acquired in the merger, during the fourth quarter of 2004. Also see Item 3 Legal Proceedings. Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. In addition, the Companys estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Companys operating results and financial condition in future periods. INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO The Companys invested assets at December 31, 2004 totaled $64.71 billion, including $477 million of securities in process of settlement, of which 92% was invested in fixed maturity and short term investments, 1% in common stocks and other equity securities, 1% in mortgage loans and real estate and 6% in other investments. Excluding the impact on invested assets of securities lending, unrealized investment gains and losses, receivables for investment sales and payables on investment purchases, the pretax average yield was 4.8%, 5.3% and 6.0% and the after tax average yield was 3.7%, 4.0% and 4.4% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a conservative investment philosophy. The Companys fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2004 totaled $54.26 billion, comprising $53.93 billion of publicly traded fixed maturities and $328 million of private fixed maturities. The weighted average quality ratings of the Companys publicly traded fixed maturity portfolio and private fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2004 were AA2 and A3, respectively. Included in the fixed maturity portfolio at that date was approximately $1.78 billion of below investment grade securities. During 2004, holdings of tax exempt securities were increased to $26.58 billion to take advantage of their relatively high credit quality and attractive after tax yields. The average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short term investments, was 4.1 years as of December 31, 2004 (4.4 years excluding short term investments), unchanged from December 31, 2003. 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table sets forth the Companys combined fixed maturity investment portfolio classified by Moodys Investors Service ratings: (at December 31, 2004, in millions) Carrying Value Percent of TotalCarrying Value Quality Rating: Aaa $ 32,656 60.2 % Aa 11,081 20.4 A 4,931 9.1 Baa 3,810 7.0 Total investment grade 52,478 96.7 Non investment grade 1,778 3.3 Total fixed maturity investments $ 54,256 100.0 % The Company makes investments in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) that typically have high credit quality, offer good liquidity, and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to U.S. Treasury securities. The Companys investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved. One significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity. While prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration) and its effect on total return cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company does invest in other types of CMO tranches if a careful assessment indicates a favorable risk/return tradeoff. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company held CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $3.30 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively (excluding Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities of $953 million and $875 million, respectively). Approximately 53% and 60% of the Companys CMO holdings are guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, the Company held $4.66 billion and $3.80 billion of GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC or FHA mortgage backed pass through securities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Virtually all of these securities are rated Aaa. The Companys other investments are primarily comprised of venture capital, through direct ownership and limited partnerships, private equity limited partnerships, joint ventures, other limited partnerships and trading securities, which are subject to more volatility than the Companys fixed income investments, but historically have provided a higher return. At December 31, 2004, the carrying value of the Companys other investments was $3.56 billion. Impairment charges included in net realized investment gains (losses) were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Fixed maturities $ 25 $ 65 $ 255 Equity securities 5 6 8 Venture capital 40 Real estate and other 10 19 21 Total $ 80 $ 90 $ 284 For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized the following other than temporary impairments: $25 million in the fixed income portfolio related to various issuers with credit risk associated with the issuers deteriorated financial position. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $5 million in the equity portfolio when it became apparent that the cost basis of those securities would not be recovered over the expected holding period. $40 million in its venture capital portfolio on 16 holdings. Three of the holdings were impaired due to new financings at less than favorable rates. Five holdings experienced fundamental economic deterioration (characterized by less than expected revenues or a fundamental change in product). Eight of the holdings were impaired due to the impending sale, liquidation or shutdown of the entity. The Company continues to evaluate current developments in the market that have the potential to affect the valuation of the Companys investments. $10 million in its real estate and other holdings. The losses recorded were the result of falling rental rates and occupancies in three of the Companys real estate investment holdings. The Company recognized other than temporary impairments of $65 million in the fixed income portfolio during 2003 related to various issuers, with $8 million due to companies filing bankruptcy and the remainder related to credit risk associated with the issuers deteriorated financial position. For publicly traded securities, the amounts of the impairments were recognized by writing down the investments to quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, impairments are recognized by writing down the investment to its estimated fair value, as determined during the Companys quarterly internal review process. The specific circumstances that led to the impairments described above did not materially impact other individual investments held during 2004 or 2003. The following table summarizes for all fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale and for equity securities reported at fair value for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost at December 31, 2004, the gross unrealized investment loss by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position: Period For Which Fair Value Is Less Than 80% of Amortized Cost (in millions) Less Than 3Months Greater Than 3Months, LessThan 6 Months Greater Than 6Months, LessThan 12 Months Greater Than12 Months Total Fixed maturities $ $ $ $ $ Equity securities Venture capital 1 1 7 9 Total $ 1 $ 1 $ 7 $ $ 9 The Company believes that the prices of the securities identified above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of market dislocation and generally poor cyclical economic conditions. Further, unrealized losses as of December 31, 2004 represent less than 1% of the portfolio, and, therefore, any impact on the Companys financial position would not be significant. At December 31, 2004, non investment grade securities comprised 3% of the Companys fixed income investment portfolio. Included in those categories at December 31, 2004 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $321 million and a fair value of $314 million, resulting in a net pretax unrealized loss of $7 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of the total amortized cost and less than 1% of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2004, and accounted for 3% of the total pretax unrealized loss in the fixed income portfolio. 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Following are the pretax realized losses on investments sold during the year ended December 31, 2004: (in millions) Loss Fair Value Fixed maturities $ 131 $ 4,264 Equity securities 8 63 Other 28 230 Total $ 167 $ 4,557 Resulting purchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Companys ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations. OUTLOOK The Companys strategic objective is to enhance its position as a consistently profitable market leader and a cost effective provider of property and casualty insurance in the United States. A variety of factors continue to affect the property and casualty insurance market and the Companys core business outlook for 2005, including the moderating level of price increases in the commercial marketplace, the increasing competitive environment across all of the Companys businesses, loss cost trends (including medical inflation and auto loss costs), asbestos related developments and rising reinsurance and litigation costs. The Company expects market conditions in the property casualty insurance sector to continue to be quite competitive throughout 2005. Commercial pricing at the end of 2004 had declined to the low single digit range and may turn negative in 2005 for certain products in some markets. In general, the pricing environment in the Specialty segment is expected to be better than in Commercial, largely due to the specialized nature of the Specialty businesses. Within Personal, the Company expects to see increased price competition in the auto segment, while the homeowners segment is expected to remain stable. The industry has experienced unprecedented low levels of claim frequency over the last several years, a trend that is not expected to change materially in 2005. Severity trend, the other component of loss trend, is expected to continue to remain stable. Nevertheless, with continued pressure on pricing, it is likely that margins will contract in certain parts of the Companys business in 2005, albeit from very strong levels. Changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new investments. While a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new fixed income investments, it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and the availability of gains on disposition. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments and the availability of realized investment gains on disposition. In 2004, interest rates began to increase after reaching their lowest levels since the 1950s in 2003. Consequently, yields available on new investments began to grow, but remained below the existing portfolios average book yield. The continuation of an upward trend in interest rates in 2005 would favorably impact the average book yield of the Companys fixed income holdings. In January 2005, the Company announced that it will explore strategic alternatives to divest its majority ownership position in Nuveen Investments, thereby providing the Company with the opportunity to increase its financial flexibility. The Company expects to realize its targeted merger related cumulative expense savings of $350 million by the end of 2005 and $450 million by the end of 2006. A portion of these savings are expected be redeployed to support growth in the Companys business segments and investments in technology. 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As required by various state laws and regulations, the Companys insurance subsidiaries are subject to assessments from state administered guaranty associations, second injury funds and similar associations. In the opinion of the Companys management, these assessments will not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Some social, economic, political and litigation issues have led to an increased number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at addressing the cost and availability of some types of insurance as well as the claim and coverage obligations of insurers. While most of these provisions have failed to become law, these initiatives may continue as legislators and regulators try to respond to public availability, affordability and claim concerns and the resulting laws, if any, could adversely affect the Companys ability to write business with appropriate returns. On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the Terrorism Act) was enacted into Federal law and established the Terrorism Insurance Program (the Program), a temporary Federal program in the Department of the Treasury, that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. In order for a loss to be covered under the Program (subject losses), the loss must be the result of an event that is certified as an act of terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. In the case of a war declared by Congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the Terrorism Act. The Terrorism Act generally requires that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the United States participate in the Program. The Program terminates on December 31, 2005. Under the Program, a participating insurer is entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal Government for 90% of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. In each case, the deductible percentage is applied to the insurers direct earned premiums from the calendar year immediately preceding the applicable year. The deductible under the Program was 7% for 2003, 10% for 2004 and is 15% for 2005. The Program also contains an annual cap that limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100 billion. Once subject losses have reached the $100 billion aggregate during a program year, there is no additional reimbursement from the U.S. Treasury and an insurer that has met its deductible for the program year is not liable for any losses (or portion thereof) that exceed the $100 billion cap. The Companys estimated deductible under this federal program is $2.51 billion for 2005. The Company had no terrorism related losses in 2004 or 2003. If the Program is not renewed for periods after January 1, 2006, the benefits of the Program will not be available to the Company, and the Company will be subject to losses from acts of terrorism subject only to the terms and provisions of applicable policies. While the Terrorism Act provides a Federally funded backstop for commercial property casualty insurers, it also requires that insurers immediately begin offering coverage for insured losses caused by acts of terrorism. The majority of the Companys Commercial and Specialty policies already included such coverage, although exclusions were added to higher risk policyholders after September 11, 2001. For those risks considered higher risk, such as landmark buildings or high concentrations of employees in one location, the Company will continue to either decline to offer a renewal or will offer coverage for losses caused by acts of terrorism on a limited basis, with an explicit charge for the coverage. There are currently various state and federal legislative and judicial proposals to require asbestos claimants to demonstrate an asbestos illness. At this time it is not possible to predict the likelihood or timing of such proposals being enacted or the effect if they are enacted. The Companys ongoing analysis of its asbestos reserves did not assume the adoption of any asbestos reforms. For information about the outlook with respect to asbestos related claims and liabilities see Asbestos Claims and Litigation and Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. TRANSACTIONS WITH FORMER AFFILIATE See notes 3 and 18 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a description of intercompany arrangements and transactions between TPC and Citigroup. 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a measure of a companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations. The liquidity requirements of the Companys business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, asset maturities and income received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. Catastrophe claims, the timing and amount of which are inherently unpredictable, may create increased liquidity requirements. The timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and increasingly by reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, recent increases in asbestos related claim payments, as well as potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. In the opinion of the Companys management, the Companys future liquidity needs will be met from all of the above sources. Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $5.24 billion, $3.83 billion and $2.93 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows in 2004 included $867 million in cash proceeds received pursuant to the commutation of specific reinsurance agreements in the second quarter described previously. Cash flows in 2004 also benefited from premium rate and volume increases. The previously discussed adjustments recorded in the second quarter did not materially impact year to date 2004 cash flows. The Company utilized $550 million of net operating loss carryforwards (NOL) during 2004, thereby reducing current regular tax payments by $193 million. At December 31, 2004, the Company had significant NOLs available to offset future taxable income. See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding NOLs. Net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2003 benefited from premium rate increases and the receipt of $361 million from Citigroup related to recoveries under the asbestos indemnification agreement in the first quarter of 2003 and $531 million of federal income taxes refunded from the Companys net operating loss carryback. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for all three years were negatively impacted by payments for asbestos and environmental liabilities and, in 2004, for reinsurance, health care and certain international runoff operations. Included in the Companys structured agreement component of asbestos loss reserves at December 31, 2004 was $395 million (net of reinsurance) for the Companys single payment contribution to the proposed settlement related to PPG, and $502 million for the Companys settlement of the Statutory and Hawaii Actions and the Common Law Claims. Although each of these settlements is subject to certain contingencies or final orders and relief as previously discussed, it is possible that these settlement amounts will be paid in 2005. Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $4.79 billion, $2.48 billion and $2.27 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 corresponds to the increase in operational cash flows, which were invested predominantly in fixed maturity securities. In 2003, cash used in investing activities was partly offset by sales of securities to fund net payment activity related to debt and junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts of $772 million. The 2002 net cash flows used in investing activities principally reflected investing of net cash from operating activities and the receipt of $4.09 billion from the first quarter 2002 initial public offering and the concurrent issuance of $867 million of convertible notes payable, partially offset by the repayment of $6.35 billion of notes payable to a former affiliate. The majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality intermediate term taxable U.S. government, corporate and mortgage backed bonds and tax exempt U.S. municipal bonds. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Companys insurance and debt obligations. The Companys management of the duration of the fixed income investment portfolio generally produces a duration that exceeds the duration of the Companys net insurance liabilities. As the Companys investment strategy focuses on asset and liability durations, and not specific cash flows, asset sales may be required to satisfy obligations and or rebalance asset portfolios. The average duration of fixed maturities and short term securities was 4.1 years as of December 31, 2004, unchanged from December 31, 2003. 83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, venture capital and real estate. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity. The primary goal of the Companys asset liability management process is to satisfy the insurance liabilities and manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Companys fixed income portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Companys insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed income portfolio exceeds the present value of the net insurance liabilities provides assurance of the Companys ability to fund the payment of claims through the sale of securities or a restructuring of the portfolio, if necessary, without jeopardizing its asset liability management objectives. The Company does not believe that the impact of selling securities before anticipated or the use of credit facilities to pay for policyholder liabilities, if necessary, would have a material impact on future liquidity or results of operations. At December 31, 2004, total cash and short term invested assets of $159 million were held at the holding company level. These liquid assets were primarily funded by dividends received from the Companys operating subsidiaries. These liquid assets, combined with other sources of funds available, primarily additional dividends from the Companys operating subsidiaries, are considered sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements of the Company. These liquidity requirements include primarily, shareholder dividends and debt service. Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $546 million, $1.10 billion and $800 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 outflows were primarily attributable to dividends paid to shareholders of $642 million. Net maturities and retirements of debt, including the repurchase of CIRIs outstanding notes, totaled $75 million in 2004. In addition, the Company repurchased the minority interest in CIRI during the second quarter for a total cost of $76 million. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2003 were primarily attributable to the redemption of $900 million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts, the repayment of $700 million of notes payable to a former affiliate and the repayment of $550 million of short term debt. Funds used in these repayments were primarily provided by the Companys issuance of $1.40 billion of senior notes in March 2003 and by cash flows provided by operating activities. These refinancing activities were initiated with the objective of lowering the average interest rate on the Companys total outstanding debt. Also reflected in 2003 was the issuance of $550 million of short term Floating Rate Notes which were used to repay the $550 million Promissory Note due in January 2004. Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2003 also included dividends paid to shareholders of $282 million. The 2002 cash flows used in financing activities reflects the repayment of $6.35 billion of notes payable to Citigroup. These payments were partially offset by the receipt of $4.09 billion from the first quarter 2002 initial public offering and the issuance of $917 million of convertible notes payable. The Company paid $636 million of common dividends in 2004, comprised of regular quarterly dividends totaling $522 million and $114 million that had been declared by SPC prior to the merger. That amount consisted of SPCs regular quarterly dividend at a rate of $0.29 per share ($66 million), and a special $0.21 per share ($48 million) dividend related to the merger. The special dividend declared by SPC prior to the closing of the merger was designed to result in the holders of SPCs common stock prior to the merger receiving aggregate dividends with record dates in 2004 of $1.16 per share, which was SPCs indicated annual dividend rate prior to the merger. On January 26, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, payable March 31, 2005 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2005. In 2004 and 2003, the Company acquired 0.4 million and 0.8 million shares (as adjusted for the merger), respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options. In 2003, TPC repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares (as adjusted for the merger) of common stock at a total cost of $40 million, representing the acquisition of shares under a repurchase program that had been approved by TPCs board of directors. TPCs repurchase program was terminated upon completion of the merger. 84 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Companys common stock will be at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of the Companys operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends would be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. Upon completion of the merger on April 1, 2004, the Company acquired all obligations related to SPCs outstanding debt, which had a carrying value of $3.68 billion at the time of the merger. In accordance with purchase accounting, the carrying value of the SPC debt acquired was adjusted to market value as of April 1, 2004 using the effective interest rate method, which resulted in a $301 million adjustment to increase the amount of the Companys consolidated debt outstanding. That fair value adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments acquired. That amortization, which totaled $56 million in 2004, reduced reported interest expense. Debt and convertible notes payable outstanding were as follows: (at December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 Short term: Commercial paper* $ 499 $ 7.875% Senior notes due April 15, 2005* 238 7.125% Senior notes due June 1, 2005* 79 Medium term notes maturing in 2005* 99 Total short term debt 915 Long term: Medium term notes with various maturities from 2006 to 2010* 298 6.75% Senior notes due November 15, 2006 150 150 5.75% Senior notes due March 15, 2007* 500 5.25% Senior notes due August 16, 2007* 442 3.75% Senior notes due March 15, 2008 400 400 4.22% Nuveen Investments third party debt due 2008* 305 4.50% Zero coupon convertible notes due 2009* 117 8.125% Senior notes due April 15, 2010* 250 7.81% Private placement notes due on various dates through 2011 20 24 5.00% Senior notes due March 15, 2013 500 500 7.75% Senior notes due April 15, 2026 200 200 7.625% Subordinated debentures due December 15, 2027* 125 8.47% Subordinated debentures due January 10, 2027* 81 4.50% Convertible junior subordinated notes payable due April 15, 2032 893 893 6.00% Convertible notes payable due December 31, 2032 50 6.375% Senior notes due March 15, 2033 500 500 8.50% Subordinated debentures due December 15, 2045* 56 8.312% Subordinated debentures due July 1, 2046* 73 7.60% Subordinated debentures due October 15, 2050* 593 Total long term debt 5,503 2,717 Total debt principal 6,418 2,717 Unamortized fair value adjustment 245 Unamortized debt issuance costs (39 ) (42 ) Total debt $ 6,624 $ 2,675 * Debt instrument acquired in merger. 85 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company has the option to defer interest payments on its convertible junior subordinated notes for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly interest periods. If the Company elects to defer interest payments on the notes, it will not be permitted, with limited exceptions, to pay dividends on its common stock during a deferral period. In February 2002, TPC paid a dividend of $1.00 billion to Citigroup in the form of a non interest bearing note payable on December 31, 2002. On December 31, 2002, this note was repaid in its entirety. Also in February 2002, TPC paid an additional dividend of $3.70 billion to Citigroup in the form of a note payable in two installments. This note was substantially prepaid following the offerings. The balance of $150 million was due on May 9, 2004. This note was prepaid on May 8, 2002. In March 2002, TPC paid a dividend of $395 million to Citigroup in the form of a note. This note was prepaid following the offerings. In March 2002, TPC issued $893 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% convertible junior subordinated notes which will mature on April 15, 2032, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. See note 10 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. In August 2002, CIRI issued $50 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% convertible notes which were to mature on December 31, 2032 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The Company repurchased these notes in 2004. See note 10 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In December 2002, TPC entered into a loan agreement with an unaffiliated lender and borrowed $550 million under a promissory note due in January 2004. The Promissory Note carried a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 25 basis points per annum. On February 5, 2003, TPC issued $550 million of Floating Rate Notes due in February 2004. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay the $550 million due on the Promissory Note. The Floating Rate Notes also carried a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 25 basis points per annum. On March 14, 2003 and June 17, 2003, the Company repurchased $75 million and $24 million, respectively, of the Floating Rate Notes at par plus accrued interest. The remaining $451 million were repaid on September 5, 2003. On March 11, 2003, TPC issued $1.40 billion of senior notes comprising $400 million of 3.75% senior notes due March 15, 2008, $500 million of 5.00% senior notes due March 15, 2013 and $500 million of 6.375% senior notes due March 15, 2033. The notes pay interest semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2003, are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of TPCs other senior unsecured indebtedness. TPC may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity by paying a make whole premium based on U.S. Treasury rates. The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were contributed to its primary subsidiary, TIGHI, so that TIGHI could prepay and refinance $500 million of 3.60% indebtedness to Citigroup and to redeem $900 million aggregate principal amount of TIGHIs 8.00% to 8.08% junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts. These trusts, in turn, used these funds to redeem $900 million of preferred capital securities on April 9, 2003. These senior notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes (the restricted notes) were not registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and could not be transferred or resold except pursuant to certain exemptions. As part of this offering, TPC agreed to file a registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the exchange of the notes for registered notes (the Exchange Notes) having terms identical to those of the senior notes described above (Exchange Offer). On April 14, 2003, TPC initiated the Exchange Offer pursuant to a Form S 4 that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, each series of Exchange Notes has been registered under the Securities Act, and the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the restricted notes do not apply to the Exchange Notes. 86 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In July 2002, concurrent with the issuance of 17.8 million of SPC common shares in a public offering, SPC issued 8.9 million equity units, each having a stated amount of $50, for gross consideration of $443 million. Each equity unit initially consists of a forward purchase contract for the Companys common stock (maturing in August 2005), and an unsecured $50 senior note of the Company (maturing in 2007). Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 9.00%, consisting of interest on the note at a rate of 5.25% and fee payments under the forward contract of 3.75%. The forward contract requires the investor to purchase, for $50, a variable number of shares of the Companys common stock on the settlement date of August 16, 2005. The number of shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the average closing price of the Companys stock on each of 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the settlement date, in relation to the $24.20 per share price of common stock at the time of the offering. Had the settlement date been December 31, 2004, the Company would have issued approximately 15 million common shares based on the average closing price of the Companys common stock immediately prior to that date. Holders of the equity units have the opportunity to participate in a required remarketing of the senior note component. The initial remarketing date is May 11, 2005. The interest rate on the senior notes will be reset on the date of the remarketing and they will bear interest from the date of the settlement of the successful remarketing at the reset rate. The Company currently intends to refinance certain maturing debt in 2005, including the $238 million of 7.875% senior notes due April 15, 2005, the $79 million of 7.125% senior notes due June 1, 2005, and a portion of the medium term notes with maturities in 2005. Line of Credit Agreements. Effective April 17, 2003, TPC entered into the following line of credit agreements with Citibank, a subsidiary of Citigroup, TPCs former parent: (i) a $250 million 45 month revolving line of credit (the 45 Month Line of Credit), and (ii) a $250 million 364 day revolving line of credit (the TPC 364 Day Line of Credit and, together with the 45 Month Line of Credit, the TPC Lines of Credit). TPC may, with Citibanks consent, extend the commitment of the 364 day Line of Credit for additional 364 day periods under the same terms and conditions. TPC has the option, provided there is no default or event of default, to convert outstanding advances under the 364 Day Line of Credit at the commitment termination date to a term loan maturing no later than one year from the commitment termination date. Prior to the merger, SPC was party to the following line of credit agreements with a syndicate of banks: (i) a $330 million 364 day revolving line of credit (the SPC 364 Day Line of Credit), and (ii) a $270 million 5 year revolving line of credit (the 5 Year Line of Credit and, together with the SPC 364 Day Line of Credit, the SPC Lines of Credit). SPC may, with bank syndicate consent, extend the commitment of the SPC 364 day Line of Credit for additional 364 day periods under the same terms and conditions. As a result of the expiration of the SPC 364 Day Line of Credit and the TPC 364 Day Line of Credit, the Company entered into a new $480 million 364 day revolving line of credit agreement (the STA 364 Day Line of Credit) with a syndicate of banks. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has access to the following bank credit lines: (i) the $250 million 45 Month Line of Credit, (ii) the $270 million 5 Year Line of Credit, and (iii) the $480 million STA 364 Day Line of Credit (collectively, the Company Line of Credit). Borrowings under the Company Line of Credit may be made, at the Companys option, at a variable interest rate equal to either the lenders base rate plus an applicable margin or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The Company Line of Credit includes a commitment fee and, for any date on which advances exceed 50% of the total commitment for each line of credit, a utilization fee. The applicable margin and the rates on which the commitment fee and utilization fee are based vary based upon the Companys long term senior unsecured non credit enhanced debt ratings. 87 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pursuant to covenants in the 5 Year Line of Credit and STA 364 Day Line of Credit, supporting the Companys commercial paper program, the Company must maintain an excess of consolidated net worth over goodwill and other intangible assets of not less than $10 billion at all times. The Company must also maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. Pursuant to the covenants in the 45 Month Line of Credit, TPC and its subsidiaries must maintain, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, combined statutory capital and surplus in excess of $5.50 billion and a leverage ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capital of less than 0.45 to 1.00. There were no ratings based triggers for the Company Line of Credit. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and all other covenants related to its respective debt instruments outstanding. An event of default will occur if there is a change in control (as defined in the 45 Month Line of Credit and 5 Year Line of Credit agreements). The merger of TPC and SPC did constitute a change in control for both TPC and SPC; however, both entities obtained a waiver from their respective banks of that event of default. There were no amounts outstanding under the Company Line of Credit at December 31, 2004. Contractual Obligations The following table excludes short term obligations. The table also excludes estimated cash flows of claim and claim related payments, which are presented in the table that follows. The contractual obligations, which include only liabilities at December 31, 2004 with a cash payment requirement for settlement, were as follows: Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Lessthan1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Debt(1) Medium term notes $ 397 $ 99 $ 128 $ 149 $ 21 Convertible notes 893 893 Senior notes 2,817 317 650 400 1,450 Capital trusts 928 928 Nuveen Investments third party debt 305 305 Zero coupon convertible notes 117 117 Equity units 442 442 Private placement notes 20 4 7 5 4 Total debt 5,919 420 1,227 976 3,296 Operating leases(2) 739 171 276 168 124 Purchase obligations Information systems administration and maintenance commitments(3) 89 31 38 20 Reinsurance brokerage commitment(4) 160 20 40 40 60 Other purchase commitments(5) 8 6 2 Total purchase obligations 257 57 80 60 60 Long term liabilities Unfunded investment commitments(6) 772 133 354 206 79 Total long term liabilities 772 133 354 206 79 Total Contractual Obligations $ 7,687 $ 781 $ 1,937 $ 1,410 $ 3,559 (1) See note 10 of the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. (2) Represents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space, equipment and furniture. 88 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (3) Includes agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services. (4) In connection with the sale of its insurance brokerage operations, the Company committed to acquire brokerage services from the buyer through 2012. See note 17. (5) Includes commitments to vendors entered into in the ordinary course of business for goods and services including office supplies, archival services, etc. (6) Represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for investments in real estate partnerships, private equities and hedge funds. The Company is not required to make any contributions to its qualified pension plan in 2005 and does not have a best estimate of contributions expected to be paid to the qualified pension plan. Accordingly, any future contributions are not included in the foregoing contractual obligation table. Estimated Claims and Claim Related Payments The table below presents the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Companys assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below, required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty. The following table includes estimated future claims and claims related payments, net of the estimated reinsurance recoveries, where applicable, at December 31, 2004. Estimated Payments by Period (in millions) Total Lessthan 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Estimated future payments resulting from: (1) Claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 42,283 $ 11,828 $ 13,331 $ 6,201 $ 10,923 (2) Claims from large deductible polices (3) Loss based assessments 195 10 46 24 115 (4) Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits 533 119 233 181 Total $ 43,011 $ 11,957 $ 13,610 $ 6,406 $ 11,038 (1) The amounts in Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables. Therefore, estimated future payments include cash inflows related to reinsurance arrangements that qualify for reinsurance accounting. A reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk, in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting. Timing risk is transferred if the agreement requires timely reimbursement from the reinsurer to the insurer. Since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are highly correlated to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, the analysis above presents the estimated cash outlay for reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expense, net of reinsurance. Reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and 89 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits in the table above. For business underwritten by non U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on December 31, 2004. The amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Companys balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses has been discounted in the balance sheet. (See note 1 of the financial statements.) (2) Workers compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. Claims from large deductible policies represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payable and contractholder receivable, respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholders escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivable) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payable), these cash flows offset each other in the table. The estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers compensation policies is presented below: (in millions) Total Less than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Contractholder payables/ receivables $ 5,629 $ 1,222 $ 2,488 $ 934 $ 985 (3) The amounts in Loss based assessments relate to estimated future payments of second injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities. Second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre existing condition. For loss based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second injury fund assessments are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. (4) The amounts in Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits. Amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Companys balance sheet to extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been discounted using deposit accounting. The above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur future payment obligations under such agreements. See note 9 of the Companys consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. Dividend Availability The Companys principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of Connecticut and Minnesota. The insurance holding company laws of both states applicable to the Companys subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, that together 90 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurers net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. (In the case of Minnesota, net income excludes realized investment gains for purposes of the calculation of the 10% threshold). This declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Companys subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $2.61 billion is available by the end of 2005 for such dividends without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department for Connecticut domiciled subsidiaries and the Minnesota Department of Commerce for Minnesota domiciled subsidiaries. The Company received $2.09 billion of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2004. Risk Based Capital The NAIC adopted RBC requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action. The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital higher than RBC requirements. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. At December 31, 2004, all of the Companys insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to agency loans and letters of credit, issuance of debt securities, third party loans related to venture capital investments and various indemnifications related to the sale of business entities to third parties. See note 17 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these arrangements to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, and investment impairments. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves (loss reserves) represent managements estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Companys assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing reserves, the Company also takes into account estimated recoveries, reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. The reserves are reviewed regularly by a qualified actuary employed by the Company. The process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims 91 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for loss and loss adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process. The Company continually refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including but not limited to the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability will be different from that anticipated at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than currently reserved favorable or unfavorable. Because establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. A portion of the Companys loss reserves are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation which aggregated $4.57 billion at December 31, 2004. While the ongoing study of asbestos claims and associated liabilities and of environmental claims considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in major litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Companys management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the Companys future operating results and financial condition. See the preceding discussion of Asbestos Claims and Litigation and Environmental Claims and Litigation. As described earlier, the Company acquired SPCs runoff health care reserves in the merger, which are included in the General Liability product line in the table below. SPC decided to exit this market at the end of 2001 and ceased underwriting new business as quickly as regulatory considerations allowed. SPC had experienced significant adverse loss development on its health care loss reserves both prior to and since its decision to exit this market. The Company continues to utilize specific tools and metrics to explicitly monitor and validate its key assumptions supporting its conclusions with regard to these reserves. These tools and metrics were established to more explicitly monitor and validate key assumptions supporting the Companys reserve conclusions since management believed that its traditional statistics and reserving methods needed to be supplemented in order to provide a more meaningful analysis. The tools developed track three primary indicators which influence those conclusions and include: newly reported claims; reserve development on known claims; and the redundancy ratio, which compares the cost of resolving claims to the reserve established for that individual claim. These three indicators are related such that if one deteriorates, additional improvement on another is necessary for the Company to conclude that further reserve strengthening is not necessary. The results of these indicators in 2004 support the Companys current view that it has recorded a reasonable provision for its medical malpractice exposures as of December 31, 2004. However, the Company will take reserve actions in the future if these indicators no longer support this view. 92 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows: 2004 2003 (at December 31, in millions) Case IBNR Total Case IBNR Total General liability $ 8,445 $ 12,232 $ 20,677 $ 3,378 $ 7,664 $ 11,042 Property 1,534 1,359 2,893 685 735 1,420 Commercial multi peril 1,979 2,216 4,195 1,325 2,059 3,384 Commercial automobile 2,817 1,966 4,783 1,587 1,131 2,718 Workers compensation 8,313 6,658 14,971 6,207 5,081 11,288 Fidelity and surety 1,216 845 2,061 264 317 581 Personal automobile 1,484 1,219 2,703 1,286 1,097 2,383 Homeowners and personal other 470 523 993 379 537 916 International and other 2,934 2,774 5,708 354 388 742 Property casualty 29,192 29,792 58,984 15,465 19,009 34,474 Accident and health 76 10 86 88 11 99 Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves $ 29,268 $ 29,802 $ 59,070 $ 15,553 $ 19,020 $ 34,573 Property casualty claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at December 31, 2004 increased by $24.51 billion over year end 2003, primarily as a result of the merger with SPC and reserve charges recorded subsequent to the merger. Of the increase in 2004, $19.50 billion resulted from the addition of the acquired reserves, and $2.39 billion, net of reinsurance, was due to net unfavorable prior year reserve development primarily comprised of $928 million to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the Companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, $800 million of reserve adjustments related to the merger for surety and construction loss reserves, $252 million related to a specific construction contractor, $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer and other net reserving actions. For discussion of the components of net unfavorable prior year reserve development, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi peril lines and International and other lines in the summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately, see Asbestos Claims and Litigation, Environmental Claims and Litigation and Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. General Discussion Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves (loss reserves) represent managements estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The process for estimating these liabilities begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. Multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. 93 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given subsequent information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of managements recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate. The exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. Property casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims made or on an occurrence basis. Policies written on a claims made basis require that claims be reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. Most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The use of the occurrence form accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, and it is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation and judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics, among others. A key assumption in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Informed management judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application, on a consistent basis over time, of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, individuals involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel as well as other company management. Therefore, it is quite possible and, generally, likely that management must consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of loss reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult. The variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. Product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. A major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more 94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag the greater the proportion of IBNR claims to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. A more recent but less extreme example is automobile leasing residual value coverage. For some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being low frequency/high severity, while lines without this large claim sensitivity are referred to as high frequency/low severity. Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to a few key assumptions. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, high frequency/low severity lines tend to have much greater spread of estimation risk, such that the impact of individual claims are relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable. Claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. Actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different experts will choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimate selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other. Lastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. During the past year, the merger of TPC and SPC resulted in the exposure of each others actuaries and claim departments to different products, data histories, analysis methodologies, claim settlement experts, and more robust data when viewed on a combined basis. This has impacted the range of estimates produced by the Companys actuaries, as they have reacted to new data, approaches, and sources of expertise to draw upon. It has also resulted in additional levels of uncertainty, as past trends (that were a function of past products, past claim handling procedures, past claim departments, and past legal and other experts) may not repeat themselves, as those items affecting the trends change or evolve due to the merger. This has also increased the potential for material variation in estimates, as experts can have differing views as to the impact of these frequently evolutionary changes. Events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends reestablish themselves within the new organization. Risk factors The major causes of material uncertainty (risk factors) generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. In some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently. Some risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components. 95 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors. The evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region. While some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in step wise fashion. The final impact is not known until all steps have occurred. Sudden changes generally cause a one time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. Managements estimates At least once per quarter, Company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claim and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability. Such an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform. This is due to the need to evaluate the underlying cause of the trends observed, and may include the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Companys estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is a function of these detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information. Discussion of Product Lines The following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. General Liability General liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of 96 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self insured retentions. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within 5 to 7 years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade for construction defect claims). While the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are typically insured on a claims made basis. General liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholders legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimants private property arising from the policyholders legal obligation for non intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. In addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately, such as asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect, medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on traditional actuarial methods. Defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim. Such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims made products. When defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid do not erode the policy limits. This line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e. the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag, i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and or latent claim exposure. The amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the General Liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved, and greatest claim settlement complexity are Asbestos and Environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than Asbestos and Environmental, include construction defect, medical malpractice, and other mass tort actions, such as those related to silicone implants. Many components of General Liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably 97 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: General liability risk factors Changes in claim handling philosophies Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision New theories of liability Trends in jury awards Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues Changes in statutes of limitations Changes in the underlying court system Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues Changes in tort law Shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) Changes in settlement patterns (e.g. medical malpractice) General liability book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Property Property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims. Property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Property risk factors Physical concentration of policyholders Availability and cost of local contractors For the more severe catastrophic events, demand surge inflation, whereby the greatly increased demand for building materials such as plywood far surpasses the immediate supply, leading to short term material increases in building material costs Local building codes Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims) Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition) Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake) Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations 98 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Property book of business risk factors Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards Commercial Multi Peril Commercial multi peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims. The reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi peril is generally sold to smaller sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and property include larger customers. See the discussions under the property and general liability product lines with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi peril. Commercial Automobile The commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. Commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components; bodily injury liability, property damage liability, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors Trends in jury awards Changes in the underlying court system Changes in case law Litigation trends Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents Subrogation opportunities Changes in claim handling philosophies Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Types of medical treatments received Changes in cost of medical treatments Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment 99 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Commercial automobile book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non fleets) Changes in underwriting standards Workers Compensation Workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured workers life, such as permanent disability benefits and on going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tail, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency, moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a workers injury. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk. Workers compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required workers compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Indemnity risk factors Time required to recover from the injury Degree of available transitional jobs Degree of legal involvement Changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers compensation commissions oversight of claims1 Future wage inflation for states that index benefits Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds Medical risk factors Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (inflation) Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Type of medical treatments received Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices Availability of new medical processes and equipment Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment  1 These are administrative bodies that evaluate whether or not a given claim for workers compensation benefits is valid. Duties include the determination of whether a given injury arose out of the scope of employment, or the determination of the degree of injury where disputes exist. 100 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Workers compensation book of business risk factors Product mix Injury type mix Changes in underwriting standards General workers compensation risk factors Frequency of claim reopenings on claims previously closed Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment Degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and health insurance Fidelity and Surety Fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insureds business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas, the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity policies. Surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a somewhat longer settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (Large construction projects can take many years to complete.) The frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability to perform financially. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insureds assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Fidelity risk factors Type of business of insured Policy limit and attachment points Third party claims Coverage litigation Complexity of claims Growth in insureds operations Surety risk factors Economic trends, including the general level of construction activity Concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims Type of business insured Type of obligation insured Cumulative limits of liability for insured 101 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Assets available to mitigate loss Defective workmanship/latent defects Financial strategy of insured Changes in statutory obligations Geographic spread of business Personal Automobile Personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity.product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. Personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors Trends in jury awards Changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy Changes in case law Litigation trends Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents Subrogation opportunities Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Changes in claim handling philosophies No fault risk factors (for selected states and time periods) Effectiveness of no fault laws Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Types of medical treatments received Changes in cost of medical treatments Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Personal automobile book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Changes in underwriting standards Homeowners and Personal Lines Other Homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the 102 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The claim is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made (or alternatively, the property replacement/repair is performed by the insurer). The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. The liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. In addition, reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future. Overall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. Homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include: Non catastrophe risk factors Salvage opportunities Amount of time to return property to residential use Changes in weather patterns Local building codes Litigation trends Trends in jury awards Catastrophe risk factors Physical concentration of policyholders Availability and cost of local contractors Local building codes Quality of construction of damaged homes Amount of time to return property to residential use For the more severe catastrophic events, demand surge inflation, whereby the greatly increased demand for building materials such as plywood far surpasses the immediate supply, leading to short term material increases in building material costs Homeowners book of business risk factors Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Degree of concentration of policyholders Changes in underwriting standards International and other International and other includes the international product line and other products not discussed above. The principle component of other is assumed reinsurance written on an excess of loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non U.S. exposures, and is primarily run off business. 103 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework. Due to changes in the business mix for this line over time, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct), and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co insurers through a broker or lead insurer for claim settlement purposes. International and other reserves are generally analyzed by program/pool, country and general coverage category (e.g., U.S. Liability excess of loss reinsurance, or General Liability Municipalities by country.) The business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage/jurisdiction. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the General Liability and Automobile discussion above, but under a different legal system. Where the underlying hazard is within the U.S., the coverage involved is typically that of General Liability, but on an excess or excess of loss reinsurance basis. Excess exposure requires the insured to prove not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policys attachment point. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: International and other risk factors Changes in claim handling philosophies Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision New theories of liability Trends in jury awards Changes in the propensity to sue Changes in statutes of limitations Changes in the underlying court system Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues Changes in tort law Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) International and other book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, claims made language) Changes in underwriting standards Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) 104 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Reinsurance Recoverables The following table summarizes the composition of the Companys reinsurance recoverable assets: (at December 31, in millions) 2004 2003 Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 13,367 $ 6,946 Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (751 ) (387 ) Net reinsurance recoverables 12,616 6,559 Mandatory pools and associations 2,497 2,204 Structured settlements 3,941 2,411 Total reinsurance recoverables $ 19,054 $ 11,174 Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured business. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Companys rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Companys ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses, and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. Changes in these estimates could result in additional income statement charges. The increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance in 2004 was $364 million, $256 million of which was merger related and $108 million of which resulted from the Companys ongoing review process described above. The following presents the Companys top five reinsurers, except Lloyds of London (Lloyds), which is discussed in more detail below, by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2004 (in millions): Reinsurer Reinsurance Recoverable A.M. Best Rating of Reinsurer American Re Insurance Company $ 1,198 A third highest of 16 ratings General Reinsurance Corporation 826 A++ highest of 16 ratings XL Reinsurance America Inc. 613 A+ second highest of 16 ratings Transatlantic Reinsurance Company 604 A+ second highest of 16 ratings Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation 493 A+ second highest of 16 ratings As of December 31, 2004, the Company had reinsurance recoverables from syndicates at Lloyds of $738 million. In 1996, Lloyds restructured its operations with respect to claims for years prior to 1993 and reinsured these into Equitas Limited, which is currently unrated. Approximately $90 million of the Companys Lloyds reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2004 relates to Equitas liabilities. The remaining recoverables of $648 million are from the continuing market of Lloyds, which is rated A (third highest of 16 ratings) by A.M. Best. During the first quarter of 2004, TPC entered into an agreement to settle all current and future reinsurance claims against certain underwriters at Lloyds reinsured by Equitas. Under terms of this settlement, the Company received $245 million, resolving approximately $255 million of TPCs net claim balances from Equitas. Virtually all of the $90 million reinsurance recoverables relating to Equitas remaining at December 31, 2004 relate to SPC. 105 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investment Impairments Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities An investment in a fixed maturity or equity security which is available for sale or reported at fair value is impaired if its fair value falls below its book value and the decline is considered to be other than temporary. Fixed maturities for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost for more than one quarter are evaluated for other than temporary impairment. A fixed maturity is impaired if it is probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due under the securitys contractual terms. Factors the Company considers in determining whether a decline is other than temporary for debt securities include the following: the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost. It is likely that the decline will become other than temporary if the market value has been below cost for six to nine months or more; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. The issuer may be experiencing depressed and declining earnings relative to competitors, erosion of market share, deteriorating financial position, lowered dividend payments, declines in securities ratings, bankruptcy, and financial statement reports that indicate an uncertain future. Also, the issuer may experience specific events that may influence its operations or earnings potential, such as changes in technology, discontinuation of a business segment, catastrophic losses or exhaustion of natural resources; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. Equity investments are impaired when it becomes probable that the Company will not recover its cost over the expected holding period. Public equity investments (i.e., common stocks) trading at a price that is less than 80% of cost for more than one quarter are reviewed for impairment. Investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment any time the investment has sustained losses and or negative operating cash flow for a period of nine months or more. Events triggering the other than temporary impairment analysis of public and non public equities may include the following, in addition to the considerations noted above for debt securities: Factors affecting performance: the investee loses a principal customer or supplier for which there is no short term prospect for replacement or experiences other substantial changes in market conditions; the company is performing substantially and consistently behind plan; the investee has announced, or the Company has become aware of, adverse changes or events such as changes or planned changes in senior management, restructurings, or a sale of assets; and the regulatory, economic, or technological environment has changed in a way that is expected to adversely affect the investees profitability. Factors affecting on going financial condition: factors that raise doubts about the investees ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies, investment advisors recommendations, or non compliance with regulatory capital requirements or debt covenants; a secondary equity offering at a price substantially lower than the holders cost; a breach of a covenant or the failure to service debt; and fraud within the company. 106 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For fixed maturity and equity investments, factors that may indicate that a decline in value is not other than temporary include the following: the securities owned continue to generate reasonable earnings and dividends, despite a general stock market decline; bond interest or preferred stock dividend rate (on cost) is lower than rates for similar securities issued currently but quality of investment is not adversely affected; the investment is performing as expected and is current on all expected payments; specific, recognizable, short term factors have affected the market value; and financial condition, market share, backlog and other key statistics indicate growth. Real Estate Investments The carrying values of real estate properties are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The review for impairment includes an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property. An impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the real estate property. Venture Capital Investments Other investments include venture capital investments, which are generally non publicly traded instruments, consisting of early stage companies and, historically, having a holding period of four to seven years. These investments have primarily been made in the health care, software and computer services, and networking and information technologies infrastructures industries. The Company typically is involved with venture capital companies early in their formation, as they are developing and determining the viability of, and market demand for, their product. Generally the Company does not expect these venture capital companies to record revenues in the early stages of their development, which can often take three to four years, and does not generally expect them to become profitable for an even longer period of time. With respect to the Companys valuation of such non publicly traded venture capital investments, on a quarterly basis, portfolio managers as well as an internal valuation committee review and consider a variety of factors in determining the potential for loss impairment. Factors considered include the following: the issuers most recent financing event; an analysis of whether fundamental deterioration has occurred; whether or not the issuers progress has been substantially less than expected; whether or not the valuations have declined significantly in the entitys market sector; whether or not the internal valuation committee believes it is probable that the issuer will need financing within six months at a lower price than our carrying value; and whether or not we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery, enabling us to receive value equal to or greater than our cost. The quarterly valuation procedures described above are in addition to the portfolio managers ongoing responsibility to frequently monitor developments affecting those invested assets, paying particular attention to events that might give rise to impairment write downs. The Company manages the portfolio to maximize long term return, evaluating current market conditions and the future outlook for the entities in which it has invested. Because this portfolio primarily consists of 107 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements privately held, early stage venture investments, events giving rise to impairment can occur in a brief period of time (e.g., the entity has been unsuccessful in securing additional financing, other investors decide to withdraw their support, complications arise in the product development process, etc.), and decisions are made at that point in time, based on the specific facts and circumstances, with respect to a recognition of other than temporary impairment or sale of the investment. Non Publicly Traded Investments The Companys investment portfolio includes non publicly traded investments, such as venture capital investments, private equity limited partnerships, joint ventures, other limited partnerships, and certain fixed income securities. Venture capital investments owned directly are consolidated in the Companys financial statements. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures, limited partnerships and certain private equity securities. Certain other private equity investments, including venture capital investments, are not subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, but are reported at estimated fair value in accordance with FAS 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. The fair value of the venture capital investments is based on an estimate determined by an internal valuation committee for securities for which there is no public market. The internal valuation committee reviews such factors as recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth, and other business and market sector fundamental statistics in estimating fair values of specific investments. The following is a summary of the approximate carrying value of the Companys non publicly traded securities at December 31, 2004: (in millions) Carrying Value Investment partnerships, including hedge funds $ 1,883 Fixed income securities 328 Equity investments 355 Real estate partnerships and joint ventures 155 Venture capital 441 Total $ 3,162 OTHER MATTERS On July 23, 2004, the Company announced that it was seeking guidance from the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the Securities Exchange Commission with respect to the appropriate purchase accounting treatment for certain second quarter 2004 adjustments totaling $1.63 billion ($1.07 billion after tax). The Company recorded these adjustments as charges in its income statement in the second quarter of 2004. Through an informal comment process, the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance has subsequently asked for further information relating to these adjustments, and the dialogue is ongoing. Specifically, the staff has asked for information concerning the Companys adjustments to certain of SPCs insurance reserves and reserves for reinsurance recoverables and premiums due from policyholders, and how those adjustments may relate to SPCs reserves for periods prior to the merger. After reviewing the staffs questions and comments and discussions with the Companys independent auditors, the Company continues to believe that its accounting treatment for these adjustments is appropriate. If, however, the staff disagrees, some or all of the adjustments being discussed may not be recorded as charges in the Companys income statement, thereby increasing net income for the second quarter and full year 2004 and increasing shareholders equity at December 31, 2004, in each case by the approximate after tax amount of the change. The effect on tangible shareholders equity (adjusted for the effects of deferred taxes associated with goodwill and intangible assets) at December 31, 2004 would not be material. Increases to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities would be reflected on the Companys balance sheet as of April 1, 2004, either due to purchase accounting or adjustment of SPCs reserves prior to the merger. 108 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on a statutory basis were $41.73 billion, $24.03 billion and $23.28 billion at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $17.70 billion increase in 2004 primarily resulted from the merger with SPC and reserve charges recorded subsequent to the merger. Those reserve charges included $928 million to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the Companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, reserve adjustments related to the merger of $500 million for construction and $300 million for surety, $252 million related to a specific construction contractor, $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer, and other net reserving actions. The $749 million increase in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on a statutory basis from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 was primarily due to business growth, and reserve strengthening at Gulf which increased reserves by $521 million and American Equity which increased reserves by $115 million, partially offset by asbestos and environmental net loss payments of $607 million. Prior to the IPO, TPC participated in Citigroups Capital Accumulation Plan (CAP) that provided for the issuance of shares of Citigroup common stock in the form of restricted stock awards to eligible officers and other key employees. On August 20, 2002, in connection with the Citigroup Distribution, the unvested outstanding awards of restricted stock and deferred shares held by TPC employees on that date under Citigroup CAP awards were cancelled and replaced by awards comprised primarily of 3 million newly issued shares of class A common stock at a total market value of $53 million based on the closing price of the class A common stock on August 20, 2002. These replacement awards were granted on substantially the same terms, including vesting, as the former Citigroup awards. The value of these newly issued shares along with class A and class B common stock received in the Citigroup Distribution on the Citigroup restricted shares, were equal to the value of the cancelled Citigroup restricted share awards. In addition the Board of Directors plan allows deferred receipt of shares of class A common stock (deferred stock) to a future distribution date or upon termination of their service. Prior to the Citigroup Distribution on August 20, 2002, unearned compensation expense associated with the Citigroup restricted common stock grants is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Following the Citigroup Distribution and the issuance of replacement stock awards in TPCs class A and class B shares on August 20, 2002, the unamortized unearned compensation expense associated with these awards is included as unearned compensation in the consolidated balance sheet. Unearned compensation expense is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period. The after tax compensation cost charged to earnings for these restricted stock and deferred stock awards was $26 million, $17 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See note 13 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a discussion of restricted common stock awards.

FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See note 1 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This report may contain, and management may make, certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward looking statements. Specifically, the Company may make forward looking 109 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements statements about the Companys results of operations (including, among others, premium volume and net and operating income), financial condition and liquidity; the sufficiency of the Companys asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the post merger integration (including, among others, expense savings); and strategic initiatives (including, among others, the sale of the Companys interest in Nuveen Investments). Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Companys control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward looking information and statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: adverse developments involving asbestos claims and related litigation; the impact of aggregate policy coverage limits for asbestos claims; the impact of bankruptcies of various asbestos producers and related businesses; the willingness of parties including the Company to settle asbestos related litigation; the Companys ability to fully integrate the former St. Paul and Travelers businesses in the manner or in the timeframe currently anticipated; the Companys ability to execute announced and future strategic initiatives as planned; insufficiency of, or changes in, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves; the Companys inability to obtain prices sought due to competition or otherwise; the occurrence of catastrophic events, both natural and man made, including terrorist acts, with a severity or frequency exceeding the Companys expectations; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, environmental claims and related litigation; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, construction defect claims; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, the Companys medical malpractice and other runoff operations; exposure to, and adverse developments involving, claims related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, including, but not limited to, lead paint, silica and other potentially harmful substances; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures in medical costs and auto and building repair costs; the effects of corporate bankruptcies and adverse economic conditions on surety bond claims; adverse developments in the cost, availability and or ability to collect reinsurance; the ability of the Companys subsidiaries to pay dividends to The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc.; adverse developments in legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, those described under Legal Proceedings; judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability, including with respect to, among others, coverage for asbestos and environmental claims and construction defect claims; the impact of legislative and other governmental actions, including, but not limited to, federal and state legislation related to asbestos liability reform and terrorism insurance and reinsurance (such as the extension of or replacement for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002) and governmental actions regarding insurance companies compensation of brokers and agents and insurance companies purchase or sale of finite reinsurance; the performance of the Companys investment portfolios, which could be adversely impacted by adverse developments in U.S. and global and financial markets, interest rates and rates of inflation; weakening U.S. and global economic conditions; larger than expected assessments for guaranty funds and mandatory pooling arrangements; a downgrade in the Companys claims paying and financial strength ratings; the loss or significant restriction on the Companys ability to use credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of Personal policies; and changes to the regulatory capital requirements. The Companys forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update its forward looking statements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and other relevant market rate or price changes. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The following is a discussion of the Companys primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of December 31, 2004. The Companys market risk sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading. 110 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The carrying value of the Companys investment portfolio as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $64.71 billion and $38.65 billion, respectively, of which 84% and 85% was invested in fixed maturity securities, respectively. At December 31, 2004, approximately 7% of the Companys invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys exposure to foreign exchange risk was not significant at December 31, 2003. The Companys exposure to equity price risk is not significant. The Company has no direct commodity risk. The primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. The portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions. The primary market risk for all of the Companys debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing. The Company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. For additional information regarding the Companys debt see notes 10 and 11 to the Companys consolidated financial statements as well as the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis. As a result of the merger, changes in the Companys exposure to foreign exchange risk have occurred since December 31, 2003. This market risk exposure is concentrated in the Companys invested assets, and insurance reserves, denominated in foreign currencies. Cash flows from the Companys foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Invested assets denominated in the British Pound Sterling comprised approximately 3.5% of the total invested assets at December 31, 2004. No other individual foreign currency accounted for more than 1.5% of the Companys invested assets at December 31, 2004. There were no other significant changes in the Companys primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time. In the Companys sensitivity analysis model, a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates. Near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the Company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value. Interest Rate Risk In this sensitivity analysis model, the Company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. The sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short term securities, debt and derivative financial instruments. The primary market risk to the Companys market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk. The sensitivity analysis model uses a 100 basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model. 111 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates. Durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. Durations on tax exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the U.S. Treasury curve. Fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including accrued interest, using holdings as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. For debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical December 31, 2004 and 2003 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change, comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding. The sensitivity analysis model used by the Company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion based on a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the Company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends. In addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. As a result, the loss value excludes a significant portion of the Companys consolidated balance sheet, which if included in the sensitivity analysis model, would mitigate the impact of the loss in fair value associated with a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. A hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. The potential loss is reduced by foreign currency forward transactions that are used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to foreign currencies. The Companys analysis indicates that a hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $438 million at December 31, 2004. The Companys exposure to foreign exchange risk was not significant at December 31, 2003.
