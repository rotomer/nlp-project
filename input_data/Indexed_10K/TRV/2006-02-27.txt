Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). On April 1, 2004, Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) merged with a subsidiary of The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (SPC), as a result of which TPC became a wholly owned subsidiary of SPC, and SPC changed its name to The St. Paul Travelers, Inc. In connection with the merger, each issued and outstanding share of TPC class A (including the associated Companies preferred stock purchase rights) and class B par value $0.01 common stock was exchanged for 0.4334 of a share of the Companys common stock without designated par value. Share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the second quarter exchange of TPC common stock for the Companys common stock in the merger. For accounting purposes, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with TPC treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, this transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination, using TPC historical financial information and applying fair value estimates to the acquired assets, liabilities, and commitments of SPC as of April 1, 2004. Beginning on April 1, 2004, the results of operations and financial condition of SPC were consolidated with TPCs. Accordingly, all financial information presented herein for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 reflects the consolidated accounts of SPC and TPC. The financial information presented herein for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 reflects only the accounts of TPC for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the consolidated accounts of SPC and TPC for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. The financial information presented herein for 2003 reflects the accounts of TPC. For more information regarding the completion of the merger, including the calculation and allocation of the purchase price, refer to note 2 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this report. The Company completed the divestiture of its 78% equity interest in Nuveen Investments in 2005, which is described in more detail later in this discussion. The Companys share of Nuveen Investments operating results in 2005 prior to divestiture was classified as discontinued operations, and the Companys prior year results were reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2005 Consolidated Results of Operations Income from continuing operations of $2.06 billion, or $3.04 per share basic and $2.95 diluted Net income of $1.62 billion, or $2.39 per share basic and $2.33 diluted, including loss from discontinued operations of $439 million, or $0.65 per share basic and $0.62 diluted Net proceeds of $2.40 billion from the divestiture of Nuveen Investments; loss from discontinued operations resulted from significant tax provision related to sale Total cost of catastrophes of $2.19 billion pretax (net of reinsurance) and $1.47 billion after tax, primarily relating to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma Net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $325 million pretax and $216 million after tax, primarily due to a pretax charge of $830 million ($548 million after tax) to increase asbestos reserves Gross written premiums of $23.74 billion; net written premiums of $20.39 billion; net written premiums reduced by $121 million of reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes GAAP combined ratio of 101.3, including 10.7 points from catastrophe losses Pretax net investment income of $3.17 billion ($2.44 billion after tax) 2005 Consolidated Financial Condition Total assets of $113.19 billion, up $1.94 billion from December 31, 2004 Total investments of $68.29 billion, up $3.92 billion from December 31, 2004; fixed maturities and short term securities comprise 93% of total investments Increase in investments resulted from proceeds from Nuveen Investments divestiture and strong operating cash flows Total debt of $5.85 billion, down $463 million from December 31, 2004 Shareholders equity of $22.30 billion, up $1.10 billion from December 31, 2004; book value per common share of $31.94 56 CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The Company provides a wide range of property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and individuals, primarily in the United States and in selected international markets. Consolidated Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues Premiums $ 20,341 $ 19,038 $ 12,545 Net investment income 3,165 2,663 1,869 Fee income 664 706 560 Net realized investment gains (losses) 17 (39 ) 38 Other revenues 178 176 127 Total revenues 24,365 22,544 15,139 Claims and expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses 14,927 15,439 9,118 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 3,252 2,978 1,984 General and administrative expenses 3,229 2,945 1,641 Interest expense 286 236 167 Total claims and expenses 21,694 21,598 12,910 Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 2,671 946 2,229 Income tax expense 610 69 537 Minority interest, net of tax 10 (4 ) Income from continuing operations 2,061 867 1,696 Discontinued operations: Operating income (loss), net of taxes (663 ) 88 Gain on disposal, net of taxes 224 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (439 ) 88 Net income $ 1,622 $ 955 $ 1,696 Income from continuing operations per share Basic $ 3.04 $ 1.42 $ 3.91 Diluted (1) $ 2.95 $ 1.40 $ 3.80 GAAP combined ratio Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 71.9 % 79.4 % 70.7 % Underwriting expense ratio 29.4 28.3 25.6 GAAP combined ratio 101.3 % 107.7 % 96.3 % (1) The weighted average number of common shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2004 excluded the potentially dilutive effect of the Companys convertible junior subordinated notes because their effect was anti dilutive. The Companys discussions related to all items, other than net income, income from continuing operations, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and segment operating income (loss), are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the following discussion, the Company references the impact of the merger, which in the context of a comparison between 2005 and 2004 refers to the Companys 2005 results reflecting a full year of combined post merger operations, whereas the Companys 2004 results reflect combined post merger operations for the nine months subsequent to the April 1, 2004 merger date, plus the results of TPC only for the three months ended March 31, 2004. In the context of a comparison between 2004 and 2003, the impact of the merger refers to the Companys 2004 results reflecting the components described above, whereas the Companys 2003 results include the results of TPC only for the full year. 57 Overview Income from continuing operations in 2005 totaled $2.06 billion, or $2.95 per share diluted, compared with income from continuing operations of $867 million, or $1.40 per share diluted, in 2004. The increase in income in 2005 reflected the impact of the merger, improved non catastrophe current year loss experience in the Companys three business segments, a decline in net unfavorable prior year reserve development and strong growth in net investment income. These factors more than offset a significant increase in the cost of catastrophes (including reinstatement premiums and state assessments), which totaled $2.19 billion in 2005, compared with $772 million in 2004. Catastrophe losses in 2005 primarily related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, as described in more detail in the following narrative. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2005 totaled $325 million, compared with net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $2.39 billion in 2004. The 2005 total was driven by a charge of $830 million to strengthen asbestos reserves as a result of the Companys annual asbestos liability review, which was partially offset by other non asbestos related net favorable prior year reserve development in the Personal and Commercial segments. The net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2004 total was the result of several significant reserve charges recorded subsequent to the merger and which are discussed in more detail in the following narrative. In 2005, the Company sold its equity interest in Nuveen Investments, which constituted its Asset Management segment. The Company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $439 million in 2005, consisting primarily of $710 million of tax expense which resulted from the difference between the tax basis and the GAAP carrying value of the Companys investment in Nuveen Investments, partially offset by the $224 million after tax gain on the divestiture and the Companys share of Nuveen Investments net income for 2005. Income from discontinued operations of $88 million in 2004 represented the Companys share of Nuveen Investments net income for the year. Income from continuing operations in 2004 totaled $867 million, or $1.40 per share diluted, compared with $1.70 billion, or $3.80 per share diluted, in 2003. The $829 million decline in 2004 compared with 2003 was driven by $2.39 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve development. That net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2004 was concentrated in the Commercial and Specialty segments and was primarily comprised of $928 million to strengthen asbestos reserves as a result of the completion of the Companys annual asbestos liability review, merger related reserve strengthening of $500 million for construction and $300 million for surety, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, $252 million related to the financial condition of a specific construction contractor and $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer. These charges are described in more detail in the following segment discussions. In addition, 2004 income from continuing operations included $296 million of pretax charges to increase the allowance for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables, policyholder receivables and co surety participations on a specific construction contractor claim. Net unfavorable reserve development in the Commercial and Specialty segments in 2004 more than offset additional income resulting from the merger and strong operating income generated by the Companys Personal segment. In addition, the cost of catastrophes in 2004 of $772 million was $420 million higher than in 2003. The catastrophe losses in 2004 were primarily driven by four hurricanes that struck the southeastern United States in the third quarter. Revenues Earned Premiums The $1.30 billion increase in earned premiums in 2005 over 2004 primarily reflected the impact of the merger, which was partially offset by a significant decline in earned premiums in the Commercial segments runoff operations, where business is intentionally being non renewed, and a decline in Commercials ongoing operations due to a lower level of net written premium volume in the last half of 2004 and first half of 2005. Earned premiums in 2005 were reduced by $121 million of reinstatement premiums related to catastrophe losses, which are described in more detail in the Cost of Catastrophe section of this discussion. Earned premiums in 2004 were reduced by $76 million of reinstatement premiums primarily related to reserve charges recorded in the Surety operation. Partially offsetting these factors were the impacts of new business growth and increased retention in many of the Companys insurance operations in 2005. In 2004, the $6.49 billion growth in earned premiums over 2003 was primarily due to the merger, as well as the earned premium effect of rate increases on renewal business over the previous 12 months and strong customer retention levels throughout a majority of the markets served by the Companys insurance operations. 58 Net Investment Income Net investment income of $3.17 billion in 2005 grew $502 million, or 19%, over 2004, reflecting the impact of the merger, as well as an increase in invested assets over the last twelve months, higher short term interest rates and a decline in investment expenses. The increase in invested assets in 2005 was driven by continued strong operational cash flows and the investment of the $2.40 billion in proceeds from the divestiture of the Companys equity interest in Nuveen Investments. The average pretax investment yield in 2005 of 4.7% declined slightly from 4.8% in 2004, due to the maturity of higher yielding bonds and a higher proportion of tax exempt investments. Net investment income in 2004 included $111 million from the initial public offering of one investment. Net investment income in 2004 increased $794 million over 2003, largely due to the increase in invested assets resulting from the merger. In addition, strong operational cash flows in 2004 contributed to the growth in invested assets. The average pretax investment yield in 2004 of 4.8% declined from 5.3% in 2003, due to a higher proportion of tax exempt investments and lower yields on fixed income securities and alternative investments. In addition, SPCs investment portfolio acquired in the merger was recorded at its fair value as of the merger date in accordance with purchase accounting, which reduced the Companys reported average investment yield in 2004. The Company allocates invested assets and the related net investment income to its identified business segments. Pretax net investment income is allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. The investment yield for investable funds reflects the duration of the loss reserves future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the losses were incurred and A+ rated corporate debt instruments. This duration yield is compared to the average portfolio yield and a new average yield is determined. It is this average yield that is used in the calculation of net investment income on investable funds. Fee Income Fee income in 2005 declined 6% when compared with 2004, as the National Accounts market, the primary source of the Companys fee based business, experienced increased competition, particularly in the large account sector, as described in more detail in the Commercial segment discussion that follows. In 2004, the 26% increase in fee income reflected higher new business levels resulting, in part, from a third quarter 2003 renewal rights transaction, as well as renewal price increases and an increase in workers compensation business written through state residual market pools. Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) Net pretax realized investment gains in 2005 totaled $17 million, primarily generated from sales of venture capital investments and equity securities. In addition, the Company realized a pretax gain of $21 million from the sale of its Personal Catastrophe Risk operation and $13 million of pretax net gains related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts which are marked to market and settled daily. Net realized investment gains in 2005 were reduced by $109 million of impairment losses, which were concentrated in the venture capital portfolio as described in more detail later in this discussion. The Companys net pretax realized investment losses of $39 million in 2004 included impairment charges totaling $80 million, whereas net pretax realized gains of $38 million in 2003 included $90 million of impairment charges. Net pretax realized investment gains (losses) in 2004 and 2003 also included net losses of $44 million and $27 million, respectively, related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Further information regarding the nature of impairment charges in each year is included in the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this discussion. Other Revenues Other revenues in all periods presented primarily consist of premium installment charges. Written Premiums Consolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (for the year ended December 31, in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Commercial $ 10,426 $ 8,429 $ 10,636 $ 8,311 $ 8,668 $ 6,862 Specialty 6,836 5,729 5,511 4,771 1,457 1,258 Personal 6,474 6,228 6,111 5,929 5,245 5,081 Total $ 23,736 $ 20,386 $ 22,258 $ 19,011 $ 15,370 $ 13,201 59 Gross and net written premiums in 2005 both increased 7% over 2004, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. However, gross and net written premium volumes in 2005 were down when compared to 2004 on a pro forma combined basis. The declines were concentrated in the Commercial segment, reflecting the planned non renewal of business in runoff and reduced premium volume in ongoing operations due to increasingly competitive market conditions. In addition, premium volume in the Specialty segments Construction operation was lower than in 2004 on a pro forma basis due to the now completed process of aligning the underwriting profile of the two predecessor companies. Net written premiums in 2005 were reduced by $121 million of reinstatement premiums related to catastrophe losses discussed later in this narrative, whereas 2004 net written premium volume was reduced by $76 million of reinstatement premiums primarily related to reserving actions in the Specialty segment. However, premium volume in the Personal segment increased over 2004, driven by continued renewal price increases and unit growth in the homeowners line of business. During 2005, the Company experienced strong retention levels on a company wide basis, as the Company focused on retaining its existing book of well priced, profitable business. New business levels in several of the Companys insurance operations also increased over 2004. Rate increases, however, were generally lower in 2005 compared with 2004, reflecting increased competition and more aggressive pricing in the marketplace. Rates for certain products in selected markets declined from 2004 levels. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company implemented changes in the timing and structure of reinsurance purchased in the Specialty segment. The change in structure resulted in an increase in ceded premiums in 2005 when compared with 2004. The Company also made a modest adjustment to 2004 ceded written premiums to report at inception all ceded written premiums for reinsurance agreements that have minimum amounts required to be ceded. Previously, ceded written premiums for certain of these agreements were reported over the life of the contracts. This adjustment affected only the statistical disclosure of net written premiums on a quarter by quarter basis; it did not affect net written premium amounts over the lives of the respective agreements, nor did it impact gross written premiums, earned premiums, operating results or capital. The adjustment was made to conform the statistical measurement of production net written premiums across the Companys businesses. The $5.81 billion, or 44%, increase in consolidated net written premiums in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily reflected the impact of the merger. On a pro forma combined basis, net written premiums in 2004 were level with 2003. Business retention levels in the majority of the Companys insurance operations remained consistent with 2003 levels. The level of rate increases, however, continued to decline during 2004, reflecting the increasingly competitive marketplace. New business volume in the Commercial and Specialty segments in 2004 declined when compared with the combined new business volume of SPC and TPC in the prior year, reflecting the competitive marketplace and the impact of new business premiums in 2003 from renewal rights transactions. The non renewal of certain commercial property, construction and surety risks as well as certain personal lines business in the Companys operations at Lloyds also negatively impacted premium volume in 2004. Personal net written premiums increased 17% in 2004 over 2003, due to strong organic growth, new business resulting from a renewal rights transaction, strong business retention levels and price increases. Claims and expenses Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses of $14.93 billion in 2005 were $512 million lower than the 2004 total of $15.44 billion. The 2005 total included $2.03 billion of catastrophe losses, compared with $761 million of such losses in 2004. The cost of catastrophes is discussed in more detail in the following narrative. The 2005 total also included $325 million of net unfavorable prior year reserve development, compared with $2.39 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2004. The net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2005 was concentrated in the Commercial segment and was primarily the result of a charge to increase asbestos reserves as a result of the Companys annual asbestos liability review. That charge was partially offset by other, non asbestos related, net favorable prior year development in the Personal and Commercial segments. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2005 also reflected improvement in current accident year non catastrophe related loss experience as compared with 2004. Claims and claim adjustment expenses of $15.44 billion in 2004 were $6.32 billion higher than the comparable 2003 total, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. The 2004 net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $2.39 billion included a $928 million charge to increase asbestos reserves, a $290 million charge to increase environmental reserves, a charge of $252 million related to the financial condition of a specific construction contractor, and charges to increase Construction and Surety reserves in the Specialty segment by $500 million and $300 million, respectively. The Company also commuted certain reinsurance agreements with a major reinsurer in 2004 resulting in a $113 million prior year reserve 60 charge (in addition to a current year loss of $40 million). Commutations are a complete and final settlement with a reinsurer that results in a discharge of all obligations of the parties to the terminated reinsurance agreement. These and other components of 2004 unfavorable prior year reserve development are described in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2003 totaled $476 million and was primarily the result of reserve strengthening at the Companys Gulf subsidiary. The 2004 total also included $761 million of catastrophe losses (net of reinsurance), compared with catastrophe losses of $352 million in 2003. Cost of Catastrophes. The Companys cost of catastrophes, net of reinsurance and including reinstatement premiums and state assessments, totaled $2.19 billion in 2005, primarily resulting from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama in August 2005, Hurricane Rita made landfall in Texas and Louisiana in September 2005 and Hurricane Wilma made landfall in Florida in October 2005. In 2004, the cost of catastrophes, net of reinsurance, totaled $772 million, all of which resulted from four hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne that also made landfall in the southeastern United States. In 2003, Hurricane Isabel and several storms across the United States accounted for the majority of the $352 million cost of catastrophes. The cost of catastrophes was included in the Companys business segments in the respective periods as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Commercial $ 1,240 $ 363 $ 103 Specialty 356 220 Personal 593 189 249 Total $ 2,189 $ 772 $ 352 The following table provides additional information regarding the components of the estimated cost recorded related to catastrophes in 2005. (for the year ended December 31, in millions) Gross loss and loss adjustment expenses $ 3,811 Reinstatement premiums 121 State assessments 43 Reinsurance recoverables (1,786 ) Total estimated pretax loss $ 2,189 Reinstatement premiums represent additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties and are recorded as a reduction of net written and earned premiums. After payment of these reinstatement premiums, the Company has coverage for one additional limit under its corporate catastrophe treaty and continuing protection under most of its other treaties. The term of the Companys current corporate catastrophe treaty expires on June 30, 2006. State assessments are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses. General and Administrative Expenses The $284 million increase in general and administrative expenses in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflected the impact of the merger. In addition, the 2005 total included $43 million of state assessments related to catastrophe losses, and also reflected investments made for process re engineering and to support business growth and product development, primarily in the Personal segment. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of expense efficiencies achieved since the completion of the merger. The Commercial segment in particular has realized significant expense savings since the completion of the merger primarily through the elimination of duplicate functions throughout the combined organization. Included in the 2005 and 2004 totals were $112 million and $92 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to finite lived intangible assets acquired in the merger, and a benefit of $12 million and $58 million, respectively, associated with the accretion of the fair value adjustment to claims and claim adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables. The 2004 total included a $62 million increase in the allowance for uncollectible amounts due from policyholders for loss sensitive business (primarily high deductible business). This increase resulted from applying the Companys credit based methodology for determining uncollectible amounts to the recoverables acquired in the merger. General and administrative expenses in 2004 also included $29 million of restructuring charges related to the merger. 61 Other 2004 Claims and Expenses. Other items increasing the 2004 claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $296 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables, policyholders receivables, and co surety participations on a specific construction contractor claim. The increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables recognized a change in estimated disputes with reinsurers and is based upon the Companys reinsurance strategy of reduced reinsurance utilization, including the cessation of ongoing business relationships with certain of SPCs reinsurers, and aggressive collection of reinsurance recoverables. A charge was also recorded to increase the estimated uncollectible amounts due from policyholders for loss sensitive business (primarily high deductible business). This increase recognized a change in estimated uncollectible amounts due and resulted from applying the Companys credit based methodology for determining uncollectible amounts to the recoverables acquired in the merger. Because reinsurance recoverables and amounts due from policyholders for loss sensitive business are insurance contract related assets, these assets are subject to the same types of estimation variables as loss reserves. Also during the second quarter of 2004, a participating co surety on a contract surety exposure announced that insurance regulators had approved its submitted run off plan. Based upon industry knowledge of the co suretys run off plan and an analysis of the co suretys financial condition, the Company concluded that it was unlikely to collect the full amount projected to be owed by the co surety and established an appropriate level of reserves. Interest Expense The $50 million increase in interest expense in 2005 over 2004 primarily reflected the impact of a full year of interest expense on SPC debt assumed in the merger on April 1, 2004. The Companys debt outstanding at December 31, 2005 declined by a net $463 million compared with year end 2004. In 2004, the $69 million increase in interest expense over 2003 reflected the incremental expense associated with SPC debt assumed in the merger. Effective Tax Rate The Companys effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 22.8%, 7.3% and 24.1% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 and 2003 effective rate reflected a higher level of pretax income associated with profitable underwriting performance. The low 2004 effective rate primarily reflected the impact of an increase in nontaxable investment income on a lower level of pretax income. GAAP combined ratios Catastrophe losses accounted for 10.3 points of the 2005 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, compared with 4.0 points in 2004. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2005 included a 1.6 point impact of net unfavorable prior year reserve development, whereas the 2004 ratio included a 12.6 point impact of net unfavorable prior year reserve development. The 2005 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio also reflected an improvement in current accident year non catastrophe loss experience, compared with 2004, primarily reflecting reduced claim activity. The 1.1 point increase in the 2005 underwriting expense ratio compared with 2004 reflected the impact of reinstatement premiums, state assessments, earned premium declines in the Commercial segment, increased commission expenses in the Personal segment and investments made for process re engineering and to support business growth and product development, primarily in the Personal segment. These factors were partially offset by expense efficiencies realized since the completion of the merger. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2004 included a 4.0 point impact from catastrophes and a 12.6 point impact from net unfavorable prior year reserve development. The respective impacts of these factors on the 2003 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio were 3.8 points and 2.8 points. The 2.7 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2004 primarily reflected the impact of higher underwriting expenses related to the business acquired in the merger, as well as expenses associated with the merger. 62 Discontinued Operations In March 2005, the Company and Nuveen Investments jointly announced that the Company would implement a program to divest its 78% equity interest in Nuveen Investments, which constituted the Companys Asset Management segment and was acquired as part of the merger on April 1, 2004. The divestiture was completed through a series of transactions in the second and third quarters of 2005, resulting in net pretax cash proceeds of $2.40 billion. The Company recorded a net operating loss from discontinued operations of $663 million in 2005, consisting primarily of $710 million of tax expense due to the difference between the tax basis and the GAAP carrying value of the Companys investment in Nuveen Investments, partially offset by the Companys share of Nuveen Investments net income prior to divestiture. The Company recorded a pretax gain on disposal of $345 million ($224 million after tax) in 2005. Income from discontinued operations of $88 million in 2004 represented the Companys share of Nuveen Investments net income for the year. The assets and liabilities related to Nuveen Investments were removed from the respective lines of the Companys consolidated balance sheet and reported under the caption Net assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. The current and deferred tax liabilities generated by the difference between the Companys tax basis and the GAAP basis of its investment in Nuveen Investments are reported on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as part of the Companys current and deferred tax liabilities. Renewal Rights Purchases During the third quarter of 2003, TPC purchased from Royal & SunAlliance USA (RSA), an unaffiliated insurer, the renewal rights to RSAs commercial lines national accounts, middle market and marine businesses, and standard and preferred personal lines businesses. Also during the third quarter of 2003, TPC purchased from Atlantic Mutual, an unaffiliated insurer, the renewal rights to the majority of Atlantic Mutuals commercial lines inland marine and ocean cargo businesses written by Atlantic Mutuals Marine Division. The total purchase price for these renewal rights transactions, which was based in part on the level of business renewed by the Company, was $69 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Commercial Results of the Companys Commercial segment were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Earned premiums $ 8,574 $ 8,816 $ 6,552 Net investment income 1,944 1,728 1,324 Fee income 629 680 545 Other revenues 55 55 33 Total revenues $ 11,202 $ 11,279 $ 8,454 Total claims and expenses $ 10,356 $ 10,350 $ 7,131 Operating income $ 756 $ 786 $ 1,061 Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 83.6 % 81.8 % 75.4 % Underwriting expense ratio 29.5 27.8 24.9 GAAP combined ratio 113.1 % 109.6 % 100.3 % Overview Operating income of $756 million in 2005 was 4% lower than operating income of $786 million in 2004, as the significant increase in the cost of catastrophes in 2005 was substantially offset by a decline in net unfavorable prior year reserve development and the impact of the merger. The cost of catastrophes totaled $1.24 billion in 2005, compared with $363 million in 2004. Catastrophes in both years were the result of the hurricanes described in the Consolidated Overview section herein. Net unfavorable prior year development totaled $694 million in 2005, compared with $1.34 billion in 2004. The totals in both years were primarily driven by charges to increase asbestos reserves. 63 Operating income of $786 million in 2004 declined $275 million, or 26%, from 2003. The decline was driven by net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $1.34 billion in 2004, primarily related to asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development totaled $676 million in 2003, primarily related to reserve strengthening in the Gulf operation due to a line of business that insured the residual values of leased vehicles. Operating income in 2004 also included $363 million for the cost of catastrophes, compared with $103 million in 2003. Earned Premiums The $242 million decline in earned premiums in 2005 compared with 2004 reflected a significant decline in runoff operations, where business is intentionally being non renewed, and a decline in ongoing operations due to a lower level of written premium volume in the last half of 2004 and first half of 2005. These declines were partially offset by the impact of the merger. In addition, the reinstatement premiums described in the Consolidated Overview section herein reduced net earned premium volume in 2005 by $52 million. In 2004, earned premium growth of $2.26 billion over 2003 was primarily due to the merger and also reflected the earned premium effect of moderating renewal price increases over the previous twelve months in the Companys ongoing Commercial business lines. In addition, incremental premiums resulting from the renewal rights transactions with Royal & SunAlliance and Atlantic Mutual in the third quarter of 2003 contributed to premium growth in 2004. Net Investment Income Refer to the Net Investment Income section of the Consolidated Results of Operations discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the increase in the Companys net investment income in 2005 and 2004. Fee Income National Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self insure a portion of their insurance risks, and claims and policy management services to workers compensation residual market pools, automobile assigned risk plans and to self insurance pools. The $51 million, or 8%, decline in fee income in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to increased competition, including the loss of several large customers in the second half of 2004 and in early 2005. The strong increase in 2004 fee income over 2003 reflected higher new business levels, resulting, in part, from the third quarter 2003 renewal rights transaction with Royal & SunAlliance, renewal price increases and more workers compensation business being written by state residual market pools. Claims and Expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2005 totaled $7.45 billion, compared with $7.52 billion in 2004. Included in those totals were $1.17 billion and $363 million, respectively, of catastrophe losses (net of reinsurance). Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the Commercial segment totaled $694 million in 2005, primarily due to charges to increase asbestos reserves by $830 million and environmental reserves by $30 million. That unfavorable development was partially offset by other net favorable prior year reserve development of $166 million, primarily in the commercial automobile, commercial multi peril, workers compensation and property lines of business. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development totaled $1.34 billion in 2004, which included a $927 million charge to strengthen asbestos reserves and a $286 million charge to strengthen environmental reserves. Also included in the net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2004 was a $157 million addition to the reserve for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables, $38 million from the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer and other net unfavorable prior year reserve development primarily concentrated in the Companys Gulf operations. Partially offsetting the impact of these reserve increases in 2004 was favorable prior year reserve development in core Commercial operations, which resulted from reductions in the frequency of non catastrophe related losses. The asbestos charge in 2005 resulted, in part, from higher than expected defense costs due to increased trial activity for seriously impaired plaintiffs and prolonged litigation before cases are settled or dismissed. The 2005 charge also considered the January 2006 court decision voiding, on procedural grounds, the previously rendered favorable arbitration decision in the ongoing ACandS litigation. The asbestos charge recorded in 2004 primarily resulted from an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants. With regard to environmental reserve additions, the 2005 charge was primarily related to declaratory judgment costs, whereas the significant 2004 charge was related to revised estimates of costs related to settlement initiatives. See the Asbestos Claims and Litigation and Environmental Claims and Litigation sections herein for further discussion of these reserves. 64 In 2003, net unfavorable prior year loss development in the Commercial segment totaled $676 million, the most significant component of which was $521 million of reserve strengthening in the Gulf operations. That reserve strengthening was primarily related to a line of business that insured the residual values of leased vehicles and that had been placed in runoff in late 2001, and the resolution of a residual value claim dispute. In addition, in 2003 the Company strengthened prior year reserves for certain runoff lines of business, including assumed reinsurance. Catastrophe losses in 2003 totaled $103 million. General and administrative expenses in 2005 totaled $1.65 billion, an increase of 5% over the 2004 total of $1.58 billion, which primarily reflected the impact of the merger. The 2004 total included merger related charges and charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from policyholders receivables. The Commercial segment has realized significant expense savings since the completion of the merger primarily through the elimination of duplicate functions throughout the combined operation. GAAP Combined Ratio The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2005 included a 14.0 point impact from catastrophe losses, compared with a 4.1 point impact from catastrophe losses in 2004. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development accounted for 8.1 points and 15.3 points, respectively, of the 2005 and 2004 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios. Excluding these factors from both years, the adjusted 2005 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 0.9 points less than the comparable 2004 adjusted ratio, reflecting the improvement in current accident year loss experience compared with 2004. The adjusted 2004 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.1 points better than the 2003 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio adjusted to exclude prior year reserve development and catastrophes, primarily driven by a reduction in non catastrophe weather related losses during the year. The underwriting expense ratio in 2005 was 1.7 points higher than 2004, primarily reflecting the significant earned premium declines described previously, and the 0.4 point negative impact of the $52 million in reinstatement premiums and $18 million of catastrophe related state assessments. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of merger related expense savings throughout the segment and personnel reductions in the Commercial Other sector. The 2004 underwriting expense ratio included the impact of merger related restructuring charges and an increase in the allowance for uncollectible amounts due from policyholders. The 2.9 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily reflected the impact of the higher underwriting expense ratio of business in runoff (some of which was acquired in the merger), the merger related restructuring charges and the increase in the allowance for uncollectible amounts due from policyholders. Written Premiums The Commercial segments gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (for the year ended December 31, in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Commercial Accounts $ 4,852 $ 4,386 $ 4,648 $ 4,210 $ 3,593 $ 3,251 Select Accounts 2,799 2,722 2,631 2,555 2,105 2,047 National Accounts 2,627 1,230 2,410 1,040 1,462 831 Total Commercial Core 10,278 8,338 9,689 7,805 7,160 6,129 Commercial Other 148 91 947 506 1,508 733 Total Commercial $ 10,426 $ 8,429 $ 10,636 $ 8,311 $ 8,668 $ 6,862 In Commercial Core operations, gross and net written premiums increased 6% and 7% over 2004 totals, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. However, 2005 written premium volume in Commercial Core operations declined when compared with 2004 on a pro forma combined basis, due to increasing competition in the marketplace and pricing levels that were flat with 2004. Business retention levels throughout the Core Commercial operations, however, increased over 2004, and new business levels improved over 2004. Net written premiums in 2005 for Commercial Core operations were reduced by the $52 million of reinstatement premiums related to catastrophe losses described in the Consolidated Overview section herein. In Commercial Other operations, gross and net written premiums declined 84% and 82%, respectively, from the comparable 2004 totals, reflecting the intentional non renewal of business in the runoff operations comprising this category. 65 Commercials gross and net written premiums in 2004 increased 23% and 21%, respectively, over the 2003 totals, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. New business volume in 2004 declined when compared with the combined new business volume of SPC and TPC in 2003, reflecting the increasingly competitive marketplace and the impact of higher premium flow in 2003 associated with several renewal rights transactions. In the Commercial Accounts market, net written premiums of $4.39 billion grew $176 million, or 4%, over 2004 volume of $4.21 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. However, 2005 written premium declined from 2004 on a pro forma combined basis. Business retention levels in this market in 2005 increased over 2004 and were at historically high levels for the year. New business volume also grew over 2004. Renewal price changes in 2005 in Commercial Accounts declined from 2004 and were modestly negative for the year, reflecting the increased competitive market conditions. Commercial Accounts net premium volume in 2004 grew $959 million, or 29%, over 2003 volume of $3.25 billion, primarily due to the merger. Retention rates in 2004 were strong and renewal price change increases were essentially flat by the end of the year. New business levels were lower during the second half of 2004 as the benefit from the Atlantic Mutual and Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transactions entered into in the third quarter of 2003 diminished in the second half of the year. In the Select Accounts market, net written premiums in 2005 grew 7% over 2004, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. However, 2005 written premium declined from 2004 on a pro forma combined basis. Business retention levels in 2005 increased over 2004 as the year progressed and were also at historically high levels for the year in total. Renewal price changes in Select Accounts in 2005 were in the low single digit range for the year, which was lower than renewal price increases in 2004. New business levels in Select Accounts declined slightly from 2004. Select Accounts 2004 premium volume of $2.56 billion increased $508 million, or 25%, over 2003, reflecting the impact of the merger. Overall retention levels were strong and renewal price increases moderated to the mid single digits in 2004. Retention and growth in 2004 reflected the Companys competitive advantage in agency automation, product offerings and service to agents in this high transaction volume business. In National Accounts, gross written premiums in 2005 grew 9% over 2004, and net written premiums grew $190 million, or 18%, compared with 2004, which reflected the impact of the merger and changes in Discover Res reinsurance program. The 25% increase in National Accounts net premium volume in 2004 over 2003 reflected new business from the third quarter 2003 Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction and higher business volumes in residual market pools, the impacts of which were partially offset by a shift to deductible and fee based products by some of the Companys clients. During 2005, results of the Companys Discover Re operation were reclassified from the Specialty segment to National Accounts in the Commercial segment. All prior period amounts were reclassified to be consistent with the 2005 presentation. In Commercial Other, the 82% and 31% declines in 2005 and 2004 net premium volume, respectively, compared with the respective prior years reflected the intentional non renewal of business in the runoff operations comprising this category (primarily Gulf). Certain business previously written by Gulf is now being written elsewhere in the Commercial or Specialty segments. The runoff healthcare, reinsurance and international business acquired in the merger produced minimal written premium volume in 2005 and 2004. In 2003, Commercial Other consisted primarily of results from the Gulf operation, which marketed products to national, mid sized and small customers and distributed them through both wholesale brokers and retail agents and brokers throughout the United States with particular emphasis on management and professional liability coverages and excess and surplus lines of insurance. 66 Specialty Results of the Companys Specialty segment were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Earned premiums $ 5,739 $ 4,642 $ 1,171 Net investment income 757 487 183 Fee income 35 26 15 Other revenues 29 22 8 Total revenues $ 6,560 $ 5,177 $ 1,377 Total claims and expenses $ 5,573 $ 6,231 $ 1,048 Operating income (loss) $ 679 $ (648 ) $ 234 Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 64.6 % 100.1 % 51.3 % Underwriting expense ratio 31.8 33.5 36.0 GAAP combined ratio 96.4 % 133.6 % 87.3 % The Specialty segments results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 reflect the results of TPCs Bond and Construction operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the post merger results of SPCs specialty operations, including SPCs Bond and Construction operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Results for 2003 represent TPCs Bond and Construction operations only. Overview Operating income of $679 million in 2005 improved by $1.33 billion over the operating loss of $648 million in 2004. The significant improvement in 2005 operating income reflected the absence of net unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as strong net investment income, improved current accident year results in several domestic businesses (particularly Bond) and lower commission expenses in certain business units. Operating results in 2005 included a cost of catastrophes of $356 million (net of reinsurance and including reinstatement premiums), compared with $220 million of such costs in 2004. The operating loss of $648 million in 2004 was driven by net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $1.43 billion, including significant charges related to the construction and surety reserves acquired in the merger, as well as other reserving actions that are described in the narrative that follows. Operating results in 2004 also included $220 million for the cost of catastrophes resulting from the four hurricanes described previously, whereas 2003 results included no catastrophe losses. Earned Premiums Earned premiums in 2005 increased $1.10 billion, or 24%, over 2004, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. Earned premiums in 2005 were reduced by the $48 million in reinstatement premiums related to the hurricane losses described in the Consolidated Overview section herein. Earned premiums in 2005 also reflected the inclusion of one additional month of premium volume totaling $37 million to eliminate a reporting lag at the Companys operations at Lloyds, the impact of which was partially offset by the sale of certain classes of personal insurance business at those Lloyds operations. Earned premiums in 2004 were reduced by $76 million of reinstatement premiums primarily related to a reserve charge in the Companys Bond operation. Earned premiums of $4.64 billion in 2004 grew $3.47 billion over 2003, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger Net Investment Income Refer to the Net Investment Income section of the Consolidated Results of Operations discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the increase in the Companys net investment income in 2005 and 2004. 67 Claims and Expenses Claims and claims adjustment expenses in 2005 included $308 million of current year catastrophe losses, compared with catastrophe losses of $209 million recorded in 2004. Catastrophe losses in both periods were driven by the hurricanes described in the Consolidated Overview section herein. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2005 totaled $9 million, as favorable development in International operations was largely offset by unfavorable development related to 2004 hurricane losses in the Personal Catastrophe Risk operation. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development totaled $1.43 billion in 2004, which included charges to increase the estimate of the acquired net construction reserves by $500 million and the acquired net surety reserves in the Companys Bond operation by $300 million, as well as a $252 million charge related to the financial condition of a construction contractor. The following discussion provides more information regarding the net unfavorable prior year loss development related to these items in 2004, as well as other reserving actions. Upon having access to each companys detailed policyholder information, including underwriting, claim, and actuarial files on April 1, 2004, in connection with the closing of the merger, the Company was able to begin the detailed process of developing a uniform and consistent approach to estimating the combined companys loss reserves. As part of that process, a team of actuaries representing the historical actuarial perspectives, judgments and methods applied by each legacy company, discussed their views, methodologies, and analysis of available data. In addition to the discussion in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this report, other items specifically considered in the process of developing a uniform and consistent approach to estimating the combined companys loss reserves after the merger included interpreting the actuarial and claim data in a uniform manner and determining an appropriate level of data segmentation for estimation purposes. This type of analysis involves a high degree of judgment and can, and often does, lead to reserve estimates that differ materially from those of prior periods, particularly in low frequency, high severity and complex exposures. In addition, since the reserving process also considers the expectations of future outcomes, the actuaries involved had to analyze their differing views on key assumptions, such as predicting inflation, estimating claim development patterns and determining expectations related to judicial rulings and interpretations, among others. This informed judgment is brought into the process by individuals such as actuaries, underwriters, claim adjusters, and company management. Ultimately, this process required an analysis of the varying actuarial judgments and forward looking assessments. The result was similar to a single, ongoing insurance enterprise obtaining more information in a reporting period than it had previously and identifying a change in estimate in its insurance reserves in that period. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $500 million and $300 million charge for construction and surety, respectively, in the second quarter of 2004. Construction Reserves. Beginning on April 1, 2004, upon the completion of the merger, personnel from the predecessor companies were able to share detailed policyholder information, claim files and actuarial data related to the acquired construction reserves. This enabled an analysis to be performed in the second quarter of the acquired construction reserves using TPCs long established practices that includes evaluating exposures by type of claim (e.g. construction defect, construction wrap up, other), by type of coverage (e.g. guaranteed cost, loss responsive, other) and by detailed line of business (general liability, commercial auto, etc.), among others. For general liability exposures, which include construction defect and construction wrap up, interpretation of underlying trends (both present and future) and the related reserve estimation process is highly judgmental due to the low frequency/high severity and complex nature of these exposures. In particular, for construction defect, there is a high degree of uncertainty relating to whether coverage exists, when losses occur, the size of each loss, expectations for future interpretive rulings concerning contract provisions and the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. As a result, material variations can and do occur among actuarial reserve estimates for these types of exposures. In a merger, these differences are likely to be even more pronounced. Prior to a merger, each legacy company consistently applies its assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods to estimate reserves. Differences between these assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods need to be understood and reconciled, and a uniform approach needs to be adopted for the merged entity. In this situation, material adjustments can and do occur for reserves related to exposures having a high degree of uncertainty. Analysis of the acquired construction reserves was completed near the end of the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the results of this analysis, the Company increased its estimate of the acquired net construction reserves by $500 million, including $400 million for construction defect and $100 million for construction wrap up claims, and recognized this change in estimate as an income statement charge in the second quarter. There was no reinsurance associated with this charge. 68 Surety Reserves. Personnel from the predecessor companies were also able to share detailed SPC policyholder information related to surety reserves upon completion of the merger. Access to this detailed information enabled the Company to perform a claim by claim review of reserves and claims handling strategies during the second quarter of 2004 using the combined expertise of claims adjusters from the legacy companies. This type of review involves considerable judgment, especially with respect to the economic outlook within which claims will be settled, estimates for dates of loss occurrence and evaluations of IBNR exposures for each insured. For example, as a result of the detailed information obtained concerning contractors with reported claims, the Company considered whether or not losses were incurred but not yet reported on one or more additional projects for each contractor examined. Also on April 1, 2004, the Company could begin to use this detailed information to compare SPCs assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods that were underlying the acquired reserves with its own assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods. Similarities and differences were found to exist. Similarities included, but were not limited to, recognizing claim reserves when it was determined that contractors and commercial surety insureds were in default and thereby unable to meet their obligations, estimating initial IBNR provisions, and periodically re evaluating, at least quarterly, the adequacy of the reserves established based on actual claims recorded and revised estimates of IBNR. Differences included judgments and methods related to determining IBNR development factors and expected salvage, among others. That these differences exist is not unusual for surety reserve estimates. Surety is a line of business for which there are low frequency, high severity, very complex claims for certain exposures, particularly those related to large construction contractors and commercial surety insureds. Determining the date of loss in these circumstances requires a high degree of judgment. In addition, the claim reserve estimates even for reported claims are also highly judgmental. These two factors, among others, combine to make IBNR reserve estimations for surety extremely difficult. Due to this high degree of uncertainty, the informed judgments of different actuaries could and do vary materially. As discussed above, in a merger, these differences are likely to be even more pronounced. The claim reviews and actuarial analyses were both completed near the end of the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the results of these reviews and analyses, the Company increased its estimate of the acquired surety reserves by $300 million, net of $170 million of reinsurance, and recognized this change in estimate as an income statement charge in the second quarter. Other Reserving Actions. Prior to the merger and beginning in the third quarter of 2003, SPC disclosed that a large construction contractor for which it had written several surety bonds was experiencing financial difficulty. Based upon an analysis of the financial condition of the construction contractor that was performed in the third quarter of 2003, a restructuring plan was adopted by the construction contractor, its banks, and SPC, among others, as a means to minimize estimated losses. SPC monitored the progress of the construction contractor toward meeting the requirements of the restructuring plan throughout subsequent quarters. SPC also estimated and disclosed its estimated ultimate net losses related to this exposure, beginning in the third quarter of 2003 and updated each quarter thereafter, including the effects of advances made or expected to be made to the construction contractor, applicable collateral, co surety participations and reinsurance. The size and complexity of these particular construction contracts, coupled with the deteriorating credit quality of the construction contractor and the inherent uncertainty as to whether it would meet the obligations of the restructuring plan, resulted in a high degree of judgment in estimating potential losses. A comprehensive analysis that began in the first quarter of 2004 was completed during the last half of the second quarter. Based upon this analysis, the Company concluded that the contractor would not be able to meet the targets set forth in its business and restructuring plans. Therefore, the Company moved from supporting the contractors restructuring plan to adopting a workout plan as a means to minimize estimated losses. Under the workout plan, the Company would no longer provide additional surety bonds for new projects of the construction contractor. Also as part of the workout plan, the Company was able to implement additional accounting and engineering procedures for each open project, which included using specialists to implement additional forecasting, cash management, and reporting procedures, on both a project by project and consolidated level. Based upon this second quarter change to a workout plan and the detailed financial analysis that was able to be performed, the Company increased its estimate of the ultimate net loss by $252 million, including $9 million of reinsurance. This estimate took into consideration paid amounts, net receivables, liquidated damages, overhead costs, additional completion costs, including costs associated with replacing the contractor, receivable discounts, current and future claims from owners and subcontractors against the contractor, and the value of collateral, among others. 69 Also during the last half of the second quarter of 2004, a participating co surety on this exposure announced that insurance regulators had approved its submitted run off plan. Based upon industrys knowledge of the co suretys run off plan and the Companys analysis of its financial condition, the Company concluded that it was unlikely to collect the full amount projected to be owed by the co surety and established an appropriate level of reserves. In the second quarter of 2005, the Company reached a settlement with the co surety whereby the co surety made a payment to the Company and was released from further financial obligations to the Company in connection with the specific construction exposure. The settlement payment, coupled with the previously established co surety reserves, approximated the current estimate of the co suretys share of the bonded losses related to this exposure. Claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 included $209 million of catastrophe losses, compared with no such losses in 2003. Results in 2004 also reflected increased current year loss ratios on portions of the Bond and Construction books of business, and $150 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development recorded in TPCs Construction operation prior to the merger. General and administrative expenses in 2005 totaled $893 million, an increase of 15% over the 2004 total of $779 million which primarily reflected the impact of the merger. The 2005 total included the impacts of a decline in commission expenses and expense efficiencies realized as a result of the merger. In 2004, general and administrative expenses of $779 million were significantly higher than the 2003 total of $222 million, reflecting the impact of the merger. Other items increasing 2004 claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $217 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables, policyholders receivables, and the co surety on a specific construction contractor claim described above. GAAP Combined Ratio The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2005 included a 5.8 point impact from catastrophe losses, whereas the comparable 2004 ratio included a 4.6 point impact from catastrophe losses. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2005 also included a 0.1 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development, whereas the comparable 2004 ratio impact from net unfavorable prior year reserve development totaled 30.8 points. Excluding both factors in each year, the 2005 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved over the 2004 ratio, reflecting the significant improvement in current year loss experience in 2005. The impact of prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses in 2003 was negligible. The 2005 underwriting expense ratio improved 1.7 points compared with 2004, reflecting the impact of the merger and expense efficiencies realized since the completion of the merger. The 2004 underwriting expense ratio was also negatively impacted by an increase to the allowance for estimated amounts due from policyholder receivables and merger related restructuring costs. Written Premiums Specialty gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (for the year ended December 31, in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Bond $ 1,572 $ 1,267 $ 1,438 $ 1,183 $ 940 $ 781 Construction 925 916 854 844 487 474 Financial and Professional Services 959 850 664 636 Other 1,991 1,605 1,455 1,186 Total Domestic Specialty 5,447 4,638 4,411 3,849 1,427 1,255 International Specialty 1,389 1,091 1,100 922 30 3 Total Specialty $ 6,836 $ 5,729 $ 5,511 $ 4,771 $ 1,457 $ 1,258 70 Gross and net written premiums in 2005 increased 24% and 20%, respectively, over written premium volume in 2004. The increase in gross and net written premiums in 2005 primarily reflected the impact of the merger. Net written premiums in 2005 were reduced by $48 million of reinstatement premiums related to catastrophe losses that are described in more detail in the Consolidated Overview section herein, whereas net written premiums in 2004 were reduced by $76 million of reinstatement premiums primarily related to reserving actions in the Bond operation. Gross written premiums in 2005 were level, and net written premiums were down 2%, compared with 2004 volume on a pro forma combined basis. Contributing to the decline in net written premiums were the sale of certain credit related personal lines classes of business previously written at the Companys operations at Lloyds, and lower business volumes in Construction related to the now completed process of aligning the underwriting profile of the two predecessor companies. These declines were partially offset by premium growth in the Financial and Professional Services and several other Domestic Specialty businesses. In addition, the elimination of a reporting lag at the Companys operations at Lloyds resulted in $35 million and $28 million of additional gross and net written premium volume in 2005, respectively. Bond net written premiums in 2005 were level with the 2004 pro forma combined premium volume (excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums in 2004). In 2005, approximately $114 million of gross written premiums previously written in the Companys Gulf operation in the Commercial segment were written in Financial and Professional Services, compared with $90 million of gross written premiums in 2004. In Domestic Specialty operations, and International Specialty operations excluding Lloyds, business retention levels in 2005 were higher than in 2004. New business levels in Domestic Specialty operations were also higher than in 2004. In International Specialty operations excluding Lloyds, new business levels in 2005 were lower than in 2004. Renewal price changes in Domestic Specialty operations, while still positive, were down from 2004. As discussed previously, in the first quarter of 2005, the Company implemented changes in the timing and structure of reinsurance purchased in the Specialty segment. Those changes resulted in a slight increase in ceded premiums in 2005 over what would have been ceded prior to the changes being implemented. The $3.51 billion increase in net written premium volume in 2004 over 2003 reflected the impact of the merger. However, the repositioning of the Bond and Construction books of business primarily accounted for a decline in net written premium volume in 2004 compared with the 2003 pro forma combined premium volume of SPC and TPC. In Construction, that repositioning resulted in reduced retention levels when compared with 2003, and new business levels also declined substantially. In Bond, the repositioning of the book of business was primarily centered in the SPC business acquired in the merger. Net written premiums in 2004 in the majority of the Companys remaining Domestic Specialty businesses were strong, with retention levels at or above historical levels. Renewal price change increases in these operations moderated throughout the year to the upper single digit level. New business levels in 2004 were down compared with 2003, when renewal rights transactions contributed to strong growth in new business. The impact of the decline in new business levels in 2004 was partially offset by premium growth resulting from the transfer of certain business from the Companys Gulf operation, which was placed in runoff in the second quarter of the year. In International Specialty, business retention levels in 2004 (excluding Lloyds) were strong relative to pre merger levels, and new business levels were consistent with the pre merger levels in 2003. In 2004, the Company continued its focus on retaining its profitable book of existing International Specialty business. At Lloyds, premium volume in 2004 was negatively impacted by the non renewal of certain credit related personal lines insurance coverages. 71 Personal Results of the Companys Personal segment were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Earned premiums $ 6,028 $ 5,580 $ 4,822 Net investment income 457 442 361 Other revenues 96 91 85 Total revenues $ 6,581 $ 6,113 $ 5,268 Total claims and expenses $ 5,464 $ 4,732 $ 4,555 Operating income $ 775 $ 939 $ 492 Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 62.2 % 58.3 % 69.1 % Underwriting expense ratio 26.9 24.9 23.7 GAAP combined ratio 89.1 % 83.2 % 92.8 % Overview Operating income of $775 million in 2005 was $164 million lower than operating income of $939 million in 2004, largely due to the $593 million cost of catastrophes primarily resulting from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005, which are discussed in more detail in the Consolidated Overview section herein. The cost of catastrophes in 2004 totaled $189 million, the majority of which resulted from four hurricanes that struck the southeastern United States. The Personal segment in 2005 benefited from continued low non catastrophe frequency levels, net favorable prior year reserve development of $360 million and strong net investment income levels. In 2004, the $447 million increase in operating income over 2003 was driven by low non catastrophe frequency levels, particularly in the property line, strong premium growth resulting from unit growth and price increases, and $378 million of net favorable prior year reserve development. Net favorable prior year development in 2003 totaled $212 million. Earned Premiums Earned premiums of $6.03 billion in 2005 increased $448 million, or 8%, over 2004 earned premiums of $5.58 billion, reflecting continued strong business retention levels, new business volumes and renewal price increases over the prior twelve months. Earned premiums in 2005 were reduced by $21 million of reinstatement premiums described in the Consolidated Overview section herein. The $758 million, or 16%, growth in earned premiums in 2004 over 2003 was primarily due to an increase in organic new business volume, new business associated with the Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction entered into in the third quarter of 2003, strong business retention levels and renewal price increases over the prior twelve months. Net Investment Income Refer to the Net Investment Income section of the Consolidated Results of Operations discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the increase in the Companys net investment income in 2005 and 2004. Claims and Expenses Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2005 included catastrophe losses of $547 million, compared with catastrophe losses of $189 million in 2004. Catastrophe losses in both years were primarily driven by the hurricanes described in the Consolidated Overview section herein. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2005 was $360 million, compared with net favorable prior year reserve development of $378 million in 2004. The favorable prior year development in 2005 and 2004 was primarily driven by further declines in the frequency of non catastrophe losses and lower than expected severity resulting from recent claim initiatives. The favorable development in both years also reflected the recognition of lower current accident year frequency of non catastrophe related claims in the Homeowners and Other line of business and an improvement in frequency trends in the Automobile line of business. 72 Catastrophe losses in 2004 of $189 million were $60 million less than the 2003 catastrophe loss total of $249 million. The 2003 losses resulted from a variety of storms across the United States, including Hurricane Isabel in the third quarter of the year and wildfires in California. Favorable prior year reserve development of $378 million in 2004 was significantly higher than favorable prior year development of $212 million in 2003. The favorable 2003 development was also primarily due to lower than expected frequency of non catastrophe related homeowners losses. The 2003 total also included a $50 million reduction in losses resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. General and administrative expenses totaled $665 million in 2005, $536 million in 2004 and $420 million in 2003. The 2005 total included $25 million of catastrophe related assessments. The increases in both 2005 and 2004 reflected business growth and agent profit sharing expenses related to profitable underwriting results. In addition, the increases in both years reflected investments in personnel, technology and infrastructure to support business growth, and continued process re engineering pilots targeted to reduce loss severity. GAAP Combined Ratio The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2005 included a 9.3 point impact from catastrophe losses, whereas the comparable 2004 ratio included a 3.4 point impact from catastrophe losses. The impact from net favorable prior year reserve development in 2005 was 6.0 points, compared with 6.8 points in 2004. Excluding the impact of these factors in both years, the 2005 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 2.8 points better than the 2004 ratio, reflecting improvement in current accident year non catastrophe loss experience. The 2003 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 69.1 included a 5.2 point impact of catastrophe losses and a 4.4 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development. Excluding these factors from both 2004 and 2003, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2004 improved significantly over 2003, reflecting the earned impact of price increases that continued to exceed loss cost trends and improvement in non catastrophe loss frequency. The 2.0 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2005 compared with 2004 reflected an increase in commission expenses, other insurance expenses, and taxes, licenses and fees. The increase in commissions reflected a changing product mix and higher agent profit sharing expenses. The increase in other insurance expenses reflected the impact of continued process re engineering investments and investments in personnel, technology and infrastructure to support business growth and product development. In addition, reinstatement premiums related to the catastrophe losses reduced earned premium volume by $21 million in 2005, and catastrophe related assessments from various insurance pools increased taxes, licenses and fees by $25 million. These factors combined to result in a 0.5 point negative impact on the Personal segments 2005 underwriting expense ratio. In 2004, the 1.2 increase in the underwriting expense ratio over 2003 reflected the impact of the same investments described above. Written Premiums Personal gross and net written premiums by product line were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (for the year ended December 31, in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Automobile $ 3,526 $ 3,477 $ 3,470 $ 3,433 $ 3,092 $ 3,054 Homeowners and Other 2,948 2,751 2,641 2,496 2,153 2,027 Total Personal $ 6,474 $ 6,228 $ 6,111 $ 5,929 $ 5,245 $ 5,081 Gross and net written premiums in 2005 increased 6% and 5%, respectively, over 2004. Growth in 2005 was concentrated in the Homeowners and Other product line, driven by continued renewal price increases and unit growth. Retention levels in both the Automobile and Homeowners and Other lines of business remained strong, and were consistent with 2004. In the Automobile line, renewal price increases in 2005 remained positive, but declined when compared with 2004. However, new business premiums in 2005 in the Automobile line increased over 2004, primarily due to the introduction of the Companys new multivariate pricing product in selected states. Net written premiums in 2005 were reduced by $21 million of catastrophe related reinstatement premiums described in the Consolidated Overview section herein. 73 Gross and net written premiums in 2004 increased 17% over 2003. Both Automobile and Homeowners and other net written premiums increased in 2004 due to higher new business volumes, the impact of new business associated with the Royal & SunAlliance renewal rights transaction entered into in the third quarter of 2003, continued strong retention, and renewal price increases. The Personal segment had approximately 6.6 million and 6.3 million policies in force at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the Automobile line of business, policies in force at December 31, 2005 increased 4% over the same date in 2004. Policies in force in the Homeowners and Other line of business at December 31, 2005 grew by 5% over the same date in 2004. Effective in the first quarter of 2005, Homeowners and Other policies in force include certain endorsements that had previously not been counted as separate policies. Prior year periods were restated to conform to the current year presentation. In the Automobile line of business, policies in force at December 31, 2004 increased 9% over 2003. Policies in force in the Homeowners and Other line of business at December 31, 2004 increased by 15% over 2003. Interest Expense and Other (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net loss $ (184 ) $ (182 ) $ (112 ) The increase in net loss for Interest Expense and Other for 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to incremental interest expense on debt assumed in the merger and a reduction in net investment income, which were mostly offset by the absence of non recurring merger related charges and a reduction in non interest related other expenses in 2005. The net loss for Interest Expense and Other for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $70 million compared with 2003, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. Included in the increase was $46 million of incremental interest expense on debt assumed in the merger. The 2004 total also included $9 million of charges related to the merger that were recorded in the second quarter. ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have attempted to expand insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the intent of insurers and policyholders. As a result, the Company continues to experience a significant number of asbestos claims being tendered to the Company by the Companys policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy), including claims against the Companys policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure. Factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants, the focus by plaintiffs on new and previously peripheral defendants and entities seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities. In addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. Bankruptcy proceedings are also causing increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system. Recently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation have their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. This trend, along with the focus on new and previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the loss and loss expense payments experienced by the Company. In addition, the Companys asbestos related loss and loss expense experience is impacted by the exhaustion or unavailability due to insolvency of other insurance potentially available to policyholders along with the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants. The Company is currently involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders who have filed for bankruptcy, including, among others, ACandS, Inc., who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage as described generally in the next paragraph. (Also see Part I Item 3, Legal Proceedings). These trends are expected to continue in the near term. As a result of the factors described above, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims. 74 In some instances, policyholders continue to assert that their claims for asbestos related insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage and that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues or whether the Company will be successful in asserting additional defenses. To the extent both issues are resolved in policyholders favor and other additional Company defenses are not successful, the Companys coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict the ultimate cost of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. In addition, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, challenging insurers conduct in respect of asbestos claims, and, as discussed below, claims by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos related bodily injuries. The Company anticipates the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, TPC has entered into settlement agreements, which have been approved by the court in connection with the proceedings initiated by TPC in the Johns Manville bankruptcy court. If the rulings of the bankruptcy court are affirmed through the appellate process, then TPC will have resolved substantially all of the direct action pending claims against it. (Also, see Part I Item 3, Legal Proceedings). Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder on a policyholder by policyholder basis. In the course of this review, the Company considers, among other factors: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of each policyholders potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non asbestos claims or potential non asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. When an estimate of the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and related claim adjustment expense is determined for a policyholder, the Company calculates, by each policy year, a ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, past ceded experience and reinsurance collections. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves. The Companys evaluations have not resulted in any data from which a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment may be determined. The Company also compares its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Net asbestos losses and expenses paid in 2005 were $399 million, compared with $301 million in 2004. This increase was primarily driven by inclusion of the SPC business for the full year in 2005 and substantial reinsurance recoveries in the third quarter of 2004. Approximately 42% in 2005 and 22% in 2004 of total net paid losses relate to policyholders with whom the Company previously entered into settlement agreements limiting the Companys liability. The lower percentage experienced in 2004 reflected substantial reinsurance billings during the year. In 2005, gross payments associated with policyholders with settlement agreements totaled $203 million, compared with $199 million in 2004. At December 31, 2005, net asbestos reserves totaled $4.36 billion, compared with $3.93 billion at December 31, 2004. The Companys annual ground up review of asbestos exposures resulted in a reserve increase of $830 million in 2005. In 2004, the Company increased asbestos reserves by $922 million following the same ground up review process. Those reviews included an analysis of exposures and payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The asbestos charge in 2005 resulted, in part, from higher than expected defense costs due to increased trial activity for seriously impaired plaintiffs and prolonged litigation before cases are settled or dismissed. The 2005 charge also considered the January 2006 court decision voiding, on procedural grounds, the previously rendered favorable arbitration decision in the ongoing ACandS litigation. The asbestos charge recorded in 2004 primarily resulted from an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants. 75 The Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows: Number of Policyholders Total Net Paid Net Asbestos Reserves (at and for the year ended December 31, $ in millions) 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 Policyholders with settlement agreements 28 29 $ 169 $ 67 $ 1,357 $ 1,431 Home office, field office and other 1,748 1,921 172 210 2,483 1,975 Assumed reinsurance and International 58 24 524 526 Total 1,776 1,950 $ 399 $ 301 $ 4,364 $ 3,932 The policyholders with settlement agreements category includes structured agreements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts and the settlement of the Statutory and Hawaii Actions and the Common Law Claims (for a fuller description of these matters, see Item 3 Legal Proceedings) (collectively the Direct Action Settlement). Reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured agreements are arrangements under which policyholders and or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. Structured agreements include the Companys obligations related to PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG). In May 2002 the Company agreed along with approximately three dozen other insurers and PPG on key terms to settle asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG. This settlement is to be incorporated into the Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) proposed as part of the Pittsburgh Corning (PC) bankruptcy proceeding. There remain a number of contingencies to consummation of the settlement including the final execution of documents, court approval of the PC Plan over pending objections, approval of the settlement and possible appeals. Pursuant to the proposed PC Plan, PC along with enumerated affiliated companies (including PPG and Corning) are to receive the protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos related bodily injury claims. A recent ruling by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in the In Re Combustion Engineering, Inc. (CE) matter may impact the scope of relief that is potentially available to the debtor and other Plan proponents. As a result, the PC bankruptcy court has sought additional briefing on the impact of the CE decision on the proposed PC Plan. The Company cannot predict what effect the CE decision may have with respect to the bankruptcy courts approval of the current Plan. A hearing is scheduled to be held on February 28, 2006 before the bankruptcy court. It is not possible to predict how or when the bankruptcy court will rule on the outstanding objections or how an appellate court may rule in the event of an appeal. It is possible that the Companys single payment contribution pursuant to the proposed settlement of approximately $404 million after reinsurance will be made in calendar year 2006. Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with major policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. As more fully described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, TPC has entered into the Direct Action Settlement which is still subject to a number of contingencies. If those contingencies are met, then TPC will pay up to $502 million, possibly in calendar year 2006. One of the contingencies includes affirmance by all appellate courts of the orders entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Direct Action Settlement. It is not possible to predict how or when the appellate courts will rule on the pending appeals. Home office, field office and other relates to policyholders for which settlement agreements have not been reached, and also includes unallocated IBNR. Policyholders are identified for home office review based upon, among other factors: aggregate ultimate expected payments in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential non product exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. In addition to incurred but not reported (IBNR) amounts contained in the reserves for home office and field office policyholders, the Company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders, new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation and direct actions against the Company. 76 Assumed reinsurance exposure primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations. The Companys international operations are exposed to U.S. asbestos liabilities through participations in excess insurance policies, quota share and excess of loss reinsurance policies, and retrocession policies, underwritten in the London insurance market. Details of exposures under the reinsurance and retrocession policies are identified only when the Company is advised by the retrocedant. The following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves: (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Beginning reserves: Direct $ 4,775 $ 3,782 $ 4,287 Ceded (843 ) (805 ) (883 ) Net 3,932 2,977 3,404 Reserves acquired: Direct 502 Ceded (191 ) Net 311 Incurred losses and loss expenses: Direct 833 941 Ceded (3 ) (13 ) Net 830 928 Accretion of discount: Direct 1 17 25 Ceded Net 1 17 25 Losses paid: Direct 506 467 530 Ceded (107 ) (166 ) (78 ) Net 399 301 452 Ending reserves: Direct 5,103 4,775 3,782 Ceded (739 ) (843 ) (805 ) Net $ 4,364 $ 3,932 $ 2,977 See Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION The Company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several with other responsible parties. 77 The Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid 1970s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount. At December 31, 2005, approximately 75% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $318 million) is carried in a bulk reserve and includes unresolved environmental claims and incurred but not reported environmental claims as well as for the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in process environmental claims and the Companys experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 25% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $107 million), consists of case reserves. The resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder by policyholder basis as opposed to a claim by claim basis. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy back of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any future liability arising from known specified sites or claims. Provisions of these agreements also include appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Companys general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Companys potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs. In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the allegations of environmental harm at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non environmental claims or potential non environmental claims, in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves. In its review of environmental reserves, the Company considers: the adequacy of reserves for past settlements; changing judicial and legislative trends; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean up action for both on and off site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development and additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements. Based on these trends, developments and management judgment, the Company increased its IBNR reserves accordingly. In 2004, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $290 million, net of reinsurance, to increase environmental reserves due to revised estimates of costs related to recent settlement initiatives. In 2005, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $30 million, net of reinsurance, primarily for declaratory judgment costs. The duration of the Companys investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim to claim and policyholder by policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. However, based upon the Companys experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years. 78 The Companys review of policyholders tendering claims for the first time has indicated that they are lower in severity. These policyholders generally present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, regulatory agencies are utilizing risk based analysis and more efficient clean up technologies. However, the Company has experienced an increase in the anticipated settlement amounts of certain matters as well as an increase in loss adjustment expenses. There also have been judicial interpretations that, in some cases, have been unfavorable to the industry and the Company. Gross paid losses were $248 million and $200 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in payments over 2004 was due to the inclusion of the SPC business for the entire period in 2005 and a significant settlement with one policyholder in 2005. TPC executed an agreement with this policyholder which resolved all past, present and future hazardous waste and pollution property damage claims, and all related past and pending bodily injury claims. In addition, TPC and this policyholder entered into a coverage in place agreement which addressed the handling and resolution of all future hazardous waste and pollution bodily injury claims. Under the coverage in place agreement, TPC has no defense obligation, and there is an overall cap with respect to any indemnity obligation that might be owed. The first two of three payments related to this settlement were made during 2005, and the final payment will be made in the first quarter of 2006. The following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Beginning reserves: Direct $ 725 $ 331 $ 448 Ceded (84 ) (41 ) (62 ) Net 641 290 386 Reserves acquired: Direct 271 Ceded (58 ) Net 213 Incurred losses and loss expenses: Direct 17 323 59 Ceded 13 (33 ) Net 30 290 59 Losses paid: Direct 248 200 176 Ceded (2 ) (48 ) (21 ) Net 246 152 155 Ending reserves: Direct 494 725 331 Ceded (69 ) (84 ) (41 ) Net $ 425 $ 641 $ 290 UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES As a result of the processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at December 31, 2005 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and managements judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Companys previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company and future developments pertaining to the Companys ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and 79 environmental claims. In addition, the Companys asbestos related claims and claim adjustment expense experience has been impacted by the exhaustion or unavailability due to insolvency of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders along with the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation, including legislation related to asbestos reform. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of large coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos reserves, which includes an annual ground up review of asbestos policyholders, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. The Company completed the annual ground up review during the fourth quarter of 2005. Also see Part I Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current asbestos and environmental reserves. In addition, the Companys estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Companys operating results and financial condition in future periods. INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO The Companys invested assets at December 31, 2005 totaled $68.29 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in mortgage loans and real estate and 5% in other investments. Excluding the impact on invested assets of securities lending, unrealized investment gains and losses, receivables for investment sales and payables on investment purchases, the pretax average yield was 4.7%, 4.8% and 5.3% and the after tax average yield was 3.7%, 3.7% and 4.0% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a conservative investment philosophy. The Companys fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2005 totaled $58.98 billion, comprising $58.71 billion of publicly traded fixed maturities and $274 million of private fixed maturities. The weighted average quality ratings of the Companys publicly traded fixed maturity portfolio and private fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2005 were AA1 and A3, respectively. Included in the fixed maturity portfolio at that date was approximately $1.75 billion of below investment grade securities. During 2005, holdings of tax exempt securities were increased to $31.46 billion to take advantage of their relatively high credit quality and attractive after tax yields. The average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short term investments, was 3.9 years as of December 31, 2005 (4.3 years excluding short term investments), compared with 4.1 years as of December 31, 2004 (4.4 years excluding short term investments). The following table sets forth the Companys combined fixed maturity investment portfolio classified by Moodys Investors Service ratings: (at December 31, 2005, in millions) Carrying Value Percent of Total Carrying Value Quality Rating: Aaa $ 38,477 65.2 % Aa 11,099 18.8 A 4,469 7.6 Baa 3,186 5.4 Total investment grade 57,231 97.0 Non investment grade 1,752 3.0 Total fixed maturity investments $ 58,983 100.0 % The Company makes investments in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) that typically have high credit quality, offer good liquidity, and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to U.S. Treasury securities. The Companys investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved. One significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity. While prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration) and its effect on total return cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company does invest in other types of CMO tranches if a careful assessment indicates a favorable risk/return tradeoff. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. 80 At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company held CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $3.43 billion and $3.30 billion, respectively (excluding Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities of $1.16 billion and $953 million, respectively). Approximately 43% and 53% of the Companys CMO holdings are guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, the Company held $4.83 billion and $4.66 billion of GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC or FHA mortgage backed pass through securities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Virtually all of these securities are rated Aaa. The Companys real estate investments include warehouses and office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned. The Companys other investments primarily comprise venture capital, through direct ownership and limited partnerships, private equity limited partnerships, joint ventures, other limited partnerships and trading securities, which are subject to more volatility than the Companys fixed income investments, but historically have provided a higher return. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of the Companys other investments was $3.03 billion and $3.43 billion, respectively. Impairment charges included in net realized investment gains (losses) were as follows: (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Fixed maturities $ 11 $ 25 $ 65 Equity securities 5 6 Venture capital 80 40 Real estate and other 18 10 19 Total $ 109 $ 80 $ 90 For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized the following other than temporary impairments: $11 million in the fixed income portfolio related to various issuers due to credit risk associated with the issuers deteriorated financial position. $80 million in the venture capital portfolio on 22 holdings. Two of the holdings were impaired due to new financings at less than favorable rates. Fifteen holdings experienced fundamental economic deterioration (characterized by less than expected revenues or a fundamental change in product). Three of the holdings were impaired due to the impending sale, liquidation or shutdown of the entity. Two of the holdings were public securities whose cost basis was not anticipated to be recovered over the expected holding period. The Company continually evaluates current developments in the market that have the potential to affect the valuation of the Companys investments. $18 million in its real estate and other holdings. The losses recorded were the result of an equity partnership and a private stock holding which both experienced fundamental deterioration in their financial position. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized the following other than temporary impairments: $25 million in the fixed income portfolio related to various issuers due to credit risk associated with the issuers deteriorated financial position. $5 million in the equity portfolio when it became apparent that the cost basis of those securities would not be recovered over the expected holding period. $40 million in its venture capital portfolio on 16 holdings. Three of the holdings were impaired due to new financings at less than favorable rates. Five holdings experienced fundamental economic deterioration (characterized by less than expected revenues or a fundamental change in product). Eight of the holdings were impaired due to the impending sale, liquidation or shutdown of the entity. The Company continually evaluates current developments in the market that have the potential to affect the valuation of the Companys investments. $10 million in its real estate and other holdings. The losses recorded were the result of falling rental rates and occupancies in three of the Companys real estate investment holdings. The Company recognized other than temporary impairments of $65 million in the fixed income portfolio during 2003 related to various issuers, with $8 million due to companies filing bankruptcy and the remainder related to credit risk due to the issuers deteriorated financial position. 81 For publicly traded securities, the amounts of the impairments were recognized by writing down the investments to quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, impairments are recognized by writing down the investment to its estimated fair value, as determined during the Companys quarterly internal review process. The specific circumstances that led to the impairments described above did not materially impact other individual investments held during 2005 or 2004. The following table summarizes for all fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale and for equity securities reported at fair value for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost at December 31, 2005, the gross unrealized investment loss by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position: Period For Which Fair Value Is Less Than 80% of Amortized Cost (in millions) Less Than 3 Months Greater Than 3 Months, Less Than 6 Months Greater Than 6 Months, Less Than 12 Months Greater Than 12 Months Total Fixed maturities $ 1 $ $ $ $ 1 Equity securities Venture capital Total $ 1 $ $ $ $ 1 Unrealized investment losses as of December 31, 2005 represent less than 1% of the portfolio, and, therefore, any impact on the Companys financial position would not be significant. At December 31, 2005, non investment grade securities comprised 3% of the Companys fixed income investment portfolio. Included in those categories at December 31, 2005 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $907 million and a fair value of $870 million, resulting in a net pretax unrealized investment loss of $37 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 2% of the total amortized cost and less than 2% of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2005, and accounted for 7% of the total pretax unrealized investment loss in the fixed income portfolio. Following are the pretax realized losses on investments sold during the year ended December 31, 2005: (in millions) Loss Fair Value Fixed maturities $ 118 $ 3,274 Equity securities 9 166 Other 18 242 Total $ 145 $ 3,682 Resulting purchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Companys ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations. OUTLOOK The Companys strategic objective is to enhance its position as a consistently profitable market leader and a cost effective provider of property and casualty insurance in the United States. A variety of factors continue to affect the property and casualty insurance market and the Companys core business outlook for 2006, including increasingly competitive conditions throughout the majority of markets served by the Companys business segments, loss cost trends (including medical inflation and auto loss costs), asbestos related developments and rising reinsurance and litigation costs. The Company expects property casualty market conditions to continue to be competitive throughout 2006. Relative to 2005, within the Commercial and Specialty segments, the Company expects renewal price changes to increase and terms, conditions and insured values to improve for exposures susceptible to catastrophe losses, such as coastal property and oil and gas related exposures, while renewal price changes for non catastrophe exposures are expected to be subject to modest declines. Also relative to 2005, within the Personal segment, the Company expects renewal price changes in the automobile market to remain relatively stable or decline modestly, while the homeowners market is expected to remain relatively stable. 82 The Company expects that the trend of increased severity and frequency of storms experienced in 2005 and 2004 will continue into 2006. Given the increased severity and frequency of storms, the Company is reassessing its definition of and exposure to coastal risks, as well as the impact, if any, on its reinsurance program. Accordingly, the Company is reviewing its pricing, exposures, return thresholds and terms and conditions it offers in coastal areas. In part as a result of the severity and frequency of storms in 2005 and 2004, the Company expects the cost of reinsurance to increase, and there may be reduced availability of reinsurance coverage. To the extent that the Company is not able to reflect the potentially increased costs of increased severity and frequency of storms or reinsurance in its pricing, the Companys results of operations will be adversely impacted. In particular, in the Personal segment, the Company expects a delay in its ability to increase pricing to offset these potentially increased costs since the Company cannot increase rates to the extent necessary without the approval of the regulatory authorities of certain states. Also, particularly in light of the frequency and severity of storms in the past two years, rating agencies may increase their capital requirements for the Company. With respect to non catastrophe claim frequency, the industry has experienced unprecedented low levels over the last several years, a trend that the Company does not expect to change materially in 2006. The Company expects severity trend, the other component of loss trend, to continue to remain stable for non catastrophe claims. Nevertheless, with continued pressure on pricing, it is possible that margins will contract in certain parts of the Companys business in 2006. Changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new investments. While a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new fixed income investments, it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and the availability of gains on disposition. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments and the availability of realized investment gains on disposition. In 2005, short term interest rates continued to increase, while long term interest rates remained consistent with 2004 levels. Consequently, yields available on new investments began to grow, but remained below the existing portfolios average book yield. The continuation of an upward trend in interest rates in 2006 would favorably impact the average book yield of the Companys fixed income holdings. As required by various state laws and regulations, the Companys insurance subsidiaries are subject to assessments from state administered guaranty associations, second injury funds and similar associations. In the opinion of the Companys management, these assessments will not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Some social, economic, political and litigation issues have led to an increased number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at addressing the cost and availability of some types of insurance as well as the claim and coverage obligations of insurers. While most of these provisions have failed to become law, these initiatives may continue as legislators and regulators consider responses to consumer concerns about availability, affordability and claims handling and coverage, and the resulting laws and regulations, if any, could adversely affect the Companys ability to write business with appropriate returns. On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the Terrorism Act) was enacted into Federal law and established the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (the Program), a temporary Federal program in the Department of the Treasury, that provided for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. The Program was scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2005. On December 22, 2005, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (the Terrorism Extension Act) was enacted into Federal law, reauthorizing the Program through December 31, 2007, while reducing the Federal role under the Program. In order for a loss to be covered under the Program (subject losses), the loss must meet certain aggregate industry loss minimums that vary by Program year of amounts $100 million or less, and must be the result of an event that is certified as an act of terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The original Program excluded from participation certain of the following types of insurance: Federal crop insurance, private mortgage insurance, financial guaranty insurance, medical malpractice insurance, health or life insurance, flood insurance, and reinsurance. The Terrorism Extension Act exempted from coverage certain additional types of insurance, including commercial automobile, professional liability (other than directors and officers), surety, burglary and theft, and farm owners multi peril. In the case of a war declared by Congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the Terrorism Act and the Terrorism Extension Act. Both Acts generally require that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the United States participate in the Program. Under the Program, a participating insurer is entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal Government for a percentage of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. The Federal reimbursement percentage remains at 90% for 2006, but decreases to 85% in 2007. In each case, the deductible is calculated by applying the deductible percentage to the insurers direct earned premiums for covered lines from the calendar year immediately preceding the applicable year. The deductible 83 under the Program was 7% for 2003, 10% for 2004 and 15% for 2005, and will be 17.5% for 2006 and 20% for 2007. The Companys estimated deductible under the Program is $1.91 billion for 2006. The annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100 billion. Once subject losses have reached the $100 billion aggregate during a program year, there is no additional reimbursement from the U.S. Treasury and an insurer that has met its deductible for the program year is not liable for any losses (or portion thereof) that exceed the $100 billion cap. The Company had no terrorism related losses in 2005, 2004 or 2003. While the Terrorism Acts provide a Federally funded backstop for commercial property casualty insurers, they also require that insurers offer coverage for insured losses caused by acts of terrorism. The majority of the Companys Commercial and Specialty policies already included such coverage, although exclusions were added to higher risk policyholders after September 11, 2001. For those risks considered higher risk, such as landmark buildings or high concentrations of employees in one location, the Company will continue to either decline to offer a renewal or will offer coverage for losses caused by acts of terrorism on a limited basis, with an explicit charge for the coverage. There are currently various state and federal legislative and judicial proposals to require asbestos claimants to demonstrate an asbestos illness. At this time it is not possible to predict the likelihood or timing of such proposals being enacted or the effect if they are enacted. The Companys ongoing analysis of its asbestos reserves did not assume the adoption of any asbestos reforms. For information about the outlook with respect to asbestos related claims and liabilities see Asbestos Claims and Litigation and Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a measure of a companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations. The liquidity requirements of the Companys business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, asset maturities and income received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. The timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable. Such claims, including those associated with Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, increase liquidity requirements. The timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the volatility of asbestos related claim payments, as well as potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of the Companys management that the Companys future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $3.59 billion, $5.07 billion and $3.83 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash flows in 2005 reflected an increase in loss and loss adjustment expense payments primarily related to the catastrophe losses incurred during 2005 and 2004, and an increase in tax payments resulting from higher profitability. Cash flows in 2004 included $867 million in cash proceeds received pursuant to the commutation of specific reinsurance agreements in the second quarter described previously. Cash flows in 2004 also benefited from premium rate and volume increases. The significant reserve adjustments recorded subsequent to the merger in 2004 did not materially impact 2004 cash flows. The Company utilized $2.00 billion and $548 million of net operating loss carryforwards (NOL) during 2005 and 2004, respectively, thereby reducing current regular tax payments by $698 million and $192 million, respectively. Net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2003 benefited from premium rate increases and the receipt of $361 million from Citigroup, Inc., a former affiliate, and $531 million of federal income taxes refunded from the Companys net operating loss carryback. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for all three years were negatively impacted by payments for asbestos and environmental liabilities. Cash flows from operating activities in 2005 and 2004 were also negatively impacted by payments related to the Companys runoff operations. Included in the Companys structured agreement component of asbestos loss reserves at December 31, 2005 was $404 million (net of reinsurance) for the Companys single payment contribution to the proposed settlement related to PPG, and $502 million for the Companys settlement of the Statutory and Hawaii Actions and the Common Law Claims. Although each of these settlements is subject to certain contingencies or final orders and relief as previously discussed, it is possible that these settlement amounts will be paid in 2006. Net cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $3.04 billion, $4.65 billion and $2.48 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Fixed maturity securities accounted for the majority of investment purchases in all three years. In 2003, cash used in investing activities was partly offset by sales of securities to fund net payment activity related to debt and junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts of $772 million. 84 The Companys cash flows in 2005 included $2.40 billion of pretax proceeds (after underwriting fees and transaction costs) from the divestiture of its equity interest in Nuveen Investments. Of this amount, $405 million was received directly by the Companys insurance subsidiaries, and the remainder was received directly by the holding company. Of the proceeds received directly by the holding company, $1.225 billion was contributed to the capital of the Companys insurance subsidiaries, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. Holding company liquidity levels were increased in 2005 through dividends received from the Companys operating subsidiaries, the retained proceeds from the Nuveen Investments divestiture, the third quarter 2005 proceeds of $442 million from the settlement of the forward purchase contracts for the Companys common stock related to equity units issued in 2002 (described in more detail below), and the fourth quarter issuance of $400 million of 5.50% senior notes. Net cash flows of discontinued operations were not significant in 2005 or 2004. The majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid intermediate term taxable U.S. government, corporate and mortgage backed bonds and tax exempt U.S. municipal bonds. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Companys insurance and debt obligations. The Companys management of the duration of the fixed income investment portfolio generally produces a duration that exceeds the duration of the Companys net insurance liabilities. As the Companys investment strategy focuses on asset and liability durations, and not specific cash flows, asset sales may be required to satisfy obligations and or rebalance asset portfolios. The average duration of fixed maturities and short term securities was 3.9 years at December 31, 2005, compared with 4.1 years at December 31, 2004. The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, venture capital and real estate. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity. The primary goals of the Companys asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities, manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities, and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Companys fixed income portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Companys insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed income portfolio exceeds the present value of the net insurance liabilities, plus the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds provides assurance of the Companys ability to fund the payment of claims without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities. At December 31, 2005, total cash, short term invested assets and other readily marketable securities aggregating $1.57 billion were held at the holding company level. These assets were primarily funded by dividends from subsidiaries, proceeds from the divestiture of Nuveen Investments, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and debt as described below. As also noted above, the holding company contributed $1.225 billion of the Nuveen Investment proceeds to the capital of its insurance subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2005. The assets held at the holding company, combined with other sources of funds available, primarily additional dividends from operating subsidiaries, are considered sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements of the Company. These liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends and debt service. Net cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations totaled $473 million, $516 million and $1.10 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, the Company repaid $815 million of its outstanding debt, primarily comprised of the following: maturities of $238 million of 7.875% senior notes, $79 million of 7.125% senior notes, and $99 million of medium term notes bearing interest rates ranging from 6.44% to 7.09%; and a net repayment of commercial paper borrowings of $395 million. In November 2005, the Company issued $400 million of 5.50% senior notes maturing in December 2015. The majority of proceeds was used to fund the repayment of commercial paper borrowings, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. 85 In July 2002, concurrent with the issuance of 17.8 million of SPC common shares in a public offering, SPC issued 8.9 million equity units, each having a stated amount of $50, for gross consideration of $442 million. Each equity unit initially consisted of a forward purchase contract for the Companys common stock, which matured in August 2005, and an unsecured $50 senior note of the Company (maturing in 2007). Total annual distributions on the equity units were at the rate of 9.00%, consisting of interest on the note at a rate of 5.25% and fee payments under the forward contract of 3.75%. Holders of the equity units had the opportunity to participate in a required remarketing of the senior note component. The initial remarketing date was May 11, 2005. On that date, the notes were successfully remarketed, and the interest rate on the notes was reset to 5.01%, from 5.25%, effective May 16, 2005. The remarketed notes mature on August 16, 2007. The forward purchase contract required the investor to purchase, for $50, a variable number of shares of the Companys common stock on the settlement date of August 16, 2005. The number of shares purchased was determined based on a formula that considered the average closing price of the Companys common stock on each of 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the settlement date, in relation to the $24.20 per share price of common stock at the time of the offering. On the August 16, 2005 settlement date, the Company issued 15.2 million common shares and received total proceeds of $442 million. Net maturities and retirements of debt, including the repurchase of Commercial Insurance Resources, Inc.s (CIRI) outstanding notes, totaled $75 million in 2004. In addition, the Company repurchased the minority interest in CIRI during 2004 for a total cost of $76 million. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2003 included the redemption of $900 million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts, the repayment of $700 million of notes payable to a former affiliate and the repayment of $550 million of short term debt. Funds used in these repayments were primarily provided by the Companys issuance of $1.40 billion of senior notes in March 2003 and by cash flows provided by operating activities. These refinancing activities were initiated with the objective of lowering the average interest rate on the Companys total outstanding debt. Also reflected in 2003 was the issuance of $550 million of short term Floating Rate Notes which were used to repay the $550 million Promissory Note due in January 2004. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $628 million, $642 million and $282 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys $636 million of common dividends in 2004 were comprised of regular quarterly dividends totaling $522 million and $114 million that had been declared by SPC prior to the merger. That amount consisted of SPCs regular quarterly dividend at a rate of $0.29 per share ($66 million), and a special $0.21 per share ($48 million) dividend related to the merger. The special dividend declared by SPC prior to the closing of the merger was designed to result in the holders of SPCs common stock prior to the merger receiving aggregate dividends with record dates in 2004 of $1.16 per share, which was SPCs indicated annual dividend rate prior to the merger. On February 7, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share, payable March 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2006. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Companys common stock will be at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of the Companys operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends would be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. In 2005 and 2004, the Company acquired 0.8 million and 0.4 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options. In 2003, TPC repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares (as adjusted for the merger) of common stock at a total cost of $40 million, representing the acquisition of shares under a repurchase program that had been approved by TPCs board of directors. TPCs repurchase program was terminated upon completion of the merger. Upon completion of the merger on April 1, 2004, the Company acquired all obligations related to SPCs outstanding debt, which had a carrying value of $3.68 billion at the time of the merger. In accordance with purchase accounting, the carrying value of the SPC debt acquired was adjusted to market value as of April 1, 2004 using the effective interest rate method, which resulted in a $301 million adjustment to increase the amount of the Companys consolidated debt outstanding. That fair value adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments acquired. That amortization, which totaled $54 million in 2005 and $55 million in 2004, reduced reported interest expense. 86 Debt and convertible notes payable outstanding were as follows: (at December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 Short term: Commercial paper $ 104 $ 499 Medium term notes maturing in following year 56 99 6.75% Senior notes due November 15, 2006 150 7.875% Senior notes due April 15, 2005 238 7.125% Senior notes due June 1, 2005 79 Total short term debt 310 915 Long term: Medium term notes with various maturities through 2010 242 298 6.75% Senior notes due November 15, 2006 150 5.75% Senior notes due March 15, 2007 500 500 5.01%* Senior notes due August 16, 2007 442 5.25%* Senior notes due August 16, 2007 442 3.75% Senior notes due March 15, 2008 400 400 Zero coupon convertible notes due 2009 122 117 8.125% Senior notes due April 15, 2010 250 250 7.81% Private placement notes due on various dates through 2011 16 20 5.00% Senior notes due March 15, 2013 500 500 5.50% Senior notes due December 1, 2015 400 7.75% Senior notes due April 15, 2026 200 200 7.625% Subordinated debentures due December 15, 2027 125 125 8.47% Subordinated debentures due January 10, 2027 81 81 4.50% Convertible junior subordinated notes payable due April 15, 2032 893 893 6.375% Senior notes due March 15, 2033 500 500 8.50% Subordinated debentures due December 15, 2045 56 56 8.312% Subordinated debentures due July 1, 2046 73 73 7.60% Subordinated debentures due October 15, 2050 593 593 Total long term debt 5,393 5,198 Total debt principal 5,703 6,113 Unamortized fair value adjustment 185 239 Unamortized debt issuance costs (38 ) (39 ) Total debt $ 5,850 $ 6,313 * These senior notes had an interest rate of 5.25% at December 31, 2004. The interest rate was reset to 5.01% in May 2005 pursuant to the remarketing of these notes as described below. The Company has the option to defer interest payments on its convertible junior subordinated notes for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly interest periods. If the Company elects to defer interest payments on the notes, it will not be permitted, with limited exceptions, to pay dividends on its common stock during a deferral period. In November 2005, the Company issued $400 million of 5.50% senior notes due December 1, 2015. The notes pay interest semi annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2006, are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Companys other senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of: 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed; or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the then current Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. The majority of the proceeds was used to pay down the Companys commercial paper outstanding, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. 87 On March 11, 2003, TPC issued $1.40 billion of senior notes comprising $400 million of 3.75% senior notes due March 15, 2008, $500 million of 5.00% senior notes due March 15, 2013 and $500 million of 6.375% senior notes due March 15, 2033. The notes pay interest semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2003, are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of TPCs other senior unsecured indebtedness. TPC may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity by paying a make whole premium based on U.S. Treasury rates. The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were contributed to its primary subsidiary, Travelers Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. (TIGHI), so that TIGHI could prepay and refinance $500 million of 3.60% indebtedness to Citigroup and redeem $900 million aggregate principal amount of TIGHIs 8.00% to 8.08% junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts. These trusts, in turn, used these funds to redeem $900 million of preferred capital securities on April 9, 2003. These senior notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes (the restricted notes) were not registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and could not be transferred or resold except pursuant to certain exemptions. As part of this offering, TPC agreed to file a registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the exchange of the notes for registered notes (the Exchange Notes) having terms identical to those of the senior notes described above (Exchange Offer). On April 14, 2003, TPC initiated the Exchange Offer pursuant to a Form S 4 that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, each series of Exchange Notes has been registered under the Securities Act, and the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the restricted notes do not apply to the Exchange Notes. Line of Credit Agreements. The Company maintains an $800 million commercial paper program with back up liquidity consisting of a bank credit agreement. In June 2005, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion, five year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. The new credit agreement replaced and consolidated the Companys three prior bank credit agreements that had collectively provided the Company access to $1.0 billion of bank credit lines. Pursuant to covenants in the new credit agreement, the Company must maintain an excess of consolidated net worth over goodwill and other intangible assets of not less than $10 billion at all times. The Company must also maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. In addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default, including with respect to a change in control. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and all other covenants related to its respective debt instruments outstanding. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, the Company has an option to increase the credit available under the facility, no more than once a year, up to a maximum facility amount of $1.5 billion, subject to the satisfaction of a ratings requirement and certain other conditions. There was no amount outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2005. Shelf Registration. In December 2005, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering. 88 Contractual Obligations The following table excludes short term obligations. The table also excludes estimated cash flows of claim and claim related payments, which are presented in the table that follows. The contractual obligations, which include only liabilities at December 31, 2005 with a cash payment requirement for settlement, were as follows: Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Debt(1) Medium term notes $ 298 $ 56 $ 221 $ 21 $ Convertible notes 893 893 Senior notes 3,342 150 1,342 250 1,600 Capital trusts 928 928 Zero coupon convertible notes 141 141 Private placement notes 16 4 6 4 2 Total debt 5,618 210 1,569 416 3,423 Operating leases(2) 757 173 281 139 164 Purchase obligations Information systems administration and maintenance commitments(3) 109 49 39 21 Reinsurance brokerage commitment(4) 140 20 40 40 40 Other purchase commitments(5) 87 40 7 4 36 Total purchase obligations 336 109 86 65 76 Long term liabilities Unfunded investment commitments(6) 931 186 390 226 129 Total long term liabilities 931 186 390 226 129 Total Contractual Obligations $ 7,642 $ 678 $ 2,326 $ 846 $ 3,792 (1) See note 10 of the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. (2) Represents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space, equipment and furniture. (3) Includes agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services. (4) In connection with the sale of its insurance brokerage operations, the Company committed to acquire brokerage services from the buyer through 2012. See note 17. (5) Includes commitments to vendors entered into in the ordinary course of business for goods and services including office supplies, archival services, etc. (6) Represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for investments in real estate partnerships, private equities and hedge funds. The Company is not required to make any contributions to its qualified pension plan in 2006 and does not have a best estimate of contributions expected to be paid to the qualified pension plan. Accordingly, any future contributions are not included in the foregoing contractual obligation table. 89 Estimated Claims and Claim Related Payments The table below presents the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Companys assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below, required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty. The following table includes estimated future claims and claims related payments, net of the estimated reinsurance recoveries, where applicable, at December 31, 2005. Estimated Payments by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Estimated future payments resulting from: (1) Claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 43,782 $ 12,203 $ 13,693 $ 6,375 $ 11,511 (2) Claims from large deductible polices (3) Loss based assessments 224 30 51 24 119 (4) Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits 421 135 241 45 (5) Payout from ceded funds withheld 449 22 168 90 219 Total $ 44,926 $ 12,390 $ 14,153 $ 6,534 $ 11,849 (1) The amounts in Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables. Therefore, estimated future payments include cash inflows related to reinsurance arrangements that qualify for reinsurance accounting. A reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk, in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting. Since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are highly correlated to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, the analysis above presents the estimated cash outflows for reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expense, net of reinsurance. Reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits in the table above. For business underwritten by non U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on December 31, 2005. The amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Companys balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses has been discounted in the balance sheet. (See note 1 of the financial statements.) (2) Workers compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. Claims from large deductible policies represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholders escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table. 90 The estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers compensation policies is presented below: (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Contractholder payables/ receivables $ 5,516 $ 1,362 $ 1,492 $ 755 $ 1,907 (3) The amounts in Loss based assessments relate to estimated future payments of second injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities. Second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre existing condition. For loss based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second injury fund assessments are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. (4) The amounts in Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits. Amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Companys balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been discounted using deposit accounting. (5) The amounts in Payouts from ceded funds withheld represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the Company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held. The above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur future payment obligations under such agreements. See note 9 of the Companys consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. Dividend Availability The Companys principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of Connecticut and Minnesota. The insurance holding company laws of both states applicable to the Companys subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, that together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurers net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Companys subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $2.56 billion is available by the end of 2006 for such dividends without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department for Connecticut domiciled subsidiaries and the Minnesota Department of Commerce for Minnesota domiciled subsidiaries. The Company received $968 million of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2005. Risk Based Capital The NAIC adopted RBC requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action. The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital higher than RBC requirements. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. At December 31, 2005, all of the Companys insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to agency loans and letters of credit, issuance of debt securities, third party loans related to venture capital investments and various indemnifications related to the sale of business entities to third parties. See note 17 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these arrangements to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 91 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, and investment impairments. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves (loss reserves) represent managements estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Companys assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing reserves, the Company also takes into account estimated recoveries, reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. The reserves are reviewed regularly by a qualified actuary employed by the Company. The process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for loss and loss adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process. The Company continually refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including but not limited to the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability will be different from that anticipated at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than currently reserved favorable or unfavorable. Because establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. There are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophes occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge. A portion of the Companys loss reserves are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation which aggregated $4.79 billion at December 31, 2005. While the ongoing study of asbestos claims and associated liabilities and of environmental claims considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Companys management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the Companys future operating results and financial condition. See the preceding discussion of Asbestos Claims and Litigation and Environmental Claims and Litigation. 92 The Company acquired SPCs runoff health care reserves in the merger, which are included in the General Liability product line in the table below. SPC decided to exit this market at the end of 2001 and ceased underwriting new business as quickly as regulatory considerations allowed. SPC had experienced significant adverse loss development on its health care loss reserves both prior to and since its decision to exit this market. The Company continues to utilize specific tools and metrics to explicitly monitor and validate its key assumptions supporting its conclusions with regard to these reserves since management believed that its traditional statistics and reserving methods needed to be supplemented in order to provide a more meaningful analysis. The tools developed track three primary indicators which influence those conclusions and include: newly reported claims; reserve development on known claims; and the redundancy ratio, which compares the cost of resolving claims to the reserve established for that individual claim. These three indicators are related such that if one deteriorates, improvement on another is necessary for the Company to conclude that further reserve strengthening is not necessary. The Companys current view is that it has recorded a reasonable reserve for its medical malpractice exposures as of December 31, 2005. Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows: 2005 2004 (at December 31, in millions) Case IBNR Total Case IBNR Total General liability $ 8,198 $ 12,251 $ 20,449 $ 8,445 $ 12,232 $ 20,677 Property 1,987 1,050 3,037 1,534 1,359 2,893 Commercial multi peril 2,448 2,901 5,349 1,979 2,216 4,195 Commercial automobile 2,792 1,885 4,677 2,817 1,966 4,783 Workers compensation 8,816 6,374 15,190 8,313 6,658 14,971 Fidelity and surety 1,240 673 1,913 1,216 845 2,061 Personal automobile 1,470 1,138 2,608 1,484 1,219 2,703 Homeowners and personal other 709 987 1,696 470 523 993 International and other 3,033 3,055 6,088 2,934 2,774 5,708 Property casualty 30,693 30,314 61,007 29,192 29,792 58,984 Accident and health 74 9 83 76 10 86 Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves $ 30,767 $ 30,323 $ 61,090 $ 29,268 $ 29,802 $ 59,070 The $2.02 billion increase in property casualty claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2004 reflected the impact of the significant catastrophe losses incurred in the second half of 2005 and the $830 million net charge to increase asbestos reserves in the fourth quarter of 2005. These increases in reserves were partially offset by claim and claim expense payments from runoff operations, loss payouts for the third quarter 2004 hurricanes, and favorable non catastrophe loss experience. Property casualty claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at December 31, 2004 increased by $24.51 billion over year end 2003, primarily as a result of the merger with SPC and reserve charges recorded subsequent to the merger. Of the increase in 2004, $19.50 billion resulted from the addition of the acquired reserves, and $2.39 billion, net of reinsurance, was due to net unfavorable prior year reserve development. For discussion of the components of net unfavorable prior year reserve development, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi peril lines and International and other lines in the summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately, see Asbestos Claims and Litigation, Environmental Claims and Litigation and Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves. 93 General Discussion The process for estimating the liabilities for claim and claim expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. Multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. In most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given subsequent information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of managements recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate. The exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. Property casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims made or on an occurrence basis. Policies written on a claims made basis require that claims be reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. Most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The use of the occurrence form accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, and it is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation and judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics, among others. A key assumption in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. Informed management judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application, on a consistent basis over time, of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, individuals involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel as well as other company management. Therefore, it is quite possible and, generally, likely that management must consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of loss reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult. 94 The variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. Product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. A major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag the greater the proportion of IBNR claims to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. For some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being low frequency/high severity, while lines without this large claim sensitivity are referred to as high frequency/low severity. Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to a few key assumptions. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, high frequency/low severity lines tend to have much greater spread of estimation risk, such that the impact of individual claims are relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable. Claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. Actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different experts will choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimate selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other. Lastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. The merger of TPC and SPC resulted in the exposure of each others actuaries and claim departments to different products, data histories, analysis methodologies, claim settlement experts, and more robust data when viewed on a combined basis. This impacted the range of estimates produced by the Companys actuaries, as they reacted to new data, approaches, and sources of expertise to draw upon. It also resulted in additional levels of uncertainty, as past trends (that were a function of past products, past claim handling procedures, past claim departments, and past legal and other experts) may not repeat themselves, as those items affecting the trends change or evolve due to the merger. This also increased the potential for material variation in estimates, as experts can have differing views as to the impact of these frequently evolutionary changes. Events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends reestablish themselves within the new organization. Risk factors The major causes of material uncertainty (risk factors) generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. In some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently. 95 Some risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components. The effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors. The evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region. While some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in step wise fashion. The final impact is not known until all steps have occurred. Sudden changes generally cause a one time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. Managements estimates At least once per quarter, Company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claim and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability. Such an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform. This is due to the need to evaluate the underlying cause of the trends observed, and may include the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Companys estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is a function of these detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information. Discussion of Product Lines The following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. General Liability General liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self insured retentions. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within 5 to 7 years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade for construction defect claims). 96 While the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are typically insured on a claims made basis. General liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholders legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimants private property arising from the policyholders legal obligation for non intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. In addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately, such as asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect, medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on traditional actuarial methods. Defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim. Such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims made products. When defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid do not erode the policy limits. This line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag, i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and or latent claim exposure. The amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the General Liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved, and greatest claim settlement complexity are Asbestos and Environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than Asbestos and Environmental, include construction defect, medical malpractice, and other mass tort actions. Many components of General Liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: 97 General liability risk factors Changes in claim handling philosophies Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision New theories of liability Trends in jury awards Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues Changes in statutes of limitations Changes in the underlying court system Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues Changes in tort law Shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) Changes in settlement patterns (e.g., medical malpractice) General liability book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Property Property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims. Property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Property risk factors Physical concentration of policyholders Availability and cost of local contractors For the more severe catastrophic events, demand surge inflation, whereby the greatly increased demand for building materials such as plywood far surpasses the immediate supply, leading to short term material increases in building material costs Local building codes Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims) Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition) Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake) Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations Property book of business risk factors Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards Commercial Multi Peril Commercial multi peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims. 98 The reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi peril is generally sold to smaller sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and property include larger customers. See the discussions under the property and general liability product lines with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi peril. Commercial Automobile The commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. Commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components; bodily injury liability, property damage liability, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors Trends in jury awards Changes in the underlying court system Changes in case law Litigation trends Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents Subrogation opportunities Changes in claim handling philosophies Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Types of medical treatments received Changes in cost of medical treatments Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Commercial automobile book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non fleets) Changes in underwriting standards Workers Compensation Workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured workers life, such as permanent disability benefits and on going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a workers injury. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk. Workers compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. 99 Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required workers compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Indemnity risk factors Time required to recover from the injury Degree of available transitional jobs Degree of legal involvement Changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers compensation commissions oversight of claims(1) Future wage inflation for states that index benefits Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds Medical risk factors Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (inflation) Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Type of medical treatments received Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices Availability of new medical processes and equipment Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment (1) These are administrative bodies that evaluate whether or not a given claim for workers compensation benefits is valid. Duties include the determination of whether a given injury arose out of the scope of employment, or the determination of the degree of injury where disputes exist. General workers compensation risk factors Frequency of claim reopenings on claims previously closed Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment Degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and health insurance Workers compensation book of business risk factors Product mix Injury type mix Changes in underwriting standards Fidelity and Surety Fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insureds business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas, the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity policies. Surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a somewhat longer settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (Large construction projects can take many years to complete.) The frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability to perform financially. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insureds assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured. 100 Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Fidelity risk factors Type of business of insured Policy limit and attachment points Third party claims Coverage litigation Complexity of claims Growth in insureds operations Surety risk factors Economic trends, including the general level of construction activity Concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims Type of business insured Type of obligation insured Cumulative limits of liability for insured Assets available to mitigate loss Defective workmanship/latent defects Financial strategy of insured Changes in statutory obligations Geographic spread of business Fidelity and Surety book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards Personal Automobile Personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. Personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: Bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors Trends in jury awards Changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy Changes in case law Litigation trends Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents Subrogation opportunities Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Changes in claim handling philosophies 101 No fault risk factors (for selected states and time periods) Effectiveness of no fault laws Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Types of medical treatments received Changes in cost of medical treatments Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Personal automobile book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Changes in underwriting standards Homeowners and Personal Lines Other Homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The claim is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made (or alternatively, the property replacement/repair is performed by the insurer). The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. The liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. In addition, reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future. Overall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. Homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include: Non catastrophe risk factors Salvage opportunities Amount of time to return property to residential use Changes in weather patterns Local building codes Litigation trends Trends in jury awards Catastrophe risk factors Physical concentration of policyholders Availability and cost of local contractors Local building codes Quality of construction of damaged homes Amount of time to return property to residential use For the more severe catastrophic events, demand surge inflation, whereby the greatly increased demand for building materials such as plywood far surpasses the immediate supply, leading to short term material increases in building material costs Homeowners book of business risk factors Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Degree of concentration of policyholders Changes in underwriting standards 102 International and other International and other includes the international product line and other products not discussed above. The principle component of other is assumed reinsurance written on an excess of loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non U.S. exposures, and is primarily runoff business. International and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework. Due to changes in the business mix for this line over time, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct), and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co insurers through a broker or lead insurer for claim settlement purposes. International and other reserves are generally analyzed by program/pool, country and general coverage category (e.g., U.S. Liability excess of loss reinsurance, or General Liability Municipalities by country.) The business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage/jurisdiction. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the General Liability and Automobile discussion above, but under a different legal system. Where the underlying hazard is within the U.S., the coverage involved is typically that of General Liability, but on an excess or excess of loss reinsurance basis. Excess exposure requires the insured to prove not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policys attachment point. Examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: International and other risk factors Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision New theories of liability Trends in jury awards Changes in the propensity to sue Changes in statutes of limitations Changes in the underlying court system Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues Changes in tort law Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) International and other book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, claims made language) Changes in underwriting standards Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Reinsurance Recoverables The following table summarizes the composition of the Companys reinsurance recoverable assets: (at December 31, in millions) 2005 2004 Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 14,177 $ 13,367 Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (804 ) (751 ) Net reinsurance recoverables 13,373 12,616 Mandatory pools and associations 2,211 2,497 Structured settlements 3,990 3,941 Total reinsurance recoverables $ 19,574 $ 19,054 103 The $810 million increase in gross reinsurance recoverables over year end 2004 was primarily due to recoverables resulting from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Companys rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Companys ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses, and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. Changes in these estimates could result in additional income statement charges. The increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance in 2005 was $53 million. Investment Impairments Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities An investment in a fixed maturity or equity security which is available for sale or reported at fair value is impaired if its fair value falls below its book value and the decline is considered to be other than temporary. Fixed maturities for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost for more than one quarter are evaluated for other than temporary impairment. A fixed maturity is impaired if it is probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due under the securitys contractual terms. Factors the Company considers in determining whether a decline is other than temporary for debt securities include the following: the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost. It is likely that the Company will conclude that the decline is other than temporary if the market value has been below cost for six to nine months; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. The issuer may be experiencing depressed and declining earnings relative to competitors, erosion of market share, deteriorating financial position, lowered dividend payments, declines in securities ratings, bankruptcy, and financial statement reports that indicate an uncertain future. Also, the issuer may experience specific events that may influence its operations or earnings potential, such as changes in technology, discontinuation of a business segment, catastrophic losses or exhaustion of natural resources; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. 104 Equity investments are impaired when it becomes probable that the Company will not recover its cost over the expected holding period. Public equity investments (i.e., common stocks) trading at a price that is less than 80% of cost for more than one quarter are reviewed for impairment. Investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment any time the investment has sustained losses and or negative operating cash flow for a period of nine months or more. Events triggering the other than temporary impairment analysis of public and non public equities may include the following, in addition to the considerations noted above for debt securities: Factors affecting performance: the investee loses a principal customer or supplier for which there is no short term prospect for replacement or experiences other substantial changes in market conditions; the company is performing substantially and consistently behind plan; the investee has announced, or the Company has become aware of, adverse changes or events such as changes or planned changes in senior management, restructurings, or a sale of assets; and the regulatory, economic, or technological environment has changed in a way that is expected to adversely affect the investees profitability. Factors affecting on going financial condition: factors that raise doubts about the investees ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies, investment advisors recommendations, or non compliance with regulatory capital requirements or debt covenants; a secondary equity offering at a price substantially lower than the holders cost; a breach of a covenant or the failure to service debt; and fraud within the company. For fixed maturity and equity investments, factors that may indicate that a decline in value is not other than temporary include the following: the securities owned continue to generate reasonable earnings and dividends, despite a general stock market decline; bond interest or preferred stock dividend rate (on cost) is lower than rates for similar securities issued currently but quality of investment is not adversely affected; the investment is performing as expected and is current on all expected payments; specific, recognizable, short term factors have affected the market value; and financial condition, market share, backlog and other key statistics indicate growth. Real Estate Investments The carrying values of real estate properties are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The review for impairment includes an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property. An impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property. 105 Venture Capital Investments Other investments include venture capital investments, which are generally non publicly traded instruments, consisting of early stage companies and, historically, having a holding period of four to seven years. These investments have primarily been made in the health care, software and computer services, and networking and information technologies infrastructures industries. The Company typically is involved with venture capital companies early in their formation, as they are developing and determining the viability of, and market demand for, their product. Generally the Company does not expect these venture capital companies to record revenues in the early stages of their development, which can often take three to four years, and does not generally expect them to become profitable for an even longer period of time. With respect to the Companys valuation of such non publicly traded venture capital investments, on a quarterly basis, portfolio managers as well as an internal valuation committee review and consider a variety of factors in determining the potential for loss impairment. Factors considered include the following: the issuers most recent financing event; an analysis of whether fundamental deterioration has occurred; whether or not the issuers progress has been substantially less than expected; whether or not the valuations have declined significantly in the entitys market sector; whether or not the internal valuation committee believes it is probable that the issuer will need financing within six months at a lower price than our carrying value; and whether or not we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery, enabling us to receive value equal to or greater than our cost. The quarterly valuation procedures described above are in addition to the portfolio managers ongoing responsibility to frequently monitor developments affecting those invested assets, paying particular attention to events that might give rise to impairment write downs. The Company manages the portfolio to maximize long term return, evaluating current market conditions and the future outlook for the entities in which it has invested. Because this portfolio primarily consists of privately held, early stage venture investments, events giving rise to impairment can occur in a brief period of time (e.g., the entity has been unsuccessful in securing additional financing, other investors decide to withdraw their support, complications arise in the product development process, etc.), and decisions are made at that point in time, based on the specific facts and circumstances, with respect to a recognition of other than temporary impairment or sale of the investment. Non Publicly Traded Investments The Companys investment portfolio includes non publicly traded investments, such as venture capital investments, private equity limited partnerships, joint ventures, other limited partnerships, and certain fixed income securities. Certain venture capital investments that are controlled by the Company are consolidated in the Companys financial statements. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures, limited partnerships and certain private equity securities. Certain other private equity investments, including venture capital investments, are not subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, but are reported at estimated fair value in accordance with FAS 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. The fair value of the venture capital investments is based on an estimate determined by an internal valuation committee for securities for which there is no public market. The internal valuation committee reviews such factors as recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth, and other business and market sector fundamental statistics in estimating fair values of specific investments. Other non publicly traded securities are valued based on factors such as management judgment, recent financial information and other market data. An impairment loss is recognized if, based on the specific facts and circumstances, it is probable that the Company will not be able to recover all of the cost of an individual holding. 106 The following is a summary of the approximate carrying value of the Companys non publicly traded securities at December 31, 2005: (in millions) Carrying Value Investment partnerships, including hedge funds $ 1,802 Fixed income securities 274 Equity investments 96 Real estate partnerships and joint ventures 133 Venture capital 449 Total $ 2,754 OTHER UNCERTAINTIES For a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the Companys results of operations or financial condition, see note 17 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements and Item 1A Risk Factors. FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See note 1 of notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This report may contain, and management may make, certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward looking statements. Specifically, the Company may make forward looking statements about the Companys results of operations (including, among others, premium volume, income from continuing operations, net and operating income and return on equity), financial condition and liquidity; the sufficiency of the Companys asbestos and other reserves (including, among others, asbestos claim payment patterns); the post merger integration (including, among others, expense savings); the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage; and strategic initiatives. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Companys control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward looking information and statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see Item 1A Risk Factors. The Companys forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update its forward looking statements. 107 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and other relevant market rate or price changes. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The following is a discussion of the Companys primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of December 31, 2005. The Companys market risk sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading. The carrying value of the Companys investment portfolio as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $68.29 billion and $64.37 billion, respectively, of which 86% and 84% was invested in fixed maturity securities, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 6% and 7%, respectively, of the Companys invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys exposure to equity price risk is not significant. The Company has no direct commodity risk. The primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. The portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions. The primary market risk for all of the Companys debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing. The Company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. For additional information regarding the Companys debt see note 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements as well as the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis. The Companys foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the Companys invested assets and insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies. Cash flows from the Companys foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Invested assets denominated in the British Pound Sterling comprised approximately 2.4% and 3.5% of the total invested assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. No other individual foreign currency accounted for more than 1.8% of the Companys invested assets at December 31, 2005 or 2004. There were no other significant changes in the Companys primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time. In the Companys sensitivity analysis model, a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates. Near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the Company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value. Interest Rate Risk In this sensitivity analysis model, the Company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. The sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short term securities, debt and derivative financial instruments. The primary market risk to the Companys market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk. The sensitivity analysis model uses a 100 basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model. 108 For invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates. Durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. Durations on tax exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the U.S. Treasury curve. Fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including accrued interest, using holdings as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. For debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical December 31, 2005 and 2004 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change, comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding. The sensitivity analysis model used by the Company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion based on a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the Company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends. In addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. As a result, the loss value excludes a significant portion of the Companys consolidated balance sheet, which if included in the sensitivity analysis model, would mitigate the impact of the loss in fair value associated with a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. A hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. The potential loss is reduced by foreign currency forward transactions that are used to hedge a portion of the Companys exposure to foreign currencies. The Companys analysis indicates that a hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $374 million and $438 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 109
