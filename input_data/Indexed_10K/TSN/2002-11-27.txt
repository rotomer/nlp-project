ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings for fiscal 2002 were $383 million or $1.08 per diluted share compared to $88 million or $0.40 per diluted share in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 earnings were positively affected by the addition of IBP, inc.s (IBP) beef, pork and prepared foods operations, improved performance of the chicken segment, a continued growth in value added businesses, and reduced operating costs. Additionally, the Company recognized a gain from the sale of its Specialty Brands subsidiary and received a partial settlement related to ongoing antitrust vitamin litigation. Earnings were adversely affected by charges related to the discontinuation of the Thomas E. Wilson brand, from the restructuring of the Companys live swine operation, an increase in interest expense and decreases in the international markets which were influenced by import restrictions and political pressures. On August 3, 2001, the Company acquired 50.1% ownership of IBP and acquired the remaining 49.9% on September 28, 2001. Accordingly, fiscal 2002 earnings include 52 weeks of IBPs results of operations, while fiscal 2001 fourth quarter and 12 months results include 50.1% of IBPs results for the nine weeks ended September 29, 2001. This information should be considered when comparing to previous years results of operations. The Companys accounting cycle resulted in a 52 week year for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000. In accordance with the provisions issued in Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill and indefinite lived assets are no longer amortized. The effect on current year results was an increase of approximately 20 cents per diluted share. In accordance with the guidance provided in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," and EITF Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products," beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company classifies the costs associated with sales incentives provided to retailers and payments such as slotting fees and cooperative advertising to vendors as a reduction in sales. These costs were previously included in selling, general and administrative expense. These reclassifications resulted in a reduction to sales and selling, general and administrative expense of approximately $188 million and $142 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2000, respectively, and had no impact on reported income before income taxes and minority interest, net income, or earnings per share amounts. 2002 vs. 2001 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. Sales increased 121.2%, with a 98.9% increase in volume and an 11.2% increase in price. The increase in sales volume and price is primarily due to the inclusion of IBPs sales in fiscal 2002. Despite lower commodity prices, sales prices increased due to product mix changes as the Company continues to grow its value added businesses. Cost of sales increased 123.1%, primarily due to the inclusion of IBPs cost of sales in fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 92.2% for 2002 compared to 91.5% for 2001. Operating expenses increased 58.4%, primarily due to the inclusion of IBPs operations in fiscal 2002. Also included in operating expenses are $53 million in charges related to the discontinuation of the Thomas E. Wilson brand and the restructuring of the Companys live swine operation. As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 4.0% for 2002 compared to 5.6% in 2001. In its effort to integrate, restructure and reorganize, the Company improved efficiencies and lowered plant operating costs. These costs were also reduced through other cost containment efforts and improved sales expense management. Interest expense increased 111.8% compared to 2001. As a percent of sales, interest expense was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for 2001. The Companys average indebtedness increased by 109.7% over the same period last year due to debt incurred to purchase IBP. The Companys short term interest rates decreased to 3.3% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 5.1% in fiscal 2001. The net average effective interest rate on total debt was 7.0% for 2002 compared to 6.9% for 2001. 23 Other income increased in the current year due to a gain of $22 million from the sale of the Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary. The effective tax rate was 35.5% in 2002 compared to 35.4% in 2001. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), at the beginning of 2002. Under FAS 142 the Company no longer amortized goodwill which resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate for 2002, offset primarily by a reduction in the foreign sales benefit. Segment Information Tyson Foods operates in five business segments: Beef, Chicken, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other. The Company measures segment profit as operating income. For the periods ending September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, the following information includes 100% of IBP results for 52 weeks and nine weeks, respectively. Information on segments is as follows. Beef segment is primarily involved in the slaughter of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into primal and sub primal meat cuts and case ready products. It also involves deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to further processors and others. The Beef segment markets its products to food retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants and hotel chains and other food processors in domestic and international markets. Allied products are also marketed to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products. Chicken segment includes fresh, frozen and value added chicken products sold through domestic food service, domestic retail markets for at home consumption, wholesale club markets targeted to small foodservice operations, small businesses and individuals, as well as specialty and commodity distributors who deliver to restaurants, schools and international markets throughout the world. The Chicken segment also includes sales from allied products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary. Pork segment represents the Companys live swine group, hog slaughter and fabrication operations, case ready products and related allied product processing activities. The Pork segment markets its products to food retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants and hotel chains and other food processors in domestic and international markets. It also sells allied products to pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as live swine to pork processors and producers. Prepared Foods segment includes the Companys operations that manufacture and market frozen and refrigerated food products. Products include pepperoni, beef and pork toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, hors doeuvres, desserts, prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes, specialty pasta and meat dishes as well as branded and processed meats. Other segment includes the logistics group and other corporate groups not identified with specific protein groups. Sales by Segment in millions 2002 2001 Change Beef $ 10,488 $ 2,027 $ 8,461 Chicken 7,222 7,057 165 Pork 2,503 619 1,884 Prepared Foods 3,072 818 2,254 Other 82 42 40 Total $ 23,367 $ 10,563 $ 12,804 24 Operating Income (Loss) by Segment in millions 2002 2001 Change Beef $ 220 $ 32 $ 188 Chicken 428 250 178 Pork 25 27 (2) Prepared Foods 158 15 143 Other 56 (8) 64 Total $ 887 $ 316 $ 571 Beef segment sales were $10.5 billion, including beef case ready sales of $689 million and international beef sales of $1.4 billion. Beef segment operating income totaled $220 million. The beef segment resulted from the acquisition of IBP in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Chicken segment sales increased $165 million or 2.3% from the same period last year, with a 1.1% increase in average sale prices and a 1.2% increase in volume. Foodservice chicken sales increased 4.9%, retail chicken sales increased 2.0% and international chicken sales decreased 6.3%. In fiscal 2002, the Companys Mexican subsidiary sales increased 36.1% from the same period last year due to the acquisition of a production facility in Mexico in the third quarter of 2001. This increase was more than offset by decreases in other international sales demand as markets continue to be impacted by import restrictions and political pressures primarily in Russia and China. Operating income for Chicken increased $178 million from the same period last year primarily due to decreases in live and production costs along with improvements in price and growth in value added product mix. Additionally, prior year costs were negatively impacted by weather rel ated effects and higher grain and energy costs. Pork segment sales including IBPs pork processing revenues were $2.5 billion compared to $619 million for the same period last year, including current year pork case ready sales of $212 million and international pork sales of $248 million. Pork segment operating income decreased $2 million from the same period last year. Sales and operating income were positively affected by the inclusion of the IBP pork processing results in fiscal 2002. However both were impacted by the negative results of the live swine operation. Operating income was also affected by the restructuring charge related to the Companys live swine operation of approximately $26 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Prepared Foods segment sales increased $2.3 billion from the same period last year. The prepared foods segment operating income increased $143 million from the same period last year. The increase in both sales and operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of IBP results. Operating income was also influenced by lower and more stable raw material prices and improvement in product mix. These increases were partially offset by the Thomas E. Wilson write down adjustment of $27 million related to the discontinuation of the brand. Other segment operating income increased $64 million primarily due to the partial settlement of approximately $30 million received in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 related to ongoing vitamin antitrust litigation combined with prior year IBP merger related expenses of $19 million. ACQUISITIONS In August 2001, the Company acquired 50.1% of IBP by paying approximately $1.7 billion in cash. In September 2001, the Company issued approximately 129 million shares of Class A stock, with a fair value of approximately $1.2 billion, to acquire the remaining IBP shares, and assumed approximately $1.7 billion of IBP debt. The total acquisition cost of approximately $4.6 billion was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accordingly, the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair values with the remainder of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price has been completed. In May 2002, the Company acquired the assets of Millard Processing Services, a bacon processing operation, for approximately $73 million in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and goodwill of approximately $14 million has been recorded. 25 DISPOSITION In September 2002, the Company completed the sale of its Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary. The subsidiary had been acquired with the IBP acquisition and its results of operations were included in the Companys prepared foods segment. The Company received cash proceeds of approximately $131 million which were used to reduce indebtedness and recognized a pretax gain of $22 million. Specialty Brand, Inc.s sales and operating income for the year ended September 28, 2002, were $244 million and $2 million respectively. 2001 vs. 2000 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. Sales increased 45.3%, with a 29.8% increase in volume and a 12.0% increase in price. The increase in sales is primarily due to the inclusion of nine weeks of IBPs sales in 2001. Comparable sales increased 3.4% on a volume increase of 1.1%. Breast meat commodity market prices were pressured by an oversupply of chicken for much of the fiscal year causing an adverse effect on the average sales prices and margins of many of the Companys core value added products. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company experienced improved pricing of value added products and seasonal price increases. Cost of sales increased 49.7%, primarily due to the added cost of sales for nine weeks of IBPs operations. As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 91.5% for 2001 compared to 88.8% for 2000. Excluding IBP, comparable cost of sales as a percent of sales was 90.0%. The increase in comparable cost of sales, as a percent of sales, was primarily due to weather related effects combined with higher grain and energy costs, lower market prices and product mix changes. Operating expenses increased 26.0%, primarily due to the inclusion of nine weeks of IBPs operations in 2001. As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 5.6% for 2001 compared to 6.4% in 2000. Excluding IBP, comparable operating expenses as a percent of sales were 8.1% for 2001. The increase is primarily due to an increase in sales promotional expenses and litigation costs related to the acquisition of IBP and ongoing employee practice matters. Included in the 2000 operating expenses was $24 million in bad debt reserve resulting from the bankruptcy filing by AmeriServe Food Distribution, Inc. (AmeriServe). Interest expense increased 24.1% compared to 2000. As a percent of sales, interest expense was 1.4% compared to 1.6% for 2000. The Companys average indebtedness increased by 24.3% over the 2000 amount as a result of the IBP acquisition. The Companys short term interest rates were slightly lower than the same period last year, and the net average effective interest rate on total debt was 6.9% for 2001 and 2000. The effective tax rate was 35.4% in 2001 compared to 35.6% in 2000. Segment Information The following information includes nine weeks results for the period ending September 29, 2001, related to the IBP acquisition, stated prior to adjustments for minority interest. Sales by Segment in millions 2001 2000 Change Beef $ 2,027 $ $ 2,027 Chicken 7,057 6,767 290 Pork 619 157 462 Prepared Foods 818 292 526 Other 42 52 (10) Total $ 10,563 $ 7,268 $ 3,295 26 Operating Income (Loss) by Segment in millions 2001 2000 Change Beef $ 32 $ $ 32 Chicken 250 316 (66) Pork 27 23 4 Prepared Foods 15 7 8 Other (8) 3 (11) Total $ 316 $ 349 $ (33) Beef segment sales, which include only the nine weeks of IBP results, were $2 billion, including case ready sales of $116 million. Beef segment operating income totaled $32 million. Beef sales and operating income are derived solely from the operations acquired from IBP, and as such have no comparative data since the Company did not have a beef group prior to the IBP acquisition. Chicken segment sales increased $290 million or 4.3% compared to 2000, with a 3.2% increase in average sales prices and a 1.0% increase in volume. Foodservice channel sales increased 1.0%, retail channel sales increased 1.2% and international channel sales including Tyson de Mexico increased 26.9%. Operating income for chicken decreased $66 million or 20.9% from 2000 primarily due to increased production costs and sales promotional expenses which more than offset increases in bulk leg quarter prices and certain other products. Pork segment sales were $619 million compared to $157 million last year, with current year case ready sales of $43 million. Pork segment operating profit increased $4 million from the same period last year. The increase in both pork segment sales and operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of nine weeks results for IBP. Prepared Foods segment sales totaled $818 million compared to $292 million last year. The prepared foods segment operating income increased $8 million from the same period last year. The increase in both the prepared foods segment sales and segment operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of nine weeks results related to IBP. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operations continues to be the Companys primary source of funds to finance operating requirements and capital expenditures. In 2002, net cash of $1,174 million was provided by operating activities, an increase of $663 million from 2001. The primary sources of the change are increases in net income of $295 million, depreciation and amortization of $132 million, and working capital of $165 million. The Companys foreseeable cash needs for operations and capital expenditures are expected to continue to be met through cash flows provided by operating activities Additionally at September 28, 2002, the Company had borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion consisting of $806 million available under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit agreements and $675 million under its $750 million accounts receivable securitization. At September 28, 2002, the Company had construction projects in progress that will require approximately $137 million to complete. Cash Provided by Operating Activities in millions 2002 2001 2000 $ 1,174 $ 511 $ 587 Total debt at September 28, 2002, was $3,987 million, a decrease of approximately $789 million from September 29, 2001. The Company has unsecured revolving credit agreements totaling $1 billion that support the Companys commercial paper program. These $1 billion in facilities consist of $200 million that expires in June 2003, $300 million that expires in June 2005 and $500 million that expires in September 2006. At September 28, 2002, there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities. Additional outstanding debt at September 28, 2002, consisted of $3.6 billion of debt securities, $75 million issued under accounts receivable securitization debt, $24 million of commercial paper and other indebtedness of $281 million. 27 Total Capitalization in millions 2002 2001 2000 Debt $ 3,987 $ 4,776 $ 1,542 Equity 3,662 3,354 2,175 The revolving credit agreement, senior notes, notes and accounts receivable securitization debt contain various covenants, the more restrictive of which contain a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with these covenants at fiscal year end. In October 2001, the Company refinanced $2.3 billion outstanding under a bridge financing facility through the issuance of $2.25 billion of notes offered in three tranches consisting of $500 million of 6.625% notes due October 2004, $750 million of 7.25% notes due October 2006 and $1 billion of 8.25% notes due October 2011. In October 2001, the Company entered into a receivables purchase agreement with three co purchasers to sell up to $750 million of trade receivables. The receivables purchase agreement has been accounted for as a borrowing and has an interest rate based on commercial paper issued by the co purchasers. Under this agreement, substantially all of the Companys accounts receivable are sold to a special purpose entity, Tyson Receivables Corporation (TRC), which is a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company. TRC has its own separate creditors that are entitled to be satisfied out of all of the assets of TRC prior to any value becoming available to TRCs equity holders. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142). Under SFAS 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, for impairment. Separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company elected to early adopt the provisions of SFAS 142 and discontinued the amortization of its goodwill balances and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives effective September 30, 2001. The Company assessed its goodwill for impairment upon adoption, and completed its required annual test for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Neither impairment test indicated any impairment losses. Had the provisions of SFAS 142 been in effect during fiscal years 2001 and 2000, a reduction in amortization expense and an increase to net income of $30 million or $0.14 per diluted share and $29 million or $0.13 per diluted share respectively, would have been recorded. In accordance with the guidance provided in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," and EITF Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products," beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company classifies the costs associated with sales incentives provided to retailers and payments such as slotting fees and cooperative advertising to vendors as a reduction in sales. These costs were previously included in selling, general and administrative expense. These reclassifications resulted in a reduction to sales and selling, general and administrative expense of approximately $188 million and $142 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2000, respectively, and had no impact on reported income before income taxes and minority interest, net income, or earnings per share amounts. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement requires the Company to recognize the fair value of a liability associated with the cost the Company would be obligated to incur in order to retire an asset at some point in the future. The liability would be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company expects to adopt this standard at the beginning of its fiscal 2003. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 develops an accounting model, based upon the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for long lived assets to be disposed by sales. The accounting model applies to all long lived assets, including discontinued operations, and it replaces the provisions of ABP Opinion No. 30, "Reporting Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for disposal of segments of a business. SFAS No. 144 requires 28 long lived assets held for disposal to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair values less costs to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company intends to adopt this standard at the beginning of its fiscal 2003. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces EITF Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. The statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the Company. Financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks, including certain livestock, interest rates and grain and feed costs. The Company may hold positions as economic hedges for which hedge accounting is not applied. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks. Contingent liabilities The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, cattle procurement, securities, environmental, product and other matters, and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Companys assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies, or other factors beyond the Companys control. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accrued self insurance Insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates. The assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management. However, actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of long lived assets The Company is required to assess potential impairments to its long lived assets, which is primarily property, plant and equipment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with SFAS 121 to determine if adjustments are to be recorded. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangible assets, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded. On September 30, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and was required to assess its goodwill for impairment issues upon adoption, and then at least annually thereafter. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, the Company enters into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings. Additionally, the Company held certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures and opt ions, for which it does not apply hedge accounting, but instead marks these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. In fiscal 2002, the Company changed its market risk disclosure type from a tabular presentation to a sensitivity analysis presentation. Due to the acquisition of IBP, the Companys commodity market risk became more diverse. As a result of a more complex risk profile, the Company believes a sensitivity analysis provides a clearer understanding of the risks associated with the Companys positions. The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities and hypothetical changes in exchange rates related to interest rates. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the Companys exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. Commodities Risk The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, primarily corn, soybeans and livestock. The Company periodically uses commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing commodity prices and as a mechanism to procure grains and livestock. Generally, contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, respectively, on fair value of open positions. The fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analy sis includes hedge and non hedge positions. The underlying commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative positions. Effect of 10% change in fair value dollars in millions 2002 2001 Livestock: Cattle $ 12 $ 14 Hogs 5 3 Grain $ 14 $ 4 Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to changes in interest rates on the companys fixed rate, long term debt. Market risk for fixed rate, long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, and amounts to approximately $75 million at September 28, 2002. The fair values of the Companys long term debt were estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the Companys incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The Company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments. Under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings. The maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from 2005 to 2008 with interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6.0%. Because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2002 and 2001. 30 Foreign Currency Risk The Company also periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure. The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge exposure to United States currency fluctuations inherent in its receivables and purchase commitments. The fair value of these contracts was not significant at September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001. Foreign forward contracts generally have maturities or expirations not exceeding 12 months. A 10% change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged would change the fair value of the contracts by $4 million at both September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. At September 28, 2002, approximately 10.8% of the Companys total accounts receivable balance was due from one customer. No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of total accounts receivable. 31
