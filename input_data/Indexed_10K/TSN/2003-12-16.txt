ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings for fiscal 2003 were $337 million or $0.96 per diluted share compared to $383 million or $1.08 per diluted share in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 pretax earnings include $167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and $76 million of costs related to the closing of poultry operations during the first, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. The Companys accounting cycle resulted in a 52 week year for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. 2003 vs. 2002 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. Sales increased $1.2 billion or 5.1%, with a slight increase in volume and a 5.0% increase in price. Cost of sales increased $1.3 billion or 5.8%. As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 92.9% for 2003 compared to 92.2% for 2002. This increase is primarily due to higher live cattle prices in the Beef segment, increases in grain costs in the Chicken segment and increased accruals related to ongoing litigation, partially offset by $167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $46 million or 5.4%. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 3.8% to 3.4%. The decrease is primarily due to the expense reductions of approximately $42 million related to the sale of Specialty Brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, and approximately $16 million associated with the ongoing integration of Tyson and IBP, inc. (IBP) corporate functions. Additional decreases were due to favorable investment returns of approximately $18 million on Company owned life insurance, actuarial gains of $13 million related to changes in certain retiree medical benefit plans and decreased litigation costs of approximately $19 million resulting primarily from the reversal of certain legal accruals which are no longer required due to cases being closed. The decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased professional fees of approximately $26 million primarily related to the Companys ongoing integration and strategic initiatives and increased sales promotions and marketing costs of approximately $45 million primarily due to the introduction and rollout of several new products. Other charges include $76 million of plant closing costs incurred in fiscal 2003, and $53 million of charges incurred in fiscal 2002 related to the discontinuation of the Thomas E. Wilson brand and the restructuring of the Companys live swine operations. Interest expense decreased $9 million or 2.8% compared to 2002, primarily resulting from an 8.2% decrease in the Companys average indebtedness. As a percent of sales, interest expense was 1.2% compared to 1.3% for 2002. The overall weighted average borrowing rate increased to 7.4% from 7.0%, primarily resulting from premiums paid on bonds repurchased in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. Excluding the premiums paid, interest expense decreased $21 million. Other expense increased $29 million from the same period last year, primarily resulting from the $10 million write down related to the impairment of an equity interest in a live swine operation recorded in fiscal 2003, and the prior year gain of $22 million from the sale of the Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary. The effective tax rate was 35.5% in both 2003 and 2002. Several factors impact the effective tax rate including average state income tax rates, the tax rates for international operations and the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales. Taxes on international earnings were comparable for 2003 and 2002. Average state taxes added 2.2% and 3% to the effective tax rate for 2003 compared to 2002 and ETI reduced the effective rate by 1.9% in 2003 compared to a 1.4% reduction in 2002. Various legislative bills have been introduced in 2003 which would repeal the ETI exclusion over a period of time, and replace ETI with a partial tax exclusion for certain domestic production activities. If the ETI exclusion is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted, 18 the loss of the ETI tax benefit may adversely impact the Companys effective tax rate. Segment Information Tyson operates in five business segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other. The Company measures segment profit as operating income. Chicken segment is primarily involved in the processing of live chickens into fresh, frozen and value added chicken products sold through domestic foodservice, domestic food retailers, wholesale club markets that service small foodservice operations, small businesses and individuals, as well as specialty and commodity distributors who deliver to restaurants, schools and international markets throughout the world. The Chicken segment also includes sales from allied products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary. Beef segment is primarily involved in the processing of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into primal and sub primal meat cuts and case ready products. It also involves deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to further processors and others. The Beef segment markets its products to food retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants, hotel chains and other food processors in domestic and international markets. Allied products are also marketed to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products. Pork segment is primarily involved in the processing of live market hogs and fabrication of pork carcasses into primal and sub primal meat cuts and case ready products. This segment also represents the Companys live swine group and related allied product processing activities. The Pork segment markets its products to food retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants, hotel chains and other food processors in domestic and international markets. It also sells allied products to pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as live swine and weaned and feeder pigs to pork producers. Prepared Foods segment includes the Companys operations that manufacture and market frozen and refrigerated food products. Products include pepperoni, beef and pork toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, hors doeuvres, desserts, prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes, specialty pasta and meat dishes as well as branded and processed meats. The Prepared Foods segment markets its products to food retailers, distributors, wholesalers, restaurants and hotel chains. Other segment includes the logistics group and other corporate activities not identified with specific protein groups.  Sales by Segment in millions   2003  2002  Change Chicken $ 7,427 $ 7,222 $ 205 Beef 11,935 10,488 1,447 Pork 2,470 2,503 (33) Prepared Foods 2,662 3,072 (410) Other 55 82 (27)  Total  $  24,549  $  23,367  $  1,182  Operating Income by Segment in millions   2003  2002  Change Chicken $ 158 $ 428 $ (270) Beef 320 220 100 Pork 75 25 50 Prepared Foods 57 158 (101) Other 227 56 171 Total $ 837 $ 887 $ (50) 19 Chicken segment sales increased $205 million or 2.8%, with a slight decrease in average sales prices and a 3.3% increase in volume. Foodservice chicken sales dollars increased 4.2%, retail chicken sales dollars increased 2.3% and international chicken sales dollars decreased 3.6%. Chicken segment operating income decreased $270 million from the same period last year primarily due to increased grain costs and plant closing costs. Beef segment sales increased $1.4 billion or 13.8%, with a 13.2% increase in average sales prices and a slight increase in volume. Case ready beef sales were $957 million and increased 20.4%, domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 11.8% and international beef sales increased 19.4%. Beef segment operating income increased $100 million. The Beef segment sales and operating income increases were caused by strong demand during the second half of fiscal 2003 caused in part by the U.S. ban on Canadian beef. However, these increases were partially offset by an increase in live cattle prices. Pork segment sales decreased $33 million or 1.3%, with a 2.9% increase in average sales prices and a 4.1% decrease in volume. Case ready pork sales were $221 million and increased 52.3%, domestic fresh meat pork sales decreased 3.5%, international pork sales increased 2.8% and live swine sales decreased 42.6%. Pork segment operating income increased $50 million. Excluding the fourth quarter 2002 live swine restructuring charge of $26 million, operating income increased $24 million. The decline in sales is primarily due to a reduction in live swine sales as a result of the prior year live swine restructuring and lower average selling prices for our finished product. Operating income was positively affected by the prior year restructuring of the live swine operation, partially offset by higher live hog prices. Prepared Foods segment sales decreased $410 million or 13.4%, with a 5.9% decrease in average sales prices and an 8.0% decrease in volume. Excluding prior year Specialty Brands sales of $244 million, segment sales declined $166 million and volume declined slightly. Segment operating income decreased $101 million from the same period last year. Excluding the prior year Thomas E. Wilson brand write down of $27 million, operating income declined $128 million. This decline results primarily from the increases during the year in raw material prices, lower average selling prices, increased costs related to the introduction of more than 75 new products this year and temporary operating inefficiencies at certain plants. Other segment operating income increased $171 million primarily due to settlements received in connection with the vitamin antitrust litigation. Current year results include $167 million as compared to $30 million received in fiscal 2002. Additionally, operating income was positively affected by actuarial gains of $13 million resulting from changes to certain retiree medical benefit plans. 2002 vs. 2001 On August 3, 2001, the Company acquired 50.1% ownership of IBP and acquired the remaining 49.9% on September 28, 2001. Accordingly, fiscal 2002 earnings include 52 weeks of IBPs results of operations, while fiscal 2001 fourth quarter and 12 months results include 50.1% of IBPs results for the nine weeks ended September 29, 2001. This information should be considered when comparing to fiscal 2001 results of operations. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. In accordance with the provisions issued in Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which the Company adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2002, goodwill and indefinite lived assets are no longer amortized. The effect on fiscal year 2001 results would have been an increase of approximately $0.14 cents per diluted share. In accordance with the guidance provided in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," and EITF Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products," beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company classifies the costs associated with sales incentives provided to retailers and payments such as slotting fees and cooperative advertising to vendors as a reduction in sales. These costs were previously included in selling, general and administrative expense. These reclassifications resulted in a reduction to sales and selling, general and administrative expense of approximately $188 million for fiscal year 2001, and had no impact on reported income before income taxes and minority interest, net income or earnings per share amounts. 20 Sales increased $13 billion or 121.2%, with a 98.9% increase in volume and an 11.2% increase in price. The increase in sales volume and price is primarily due to the inclusion of IBPs sales in fiscal 2002. Despite lower commodity prices, sales prices increased due to product mix changes as the Companys value added businesses grew. Cost of sales increased $12 billion or 123.1%, primarily due to the inclusion of IBPs cost of sales in fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 92.2% for 2002 compared to 91.5% for 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $290 million or 49.5%, primarily due to the inclusion of IBPs operations in fiscal 2002. As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 3.8% for 2002 compared to 5.6% in 2001. In its effort to integrate, restructure and reorganize, the Company improved efficiencies and lowered plant operating costs. These costs were also reduced through other cost containment efforts and improved sales expense management. Other charges include $27 million related to the discontinuation of the Thomas E. Wilson brand and $26 million related to the restructuring of the Companys live swine operation. Interest expense increased 111.8% compared to 2001. As a percent of sales, interest expense was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for 2001. The Companys average indebtedness increased by 109.7% over fiscal 2001 due to debt incurred to purchase IBP. The Companys short term interest rates decreased to 3.3% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 5.1% in fiscal 2001. The overall weighted average borrowing rate on total debt was 7.0% for fiscal 2002 compared to 6.9% for fiscal 2001. Other income increased in the current year due to a gain of $22 million from the sale of the Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary. The effective tax rate was 35.5% in 2002 compared to 35.4% in 2001. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142), at the beginning of 2002. Under SFAS No. 142 the Company no longer amortized goodwill which resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate for 2002, offset primarily by a reduction in the foreign sales benefit. Segment Information For the periods ending September 28, 2002, and September 29, 2001, the following information includes 100% of IBP results for 52 weeks and nine weeks, respectively. Information on segments is as follows:  Sales by Segment in millions   2002  2001  Change Chicken $ 7,222 $ 7,057 $ 165 Beef 10,488 2,027 8,461 Pork 2,503 619 1,884 Prepared Foods 3,072 818 2,254 Other 82 42 40  Total  $  23,367  $  10,563  $  12,804  Operating Income (Loss) by Segment in millions   2002  2001  Change Chicken $ 428 $ 250 $ 178 Beef 220 32 188 Pork 25 27 (2) Prepared Foods 158 15 143 Other 56 (8) 64 Total $ 887 $ 316 $ 571 Chicken segment sales increased $165 million or 2.3% compared to 2001, with a 1.1% increase in average sale prices and a 1.2% increase in volume. 21 Foodservice chicken sales increased 4.9%, retail chicken sales increased 2.0% and international chicken sales decreased 6.3%. In fiscal 2002, the Companys Mexican subsidiary sales increased 36.1% due to the acquisition of a production facility in Mexico in the third quarter of 2001. This increase was more than offset by decreases in other international sales demand as markets were impacted by import restrictions and political pressures primarily in Russia and China. Operating income for Chicken increased $178 million as compared to 2001, primarily due to decreases in live and production costs along with improvements in price and growth in value added product mix. Additionally, fiscal 2001 costs were negatively impacted by weather related effects and higher grain and energy costs. Beef segment sales were $10.5 billion, including beef case ready sales of $795 million and international beef sales of $1.4 billion. Beef segment operating income totaled $220 million. The Beef segment resulted from the acquisition of IBP in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Pork segment sales including IBPs pork processing revenues were $2.5 billion compared to $619 million in 2001, including fiscal 2002 pork case ready sales of $145 million and international pork sales of $248 million. Pork segment operating income decreased $2 million from 2001. Sales and operating income were positively affected by the inclusion of the IBP pork processing results in fiscal 2002. However, both were impacted by the negative results of the live swine operation. Operating income was also affected by the restructuring charge related to the Companys live swine operation of approximately $26 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Prepared Foods segment sales increased $2.3 billion compared to 2001. The Prepared Foods segment operating income increased $143 million. The increase in both sales and operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of IBP results. Operating income was also influenced by lower and more stable raw material prices and improvement in product mix. These increases were partially offset by the Thomas E. Wilson write down of $27 million related to the discontinuation of the brand. Other segment operating income increased $64 million primarily due to the partial settlement of approximately $30 million received in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 related to vitamin antitrust litigation combined with prior year IBP merger related expenses of $19 million. ACQUISITIONS In August 2001, the Company acquired 50.1% of IBP by paying approximately $1.7 billion in cash. In September 2001, the Company issued approximately 129 million shares of Class A stock, with a fair value of approximately $1.2 billion, to acquire the remaining IBP shares, and assumed approximately $1.7 billion of IBP debt. The total acquisition cost of approximately $4.6 billion was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accordingly, the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair values with the remainder of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price has been completed. In May 2002, the Company acquired the assets of Millard Processing Services, a bacon processing operation, for approximately $73 million in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase, and goodwill of approximately $14 million has been recorded. DISPOSITION In September 2002, the Company completed the sale of its Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary. The subsidiary had been acquired with the IBP acquisition and its results of operations were included in the Companys Prepared Foods segment. The Company received cash proceeds of approximately $131 million, which were used to reduce indebtedness, and recognized a pretax gain of $22 million. Specialty Brands, Inc.s sales and operating income for the year ended September 28, 2002, were $244 million and $2 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operations continues to be the Companys primary source of funds to finance operating requirements and capital expenditures. In 2003, net cash of $820 million was provided by operating activities, down $354 million from 2002. The decrease from fiscal 2002 is primarily due to a net change in working capital of $423 million and a decrease in net income of $46 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred taxes of $91 million. The change in working capital is primarily due to increased accounts receivable resulting from increased sales and increased inventory values, as well as the timing of cash receipts and payments related to other working capital items. The Companys foreseeable cash needs for operations and capital expenditures are expected to 22 continue to be met through cash flows provided by operating activities. Additionally, at September 27, 2003, the Company had borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion consisting of $705 million available under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities and $750 million under its accounts receivable securitization. At September 27, 2003, the Company had construction projects in progress that will require approximately $175 million to complete. Capital spending for fiscal 2004 is expected to be in the range of $450 to $500 million, which includes spending on plant automation as well as information systems technology improvements. Additionally, on December 5, 2003, the Company announced that in order to further improve long term manufacturing efficiencies, it will be closing facilities in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Augusta, Maine, in early 2004. The Company anticipates recording pretax charges related to these closings of approximately $23 to $27 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share in the first half of fiscal 2004.  Cash Provided by Operating Activities in millions 2003 2002 2001 $ 820 $ 1,174 $ 511 Total debt at September 27, 2003, was $3,604 million, a decrease of approximately $383 million from September 28, 2002. The Company has unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $1 billion that support the Companys commercial paper program. These $1 billion in facilities consist of $200 million that expire in June 2004, $300 million that expire in June 2005 and $500 million that expire in September 2006. At September 27, 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities. Additional outstanding debt at September 27, 2003, consisted of $3.3 billion of debt securities, $32 million of commercial paper and other indebtedness of $256 million.  Total Capitalization in millions 2003 2002 2001 Debt $ 3,604 $ 3,987 $ 4,776 Equity 3,954 3,662 3,354 The revolving credit facilities, senior notes, notes and accounts receivable securitization contain various covenants, the more restrictive of which contain a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with these covenants at fiscal year end. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations. The off balance sheet arrangements the Company has are guarantees of debt of outside third parties involving letters of credit, a lease, grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of these guarantees. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (the Interpretation). The Interpretation requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Currently, entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise that has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. The Interpretation was originally effective immediately for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and effective in the fourth quarter of the Companys fiscal 2003 for those created prior to February 1, 2003. However, in October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective date for those variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003, until the Companys first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company has substantially completed the process of evaluating the Interpretation and believes its adoption will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, "Amendment of Statement No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 149). SFAS No. 149 amends SFAS No. 133 to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative 23 instruments and hedging activities and requires that contracts with similar characteristics be accounted for on a comparable basis. The standard is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Companys adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity" (SFAS No. 150). SFAS No. 150 establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity and requires that such instruments be classified as liabilities. The standard is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective in the fourth quarter of the Companys fiscal 2003. The Companys adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the Company. Financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks, including certain livestock, natural gas, interest rates and grain and feed costs. The Company may hold positions as economic hedges for which hedge accounting is not applied. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks. Contingent liabilities The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, cattle procurement, securities, environmental, product and other matters, and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Companys assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the Companys control. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accrued self insurance Insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates. The assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management. However, actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized. Impairment of Long Lived assets The Company is required to assess potential impairments to its long lived assets, which are primarily property, plant and equipment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long Lived Assets," to determine if adjustments are to be recorded. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangible assets, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded. On September 30, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and was required to assess its goodwill for impairment issues upon adoption, and then at least annually thereafter. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, the Company enters into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is a hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as amended, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings. Additionally, the Company holds certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures and options, for which it does not apply hedge accounting, but instead marks these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities and hypothetical changes in exchange rates related to interest rates. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the Companys exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. Commodities Risk The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, such as corn, soybeans, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations. The Company uses commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. Generally, contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively, on fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions. The underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated. The following sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for livestock and natural gas and a direct impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for grain.  Effect of 10% change in fair value in millions 2003 2002 Livestock: Cattle $ 28 $ 12 Hogs 12 5 Grain $ 26 $ 14 Natural Gas $ 11 $ Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its fixed rate, long term debt. Market risk for fixed rate, long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, and amounts to approximately $62 million at September 27, 2003. The fair values of the Companys long term debt were estimated based upon quoted market prices and or published interest rates. The Company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments. Under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings. The maturity dates of these leveraged 25 equipment loans range from 2005 to 2008 with interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6.0%. Because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements, an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2003 and 2002. Foreign Currency Risk The Company also periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure. The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge exposure to U.S. currency fluctuations inherent in its receivables and purchase commitments. There were no such contracts outstanding at September 27, 2003, and the fair value of forward contracts at September 28, 2002, was not significant. Foreign forward contracts generally have maturities or expirations not exceeding 12 months. A 10% change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged at September 28, 2002, would have changed the fair value of the contracts by $4 million. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. At September 27, 2003, approximately 10.3% of the Companys net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer. No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable. 26
