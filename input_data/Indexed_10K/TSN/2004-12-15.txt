ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Tyson Foods is the worlds largest protein company and the second largest publicly traded food company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. Tyson produces, distributes and markets chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods and related allied products. The Companys primary operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors that influence the Companys business are customer demand for the Companys products, the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace, accessibility of international markets, market prices for the Companys chicken, beef and pork products, the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain and operating efficiencies of the Companys facilities. In August 2004, the Company introduced a new marketing and communication campaign "Powered by Tyson." This is the largest fully integrated marketing campaign in Tyson history and is supported by an investment of $75 million from the Companys annual marketing budget. To support the Companys goals of building its value added product portfolio, Tyson developed 400 new products this year. Additionally, the Company broke ground at its Corporate Center for the construction of facilities that will house expanded product development kitchens, a new pilot production plant, provide space for the consumer insights group and make provisions for team member development activities. In fiscal 2004, the Company achieved record sales and earnings, driven largely by the strong performance of the Companys Chicken and Pork segments. The Company continued to generate strong cash flow in fiscal 2004, as cash flow from operations increased $112 million from the prior year. This allowed the Company to pay down debt by $242 million in fiscal 2004, and exceed the debt to capital ratio goal of 45% by reaching 44% at year end. Earnings for fiscal 2004 were $403 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $337 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. The increase in earnings primarily was due to higher average selling prices, improved operating efficiencies in the Chicken segment, increased demand in the Chicken and Pork segments and improvements to the mix of our value added products. Earnings were negatively impacted by higher grain costs, partially offset by the Companys on going commodity risk management activities, higher raw material costs and the continued limited access to export markets. Also, fiscal 2004 pretax earnings included $40 million of costs, or $0.07 per diluted share, related to plant closings, $61 million of costs, or $0.11 per diluted share, of BSE related charges, $21 million of costs, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to fixed asset write downs and $25 million of costs, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the impairment of various intangible assets. Fiscal 2003 pretax earnings included $167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation, $76 million of costs related to plant closings and $10 million of charges related to the impairment of an equity interest in a live swine operation. The Companys accounting cycle resulted in a 53 week year for fiscal year 2004, and a 52 week year for fiscal years 2003 and 2002. Outlook The Companys goals for fiscal 2005 are to reduce the debt to capital ratio to 40%, improve the mix of value added products to over 40% of sales and improve the return on invested capital to 14%. Additionally, the Company anticipates expenses related to interest, foreign exchange and other charges to be approximately $250 million and the effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37%. Although uncertainty in global market conditions continues to make it difficult to predict future product demand, the Company believes the Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments will be strong in fiscal 2005; however, the Beef segment operations will continue to be difficult. The Company anticipates stronger export demand for chicken in fiscal 2005 due to the recent openings of the China and Japan markets, the liberalization of the Taiwanese market and the continuing emergence of the middle eastern and African markets. The Canadian border continues to be closed for live cattle; however, the U.S. government has recently initiated a review process to re open the Canadian border. Also, while there is a framework of an agreement for the resumption of trade with Japan, it appears trade will not resume for several months. Currently live weights of cattle being slaughtered are considerably higher than last year, indicating supplies of 19 Table of Contents cattle in the near term will be more abundant; however, until international market access is restored and live cattle are permitted from Canada, margins in the Beef segment will be negatively impacted. 2004 vs. 2003 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. Sales increased $1.9 billion or 7.7%, with a 9.4% increase in average price and a 1.5% decrease in volume. The increase in sales primarily is due to higher average selling prices. Volumes declined due to a reduction in international export activity related to the Chicken and Beef segments resulting from import restrictions imposed by various countries. Additionally, the Companys Beef segment domestic volumes decreased due to tightened supply of live cattle, the effects of higher beef pricing and significant competing protein supplies in the marketplace. Cost of sales increased $1.7 billion or 7.7%. As a percent of sales, cost of sales decreased from 92.9% to 92.8%. The increase in cost of sales is due primarily to increases in grain costs in the Chicken segment, which were partially offset by gains resulting from the Companys on going commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, and in the Beef segment, higher live cattle prices and BSE related charges. Also included in 2004 cost of sales were $18 million to reduce self insurance reserves to the actuarially determined range. The reserves are compared to actuarial estimates semi annually. The prior year had a $6 million reduction in self insurance reserves. Additionally, fiscal 2003 cost of sales included $167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $49 million or 5.9%. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 3.4% to 3.3%. The increase in expenses primarily was due to an increase in personnel and incentive based compensation of approximately $40 million, an increase of approximately $20 million related to information system technology improvements, an increase of approximately $21 million in employee benefit costs, primarily due to prior year actuarial gains of $13 million related to certain retiree medical benefit plans and current year increases in healthcare related costs. The increases were partially offset by a reduction in auditing, legal and professional fees of approximately $27 million, which included $12 million received in fiscal 2004 related to legal settlements from the Companys insurance providers. Other charges include plant closing costs of $40 million and $76 million recorded in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Fiscal 2004 costs were related primarily to the closings of the Companys Jackson, Mississippi, Manchester, New Hampshire and Augusta, Maine, facilities. As part of its on going plant rationalization efforts, the Company announced in February 2004 its decision to consolidate its manufacturing operations in Jackson, Mississippi, into the Companys Carthage, Mississippi, facility. The Company acquired the Carthage facility when it purchased Choctaw Maid Farms in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and, since that time, performed a comprehensive analysis of all operations in the area and determined this consolidation would most effectively maintain the Companys competitiveness in its Mississippi operations. In December 2003, the Company announced its decision to close its Manchester, New Hampshire, and Augusta, Maine, Prepared Foods operations to further improve long term manufacturing efficiencies. After thorough analysis, the Company determined that the amount of capital required to bring the Manchester and Augusta facilities to a competitive level and to maintain appropriate food safety standards, would be better spent to accommodate production in newer more modern facilities. The majority of the Manchester and Augusta production was consolidated into other Company facilities. The prior year costs were related to the closings of the Companys Berlin, Maryland, Stilwell, Oklahoma and Jacksonville, Florida, facilities. Also included in other charges for fiscal 2004 were $25 million in charges related to the impairment of various intangible assets and $21 million related to fixed asset write downs. The impairment charges apply primarily to trademarks acquired in the acquisition of Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (TFM; formerly known as IBP, inc.) in 2001. These impairment charges resulted primarily from lower product sales under some of the Companys regional trademarks as products are increasingly being sold under the Tyson trademark. The fair value of the Companys trademarks is determined using a royalty rate method based on expected revenues by trademark. The trademarks, as well as all other intangible assets, are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The fixed asset write down was the result of the Company implementing a control whereby all plant facilities conduct fixed asset inventories on a recurring basis. Interest expense decreased $21 million or 7.1%, primarily resulting from an 8.2% decrease in the Companys average indebtedness. The Company incurred $13 million of expenses in each fiscal year of 2004 and 2003, related to the on going efforts to buy back bonds at attractive prices when available in the market and to the early redemption of Tyson de Mexico preferred shares. The overall weighted average borrowing rate increased to 7.7% from 7.4%, primarily due to the fiscal 2004 reduction of short term debt which carried lower interest rates. 20 Table of Contents Other expense decreased $3 million from the same period last year, primarily resulting from the $10 million write down related to the impairment of an equity interest in a live swine operation recorded in fiscal 2003. This decrease was partially offset by increased foreign exchange losses of approximately $9 million from the Companys Canadian operation in fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate increased from 35.5% in fiscal 2003 to 36.6% in fiscal 2004. The estimated Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) amount reduced the 2004 effective tax rate by 0.5% compared to 1.9% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the 2004 estimated ETI benefit resulted from a reduction in the estimated 2004 profit from export sales primarily due to the effects of BSE and avian influenza, along with an adjustment to the estimated 2003 benefit. The 2004 estimated rate also increased due to the expiration of certain general business credits. On October 22, 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which provides, among other things, for the repeal of the ETI benefit phased in from 2004 through 2006. The Act also provided for a domestic production deduction which will be available to the Company beginning in the 2006 fiscal year. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the Act. Segment Information Tyson operates in five business segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other. The Company measures segment profit as operating income. Chicken segment is involved primarily in the processing of live chickens into fresh, frozen and value added chicken products. The Chicken segment markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world. The Chicken segment also includes sales from allied products and the chicken breeding stock subsidiary. Beef segment is involved primarily in the processing of live fed cattle and fabrication of dressed beef carcasses into primal and sub primal meat cuts and case ready products. It also involves deriving value from allied products such as hides and variety meats for sale to further processors and others. The Beef segment markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world. Allied products are also marketed to manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and technical products. Pork segment is involved primarily in the processing of live market hogs and fabrication of pork carcasses into primal and sub primal meat cuts and case ready products. This segment also represents the Companys live swine group and related allied product processing activities. The Pork segment markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world. It also sells allied products to pharmaceutical and technical products manufacturers, as well as live swine to pork producers. Prepared Foods segment includes the Companys operations that manufacture and market frozen and refrigerated food products. Products include pepperoni, beef and pork toppings, pizza crusts, flour and corn tortilla products, appetizers, prepared meals, ethnic foods, soups, sauces, side dishes and meat dishes, as well as branded and processed meats. The Prepared Foods segment markets its products domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors, restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, hotel chains, healthcare facilities, the military and other food processors, as well as to international markets throughout the world. Other segment includes the logistics group and other corporate activities not identified with specific protein groups. 21 Table of Contents  Sales by Segment in millions Sales 2004 Sales 2003 Sales Change Volume Change Avg.

Foodservice chicken sales increased 11.3%, retail chicken sales increased 16.2% and international chicken sales increased 14.5%. Excluding plant closing related accruals of $13 million and $76 million recorded in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, and fixed asset write downs of $13 million recorded in fiscal 2004, operating income increased $340 million. Sales and operating income increases primarily are due to increased average selling prices and sales volumes, as well as improvements in product mix and operating efficiencies. Operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $239 million of increased grain costs, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $127 million from the Companys on going commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases. The increase in the Companys domestic Chicken segment sales volumes in fiscal 2004 was partially offset by decreased international sales volumes due to import restrictions by various countries caused by the avian influenza outbreaks in the United States. Beef segment sales increased 0.1% in fiscal 2004 as compared to the same period last year. Domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 6.0%, international beef sales decreased 31.6% and case ready beef sales increased 18.0%. Operating income for fiscal 2004 includes BSE related charges of $61 million and $5 million of charges related to the impairment of various intangible assets and fixed asset write downs. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by increases in live cattle prices, production declines and decreased capacity utilization. These decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices and increased volumes and margins at the Companys Lakeside operation in Canada. Pork segment sales increased 28.9% in fiscal 2004 as compared to the same period last year. Domestic fresh meat pork sales increased 26.1%, international pork sales increased 60.2%, case ready pork sales increased 29.4% and live swine sales of Company owned hogs decreased 14.8%. The increase in the Pork segments operating income primarily was due to higher average selling prices and increased demand as pork benefited from stronger domestic and international markets, more than offsetting increases in live hog costs. Operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $1 million related to fixed asset write downs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Prepared Foods segment sales increased 7.3% in fiscal 2004 as compared to the same period last year. Foodservice prepared foods sales increased 13.2%, international prepared foods sales increased 16.0% and retail prepared foods sales increased 0.5%. Fiscal 2004 operating income increased $25 million, excluding plant closing costs of approximately $27 million, the impairment of various intangible assets of $22 million and fixed asset write downs of $5 million, all of which were recorded in fiscal 2004. The increase in the Prepared Foods segments operating income primarily was due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes, partially offset by increased raw material prices. Other segment operating income decreased $145 million primarily due to settlements of $167 million received in 2003 in 22 Table of Contents connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Additionally in 2003, operating income was affected positively by actuarial gains of $13 million resulting from certain retiree medical benefit plans. 2003 vs. 2002 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. Sales increased $1.2 billion or 5.1%, with a slight increase in volume and a 5.0% increase in price. Cost of sales increased $1.3 billion or 5.8%. As a percent of sales, cost of sales was 92.9% for 2003 compared to 92.2% for 2002. This increase primarily is due to higher live cattle prices in the Beef segment, increases in grain costs in the Chicken segment and increased accruals related to on going litigation, partially offset by $167 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $46 million or 5.4%. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 3.8% to 3.4%. The decrease primarily is due to the expense reductions of approximately $42 million related to the sale of Specialty Brands, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, and approximately $16 million associated with the integration of Tyson and Tyson Fresh Meats corporate functions. Additional decreases were due to favorable investment returns of approximately $18 million on Company owned life insurance, actuarial gains of $13 million related to certain retiree medical benefit plans and decreased litigation costs of approximately $19 million resulting primarily from the reversal of certain legal accruals which are no longer required due to cases being closed. The decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased professional fees of approximately $26 million, primarily related to the Companys on going integration and strategic initiatives, and increased sales promotions and marketing costs of approximately $45 million, primarily due to the introduction and rollout of several new products. Other charges include $76 million of plant closing costs incurred in fiscal 2003, and $53 million of charges incurred in fiscal 2002 related to the discontinuation of the Thomas E. Wilson brand and the restructuring of the Companys live swine operations. Interest expense decreased $9 million or 2.8% compared to 2002, primarily resulting from an 8.2% decrease in the Companys average indebtedness. As a percent of sales, interest expense was 1.2% compared to 1.3% for 2002. The overall weighted average borrowing rate increased to 7.4% from 7.0%, primarily resulting from premiums paid on bonds repurchased in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. Excluding the premiums paid, interest expense decreased $21 million. Other expense increased $29 million, primarily resulting from the $10 million write down related to the impairment of an equity interest in a live swine operation recorded in fiscal 2003, and the gain of $22 million from the sale of the Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary recorded in fiscal 2002. The effective tax rate was 35.5% in both 2003 and 2002. Several factors impacted the effective tax rate including average state income tax rates, the tax rates for international operations and the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales. Taxes on international earnings were comparable for 2003 and 2002. Average state taxes added 2.2% and 3.0% to the effective tax rate for 2003 compared to 2002, and ETI reduced the effective rate by 1.9% in 2003 compared to a 1.4% reduction in 2002.

Foodservice chicken sales increased 4.2%, retail chicken sales increased 2.3% and international chicken sales decreased 3.6%. Excluding plant closing costs of $76 million recorded in fiscal 2003, operating income decreased $194 million. This decrease results primarily from higher grain costs as compared to fiscal 2002. Beef segment sales increased 13.8% compared to fiscal 2002. Domestic fresh meat beef sales increased 11.8%, international beef sales increased 19.4% and case ready beef sales increased 20.4%. Beef segment operating income increased $100 million. The Beef segment sales and operating income increases were caused by strong demand during the second half of fiscal 2003 caused in part by the U.S. ban on Canadian beef. However, these increases were partially offset by an increase in live cattle prices. Pork segment sales decreased 1.3% compared to fiscal 2002. Domestic fresh meat pork sales decreased 3.5%, international pork sales increased 2.8%, case ready pork sales increased 52.3% and live swine sales decreased 42.6%. Excluding the fourth quarter 2002 live swine restructuring charge of $26 million, operating income increased $24 million. The decline in sales primarily is due to a reduction in live swine sales as a result of the fiscal 2002 live swine restructuring and lower average selling prices for our finished product. Operating income was positively affected by the restructuring of the live swine operation, partially offset by higher live hog prices. Prepared Foods segment sales decreased 13.4% compared to fiscal 2002. Excluding fiscal 2002 Specialty Brands, Inc. sales of $244 million, segment sales decreased $166 million and 5.9% and volume declined slightly. Segment operating income decreased $128 million excluding the Thomas E. Wilson brand write down of $27 million recorded in fiscal 2002. This decrease results primarily from the increases in raw material prices, lower average selling prices, increased costs related to the introduction of more than 75 new products in fiscal 2003 and temporary operating inefficiencies at certain plants. Other segment operating income increased $171 million primarily due to settlements received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Fiscal 2003 operating income includes $167 million as compared to $30 million received in fiscal 2002. Additionally, operating income was positively affected by actuarial gains recorded in fiscal 2003 of $13 million resulting from certain retiree medical benefit plans. ACQUISITIONS In September 2003, the Company purchased Choctaw Maid Farms, Inc. (Choctaw), an integrated poultry processor. Since 1992, Tyson had been purchasing all of Choctaws production under a "cost plus" supply agreement, which was scheduled to expire in 2007. The Company had previously negotiated a purchase option with Choctaws owners, which initially became exercisable in 2002. The Company decided to exercise its purchase option rather than continue under the "cost plus" arrangement of the supply agreement. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141). Accordingly, the assets and liabilities were adjusted for fair values with the remainder of the purchase price, $18 million, recorded as goodwill. The purchase price consisted of $1 million cash to exercise the purchase option in Tysons supply agreement with Choctaw and the settlement of $85 million owed to Tyson by Choctaw. In addition, the Company assumed approximately $4 million of Choctaws debt to a third party. In June 2003, the Company exercised a $74 million purchase option to acquire assets leased from a third party which the Company had subleased to Choctaw. Pro forma operating results reflecting the acquisition of Choctaw would not be materially different from the Companys actual results of operations. 24 Table of Contents In May 2002, the Company acquired the assets of Millard Processing Services, a bacon processing operation, for approximately $73 million in cash. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and goodwill of approximately $14 million was recorded. DISPOSITION In September 2002, the Company completed the sale of its Specialty Brands, Inc. subsidiary. The subsidiary had been acquired with the TFM acquisition, and its results of operations were included in the Companys Prepared Foods segment. The Company received cash proceeds of approximately $131 million, which were used to reduce indebtedness, and recognized a pretax gain of $22 million. Specialty Brands, Inc.s sales and operating income for the year ended September 28, 2002, were $244 million and $2 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operations continues to be the Companys primary source of funds to finance operating requirements and capital expenditures. In 2004, net cash of $932 million was provided by operating activities, up $112 million from 2003. The increase from fiscal 2003 primarily is due to the increase of $98 million from net income, excluding the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization. The Companys foreseeable cash needs for operations growth and capital expenditures are expected to continue to be met through cash flows provided by operating activities. Additionally, at October 2, 2004, the Company had borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion consisting of $640 million available under its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities and $450 million under its accounts receivable securitization. At October 2, 2004, the Company had construction projects in progress that will require approximately $492 million to complete. Capital spending for fiscal 2005 is expected to be in the range of $600 to $680 million, which reflects additional spending for a third fully dedicated case ready plant, a new Corporate Center and a variety of projects that will increase automation and support value added product growth. The Company continues to evaluate potential international and domestic growth opportunities.  Cash Provided by Operating Activities in millions 2004 2003 2002 $ 932 $ 820 $ 1,174 Total debt at October 2, 2004, was $3.4 billion, a decrease of $242 million from September 27, 2003. The Company has unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $1 billion that support the Companys commercial paper program, letters of credit and other short term funding needs. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company restructured and extended its revolving credit facilities. These $1 billion in facilities now consist of $250 million that expire in September 2006 and $750 million that expire in June 2009. At October 2, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities. Outstanding debt at October 2, 2004, consisted of $2.8 billion of debt securities, $300 million under the receivables purchase agreement, $86 million of commercial paper and other indebtedness of $160 million.  Total Capitalization in millions 2004 2003 2002 Debt $ 3,362 $ 3,604 $ 3,987 Equity 4,292 3,954 3,662 The revolving credit facilities, senior notes, notes and accounts receivable securitization contain various covenants, the more restrictive of which contain a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with all of its covenants at fiscal year end. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations. The off balance sheet arrangements the Company has are guarantees of debt of outside third parties involving a lease, grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of these guarantees. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of October 2, 2004: 25 Table of Contents  in millions Payments Due by Period Less than One to Three to More than one year three years five years five years Total Debt and capital lease obligations: Principal payments (1) $ 338 $ 1,309 $ 105 $ 1,610 $ 3,362 Interest payments (2) 213 297 295 456 1,261 Guarantees (3) 2 3 2 48 55 Operating lease obligations (4) 63 68 25 2 158 Purchase obligations (5) 220 58 4 5 287 Capital expenditures (6) 347 121 24 492 Other long term liabilities (7) 4 9 7 50 70 Total contractual commitments $ 1,187 $ 1,865 $ 462 $ 2,171 $ 5,685 (1) In the event of a default on payment or violation of debt covenants, acceleration of the principal payments would occur. At October 2, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. (2) Interest payments include only interest payments on fixed rate and fixed term debt, based on the expected payment dates. The Company has other interest obligations on variable rate, non term debt; however, these obligations have been excluded, as the timing of payments and expected interest rates cannot be reasonably estimated. (3) Amounts included are for the guarantees of outside third parties, which involve a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments (4) Amounts included in operating lease obligations are minimum lease payments under lease agreements, as well as residual guarantee amounts. (5) Amounts included in purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Included in the purchase obligations amount are future purchase commitments for corn, soybeans, livestock and natural gas contracts that provide terms that meet the above criteria. The Company has excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is not considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded. (6) Amounts included in capital expenditures are estimated amounts to complete construction projects in progress as of October 2, 2004. (7) Amounts included in other long term liabilities are items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, "Inventory Costs" (SFAS No. 151). SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility, freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges. Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. On October 22, 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Bill). The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the Bill. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03 6, "Participating Securities and the Two Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share." This issue involves the computation of earnings per share for companies that have multiple classes of common stock or have issued securities other than common stock that participate in dividends with common stock (participating securities). The EITF concluded that companies 26 Table of Contents having participating securities are required to apply the two class method to compute earnings per share. The two class method is an earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. The Company adopted EITF Issue No. 03 6 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. As required by EITF Issue No. 03 6, prior period earnings per share have been restated as follows:  2003 2002 Earnings per share as previously reported Basic $ 0.98 $ 1.10 Diluted 0.96 1.08 Earnings per share, restated in accordance with EITF Issue No. 03 6 Class A Basic 1.00 1.13 Class B Basic 0.90 1.02 Diluted 0.96 1.08 In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" (SFAS No. 132). The revision of SFAS No. 132 requires expanded disclosures for defined benefit plans. The standards revisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for pensions and other postretirement benefits disclosures. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed. The Act allows a possible subsidy to retirement health plan sponsors to help offset the costs of participant prescription drug benefits. In March 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 106 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Act" (the Position). The Position is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2004. The Position allows plan sponsors to recognize or defer recognizing the effects of the Act in its financial statements. Specific accounting guidance for this federal subsidy is pending and, when issued, could require the Company to change previously reported information. The Companys accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost do not reflect the effects of the Act. The Company has elected to defer accounting for the Act and has estimated any future effect on its consolidated financial statements will not be material. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (the Interpretation). The Interpretation requires the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE) in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Previously, entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise that had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision of the Interpretation (the Revised Interpretation 46). Revised Interpretation 46 codifies both the proposed modifications and other decisions previously issued through certain FASB Staff Positions and supersedes the original Interpretation to include: (1) deferring the effective date of the Interpretations provisions for certain variable interests, (2) providing additional scope exceptions for certain other variable interests, (3) clarifying the impact of troubled debt restructurings on the requirement to reconsider (a) whether an entity is a VIE or (b) which party is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and (4) revising Appendix B of the original Interpretation to provide additional guidance on what constitutes a variable interest. Under the new guidance, application of the Revised Interpretation 46 is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, and for all other types of variable interest entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The Companys adoption of Revised Interpretation 46 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 27 Table of Contents the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the Company. Financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks, including certain livestock, interest rates, grain and feed costs, natural gas and other commodities used in the normal course of operations. The Company may also hold positions for which hedge accounting, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as amended, is not applied. Derivative financial instruments must be marked to market as of the end of each quarter in which the positions exist. As the commodities underlying the Companys derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 could result in volatility in the Companys results of operations. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks. Contingent liabilities The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, livestock procurement, securities, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Companys assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the Companys control. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accrued self insurance Insurance expense for health and welfare, workers compensation, auto liability and general liability risks are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates. The assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management. However, actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized. Impairment of Long Lived assets The Company is required to assess potential impairments to its long lived assets, which are primarily property, plant and equipment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long Lived Assets," to determine if adjustments are to be recorded. Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangible assets, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded. The Company assesses its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This report and other public communications issued by the Company from time to time include certain non GAAP financial measures, which are defined as numerical measures of a companys financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Companys financial statements. Non GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of operating income and other GAAP measures of operating performance that exclude or include the effect of the closings of selected operations, BSE related charges, fixed asset write downs, impairment charges related to various intangible assets, litigation settlements and other similar events. The Companys management believes these non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the Companys earnings. Management also believes that the presentation of these non GAAP financial measures is consistent with its past practice, as well as industry practice in general, and will enable investors and analysts to compare current non GAAP measures with non GAAP measures presented in prior periods. The non GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS MARKET RISKS Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, the Company enters into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is a hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales. Additionally, the Company holds certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures which do not meet the criteria for SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting. These positions are marked to fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. The changes in market value of derivatives used in the Companys risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales. The changes in market value of derivatives used in the Companys risk management activities surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the Companys exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. Commodities Risk The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, such as corn, soybeans, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations. The Company uses commodity futures to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying the Companys derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 could result in volatility in the Companys results of operations. Generally, contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively, on fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions. The underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated. The following sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for livestock and natural gas and a direct impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for grain.  Effect of 10% change in fair value in millions 2004 2003 Livestock: Cattle $ 12 $ 28 Hogs 18 12 Grain 5 26 Natural Gas 13 11 Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its fixed rate, long term debt. Market risk for fixed rate, long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, and amounts to approximately $51 million at October 2, 2004, and $62 million at September 27, 2003. The fair values of the Companys long term debt were estimated based upon quoted market prices and or published interest rates. The Company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments. Under the terms of 29 Table of Contents various leveraged equipment loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings. The maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from 2005 to 2008 with interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6.0%. Because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements, an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years 2004 and 2003. Foreign Currency Risk The Company has non cash foreign exchange gain/loss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of certain receivables and payable balances. The primary currency exchanges the Company has exposure to are the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the European euro, the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real. The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure. There were no such contracts outstanding at October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Companys cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. At October 2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, approximately 15.0% and 10.3%, respectively, of the Companys net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer. No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable. 30 Table of Contents
