ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Tyson Foods is the worlds largest meat protein company and the second largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. Tyson produces, distributes and markets chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. The Companys operations are conducted in five segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and Other. Some of the key factors that influence the Companys business are customer demand for the Companys products, the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace, accessibility of international markets, market prices for the Companys chicken, beef and pork products, the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain and operating efficiencies of the Companys facilities. The Company faced very challenging operating conditions in fiscal 2006. Demand pressures caused mainly by outbreaks of avian influenza, primarily in Europe and Asia, Hurricane Katrina and other export market disruptions in the Companys Chicken and Beef segments, led to an oversupply of proteins worldwide and negatively affected the average sales prices and operating results of each of the Companys protein segments. Operations also were affected negatively by higher energy costs, and significant operating margin reductions at the Companys operations in Canada and Mexico. Net loss for fiscal 2006 was $196 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to earnings of $372 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. Pretax loss for fiscal 2006 includes $63 million of costs related to beef, prepared foods and poultry plant closings and $19 million of charges related to the Companys $200 million cost reduction initiative and other business consolidation efforts. These charges include severance expenses, product rationalization costs and related intangible asset impairment expenses. Additionally, the Company completed a review of its tax account balances, and as a result, recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of approximately $15 million. Also, net loss for fiscal 2006 includes a charge of $5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. Combined, these items increased fiscal 2006 diluted loss per share by $0.21. Pretax earnings for fiscal 2005 include $33 million of costs related to a legal settlement involving the Companys live swine operations, $14 million of costs for poultry and prepared foods plant closings, $8 million of losses related to Hurricane Katrina, $12 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and a gain of $8 million from the sale of the Companys remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. Net income in fiscal 2005 includes a non recurring income tax net benefit of $15 million. The net benefit includes the reversal of tax reserves, partially offset by an income tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign income. The effective tax rate of the Company was affected further by the federal income tax effect of the Medicare Part D subsidy in fiscal 2005 of $55 million because this amount is not subject to federal income tax. Combined, these items increased fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share by $0.03. The Companys accounting cycle resulted in a 52 week year for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, and a 53 week year for fiscal 2004. Outlook Managements primary goal during this difficult operating environment is to return the Company to profitability. One of the measures being taken to achieve this goal is to manage and reduce costs. The Company initiated a $200 million cost reduction initiative in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Approximately 90% of the initiative has been implemented, and the Company began realizing savings in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 26 TYSON FOODS, INC. Although returning the Company to profitability is its primary short term goal, management also remains focused on the following primary elements of its long term strategy: creating more value added products, improving operational efficiencies and expanding internationally. During the year, the Company strongly examined its business as well as various opportunities and took the necessary steps to better position itself to meet its long term goals. The Companys Discovery Center is nearing completion and should be operational in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The Discovery Center is expected to bring new market leading retail and foodservice products to the customer faster and more effectively. It is a state of the art facility, which includes 19 research centers as well as a USDA inspected pilot plant. In fiscal 2006, the Company announced the rationalization of three beef plants and two prepared foods plants. Additionally, the Company completed several major capital projects in fiscal 2006, including a case ready plant in Sherman, Texas, and an expansion at the Dakota City, Nebraska, location. The Company realized certain operational efficiencies in fiscal 2006 related to its rationalization and expansion efforts and expects continued efficiencies in fiscal 2007. In November 2006, the Company announced a new business unit, Tyson Renewable Energy, which has been exploring ways to commercialize the Companys supply of animal fat into bio fuels. The new unit also is examining the potential use of poultry litter to generate energy and other products. With regard to the Companys international expansion goals, the Company expects to close on a transaction during fiscal 2007, which would establish a joint venture with a poultry company in China. Additionally, the Company expects to complete two joint venture transactions in South America in 2007; one involving a poultry operation in Brazil, and the other involving a beef operation in Argentina. The Company expects operating margin improvements in each segment in fiscal 2007. Although the Companys Chicken segment will be affected negatively by higher grain prices in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, the Companys mix of value added products and expected price increases should supply some insulation. The Company expects live cattle supplies and live hog supplies to increase in fiscal 2007, which should allow the Company to achieve greater operational efficiencies in its processing plants. Additionally, the Company anticipates improved market share in the Prepared Foods segment in fiscal 2007. Based on the Companys outlook for fiscal 2007, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.80, and sales are estimated to be in the range of $26 billion to $27 billion. The Company expects to reduce its capital spending from the $531 million spent in fiscal 2006 to approximately $400 million in fiscal 2007. Additionally, the Company anticipates stronger cash flow and lower interest expense in fiscal 2007 and plans to use the improved cash flow to reduce its debt position. 2006 vs. 2005 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. Sales decreased $455 million or 1.7%, with a 3.9% decrease in average sales price and a 2.3% increase in volume. The oversupply of proteins led to decreased average sales prices in all segments. Additionally, fiscal 2006 sales were affected negatively by realized and unrealized net losses of $5 million, compared to realized and unrealized net gains of $24 million recorded in fiscal 2005 from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef and pork sales. Cost of Sales increased $337 million or 1.4%. As a percent of sales, cost of sales increased from 93.4% to 96.4%. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales primarily was due to the decrease in average sales prices, while average live prices and production costs did not decrease at the same rate. Energy costs increased in all segments by approximately $167 million compared to the same period last year. Additionally, fiscal 2006 includes $49 million of realized and unrealized net losses related to the Companys forward futures contracts for live cattle and hog purchases, compared to $33 million of realized and unrealized net gains recorded in fiscal 2005. Cost of sales was impacted positively by realized and unrealized net gains of $6 million in fiscal 2006 resulting from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $27 million in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7 million or 0.8%. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 3.6% to 3.7%. The increase primarily was due to an increase in stock compensation expense, information system services costs and increased sales promotion expenses. The increases were offset partially by decreased charitable contributions, decreased legal and other professional fees and a fiscal 2006 bad debt recovery. Also, insurance proceeds received in fiscal 2005 decreased prior year costs. 27 TYSON FOODS, INC. Other charges include $63 million of plant closing related costs and $9 million of severance accruals related to the Companys $200 million cost reduction initiative. The plant closing costs relate primarily to closing the Companys Norfolk and West Point, Nebraska, and Independence and Oelwein, Iowa, operations. In February 2006, the Company announced its decision to close its Norfolk, Nebraska, beef processing plant and its West Point, Nebraska, beef slaughter plant. These facilities closed in February 2006. Production from these facilities shifted primarily to the Companys beef complex in Dakota City, Nebraska. In January 2006, the Company announced its decision to close two of its processed meats facilities in northeast Iowa. The Independence and Oelwein plants, which produced chopped ham and sliced luncheon meats, closed in March 2006. In August 2006, the Company announced its decision to close its Boise, Idaho, beef slaughter plant and to scale back processing operations at its Pasco, Washington, complex. This decision resulted in the elimination of approximately 770 positions. The closure and process change occurred in October 2006 and did not result in a significant charge to the Company. In July 2006, the Company announced its decision to implement approximately $200 million in cost reductions as part of a strategy to return to profitability. The cost reductions include staffing costs, consulting and professional fees, sales and marketing costs and other expenses. Virtually all of the cost reduction initiatives are expected to be completed by December 2006, with savings beginning principally in fiscal 2007. Other charges in fiscal 2005 include $33 million relating to a legal settlement involving the Companys live swine operations and $14 million in plant closing costs primarily relating to the closings of the Companys Cleveland Street Forest, Mississippi; Portland, Maine; and Bentonville, Arkansas; operations. In July 2005, the Company announced it had agreed to settle a lawsuit resulting from the restructuring of its live swine operations. The settlement resulted in the Company recording an additional $33 million of costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. In July 2005, the Company announced its decision to make improvements to one of its Forest, Mississippi, facilities, which included more product lines, enabling the plant to increase production of processed and marinated chicken. The improvements were made at the former Choctaw Maid Farms location, which the Company acquired in fiscal 2003. The Companys Cleveland Street Forest, Mississippi, poultry operation ceased operations in March 2006. Also in July 2005, the Company announced its decision to close its Bentonville, Arkansas, facility. The production from this facility was transferred to the Companys Russellville, Arkansas, poultry plant, where an expansion enabled the facility to absorb the Bentonville facilitys production. In December 2004, the Company announced its decision to close its Portland, Maine, facility. The plant ceased operations February 4, 2005, and the production from this facility was transferred to other locations. Interest income increased $20 million, primarily due to the interest earned on the $750 million short term investment held on deposit with a trustee used for the repayment of the 7.25% Notes maturing on October 1, 2006. Interest expense increased $31 million or 13.1%. The increase primarily was due to the increase in average total debt of 15.8%; however, average total debt increased by approximately 3.2% after adjusting total debt for the $750 million short term investment. The increase was offset partially by a decrease in the overall weighted average borrowing rate from 7.1% to 7.0%. Other income increased $12 million compared to fiscal 2005, primarily resulting from improvements in foreign currency exchange gain/loss activity of approximately $7 million and a $7 million gain recorded on the write off of a capital lease obligation related to a legal settlement. These items were offset partially by an $8 million gain recorded in fiscal 2005 from the sale of the Companys remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. The effective tax rate was a 34.8% benefit for fiscal 2006 compared to a 29.5% provision for fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2006 effective tax rate was reduced by 5.1% due to expense recorded in fiscal 2006 as a result of the tax account balance review as discussed in Note 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The fiscal 2006 effective rate also was reduced by 1.8% due to the federal income tax effect of the Medicare Part D subsidy loss for fiscal 2006 since this loss is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. The fiscal 2005 effective rate reflects a reduction of 4.1% due to the release of income tax reserves that management deemed were no longer required and a reduction of 3.6% related to the 2005 estimated future Medicare Part D subsidy. In addition, the fiscal 2005 effective rate reflected an increase of 4.2% relating to the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries as allowed by the American Jobs Creation Act. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax, includes a transition charge of $5 million related to the Companys adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. 28 TYSON FOODS, INC.

Chicken segment sales decreased 4.4% and operating results decreased $529 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 operating results include charges of $9 million related to the Companys cost reduction initiative, other business consolidation efforts and plant closing costs. Fiscal 2005 operating results include $12 million of plant closing costs and $8 million of hurricane related losses. The decline in sales and operating results primarily was due to lower average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace. Additionally, the Chicken segments operating results were affected negatively by higher energy costs and decreased margins at the Companys operations in Mexico. Fiscal 2006 chicken operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $6 million from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $27 million recorded in fiscal 2005. Beef segment sales increased 1.8% and operating results decreased $284 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 operating results include charges of $52 million related to plant closing costs, the Companys cost reduction initiative and other business consolidation efforts. Fiscal 2005 operating results include $10 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. The operating results decline primarily was due to lower average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace. Additionally, the Beef segments operating results were affected negatively by significant operating margin reductions at the Companys Lakeside operation in Canada. Also, fiscal 2006 operating results include realized and unrealized net losses of $40 million from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef sales and forward live cattle purchases, compared to realized and unrealized net gains of $13 million recorded in fiscal 2005. Pork segment sales decreased 5.8% and operating results remained flat in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 operating results include charges of $2 million related to the Companys cost reduction initiative and other business consolidation efforts. Fiscal 2005 operating results include $33 million related to a legal settlement involving the Companys live swine operations and $2 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Lower average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace adversely affected sales and operating results. The lower average sales prices were offset partially by lower average live prices. Additionally, fiscal 2006 operating results include realized and unrealized net losses of $15 million from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed pork sales and forward live hog purchases, compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $22 million recorded in fiscal 2005. Prepared Foods segment sales decreased 3.9% and operating results decreased $33 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 operating results include charges of $19 million related to plant closing costs, other business consolidation efforts and the Companys cost reduction initiative. Fiscal 2005 operating results include $2 million related to plant closing costs. The decline in sales and operating income primarily was due to lower average sales prices. 2005 vs. 2004 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current presentations. Sales decreased $427 million or 1.6%, with a 0.7% increase in average sales price and a 2.3% decrease in volume. The decrease in sales primarily was due to reduced sales in the Companys Beef segment, resulting from the effects of import and export restrictions. Additionally, sales were affected negatively by decreased sales volumes in each of the Companys protein segments, primarily due to one less week of sales in fiscal 2005. These declines were offset partially by higher average sales prices in the Companys Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments. Cost of Sales decreased $264 million or 1.1%. As a percent of sales, cost of sales increased from 92.9% to 93.4%. The decrease in cost of sales primarily was due to decreased grain costs of approximately $312 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, partially offset by higher live costs in the Pork segment, higher raw material costs in the Prepared Foods segment and higher energy costs. Additionally, the Chicken segment recorded realized and unrealized losses of $27 million in fiscal 2005 resulting from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, compared to realized and unrealized gains of $127 million in fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2004 gains in part were due to grain commodity risk management activities not designated as SFAS No. 133 hedges. Also, lower domestic cattle supplies and restrictions on imports of Canadian cattle for most of fiscal 2005 caused lower production volumes and higher operating cost per head. 30 TYSON FOODS, INC. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $48 million or 5.5%. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 3.3% to 3.6%. The increase primarily was due to an increase of approximately $28 million in corporate advertising expenses, which primarily was related to the Companys Powered by Tyson campaign. In addition, there were increases in personnel related costs and contributions and donations. Other charges include $33 million related to a legal settlement involving the Companys live swine operations and $14 million in plant closing costs, primarily related to the closings of the Companys Cleveland Street Forest, Mississippi; Portland, Maine; and Bentonville, Arkansas; operations. In July 2005, the Company announced it had agreed to settle a lawsuit resulting from the restructuring of its live swine operations. The settlement resulted in the Company recording an additional $33 million of costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. In July 2005, the Company announced its decision to make improvements to one of its Forest, Mississippi, facilities, which included more product lines, enabling the plant to increase production of processed and marinated chicken. The improvements were made at the former Choctaw Maid Farms location, which the Company acquired in fiscal 2003. The Companys Cleveland Street Forest, Mississippi, poultry operation ceased operations in March 2006. Also in July 2005, the Company announced its decision to close its Bentonville, Arkansas, facility. The production from this facility was transferred to the Companys Russellville, Arkansas, poultry plant, where an expansion enabled the facility to absorb the Bentonville facilitys production. In December 2004, the Company announced its decision to close its Portland, Maine, facility. The plant ceased operations February 4, 2005, and the production from this facility was transferred to other locations. Other charges in fiscal 2004 include $40 million in plant closing costs, primarily related to the closings of the Companys Jackson, Mississippi; Manchester, New Hampshire; Augusta, Maine; and Berlin, Maryland; operations. Also included in other charges for fiscal 2004 were $25 million in charges related to intangible asset impairments and $21 million related to fixed asset write downs. Interest expense decreased $43 million or 15.4%, primarily resulting from an 8.7% decrease in the Companys average indebtedness. In addition, the Company incurred $13 million of expenses in fiscal 2004, related to the buy back of bonds and the early redemption of Tyson de Mexico preferred shares. Excluding these charges, the overall weighted average borrowing rate decreased from 7.4% to 7.1%. Other expense decreased $17 million compared to fiscal 2004, resulting from improvements in foreign currency exchange gain/loss activity of approximately $9 million, primarily from the Companys Canadian operations, and an $8 million gain recorded in fiscal 2005 from the sale of the Companys remaining interest in Specialty Brands, Inc. The effective tax rate decreased from 36.6% in fiscal 2004 to 29.5% in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 effective rate reflects a reduction of 4.1% due to the release of income tax reserves management deemed were no longer required. The fiscal 2005 effective rate also reflects a reduction of 3.6% due to the federal income tax effect of the Medicare Part D subsidy in fiscal 2005 because this amount is not subject to federal income tax. In addition, the rate reflects an increase of 4.2% relating to the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries as allowed by the American Jobs Creation Act, offset by 2.9% relating to the reversal of certain international tax reserves no longer needed due to the effects of the repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company repatriated $404 million of foreign earnings invested outside the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act. See Note 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these issues. The estimated Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) amount reduced the fiscal 2005 effective tax rate by 2.6% compared to 0.5% in fiscal 2004. The increase in the fiscal 2005 estimated ETI benefit resulted from an increase in the estimated fiscal 2005 profit from export sales primarily due to increased profit on export sales, along with an adjustment to the estimated fiscal 2004 benefit.

The decline in sales primarily was due to lower volumes, caused largely by one less week of sales in fiscal 2005, partially offset by higher average sales prices and improved product mix. Chicken segment operating income increased $34 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 operating income includes $12 million of plant closing costs and $8 million of hurricane related losses. Fiscal 2004 operating income includes $13 million of plant closing costs and $13 million of charges related to fixed asset write downs. Fiscal 2005 operating income was affected positively by decreased grain costs of $312 million. However, the fiscal 2005 benefits from decreased grain costs were offset partially by realized and unrealized net losses of $27 million from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, compared to realized and unrealized net gains of $127 million recorded in fiscal 2004. Additionally, fiscal 2005 operating income was affected negatively by higher energy costs. Beef segment sales decreased 2.8% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The decline in sales primarily resulted from the effects of import and export restrictions. Those restrictions contributed to lower international sales volumes and lower average domestic sales prices in part due to the mix of products allowed for export. Additionally, fiscal 2005 had one less week of sales, compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 operating income decreased $139 million compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 operating income includes $10 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Fiscal 2004 operating income includes BSE related charges of $61 million and $5 million of charges related to intangible asset impairments and fixed asset write downs. The decrease in operating income primarily was due to lower domestic cattle supplies and restrictions on imports of Canadian cattle for most of fiscal 2005, which resulted in lower production volumes and raised the operating cost per head. Additionally, fiscal 2005 operating income was affected negatively by decreased volumes and margins at the Companys Lakeside operation in Canada. Also, fiscal 2005 operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $13 million from the Companys commodity risk management activities related to its fixed forward boxed beef sales and forward live cattle purchases, compared to realized and unrealized net gains of $51 million recorded in fiscal 2004. Pork segment sales increased 1.9% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in sales resulted primarily from higher average sales prices, both domestically and internationally, compared to fiscal 2004. The higher average sales prices, driven primarily by higher average live hog prices, were offset partially by a decrease in volumes, caused largely by one less week of sales. Fiscal 2005 operating income decreased $93 million compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 operating income includes costs of $33 million related to a legal settlement involving the Companys live swine operations and $2 million received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation. Fiscal 2004 operating income includes $1 million of charges related to fixed asset write downs. The decrease in operating income primarily was due to higher average live hog prices and lower volumes, which increased the operating cost per head and more than offset the increase in average sales prices. Prepared Foods segment sales decreased 3.1% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The decline in sales primarily was due to lower volumes, caused largely by one less week of sales and the rationalization of lower margin product lines, partially offset by higher average sales prices. Fiscal 2005 operating income increased $50 million compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 operating income includes $2 million of plant closing costs. Fiscal 2004 operating income includes $27 million of plant closing costs and $27 million of charges related to fixed asset write downs and intangible asset impairments. Fiscal 2005 operating income was negatively impacted by increased raw material prices. 32 TYSON FOODS, INC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In fiscal 2006, net cash of $287 million was provided by operating activities, a decrease of $712 million from fiscal 2005. The decrease primarily was due to a decline in net income of $605 million, excluding the non cash effect of deferred income taxes, and the net change in the working capital effect of $147 million. The Company used cash primarily from borrowings and operations to fund $531 million of property, plant and equipment additions, to pay dividends of $55 million on the Companys Class A and Class B stock and to repurchase $42 million of the Companys Class A stock in the open market, which purchases were made to satisfy the Companys stock compensation programs. The expenditures for property, plant and equipment were related to acquiring new equipment and upgrading facilities to maintain competitive standing and position the Company for future opportunities. The Companys foreseeable cash needs for operations growth and capital expenditures are expected to be met through cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash Provided by Operating Activities in millions 2006 2005 2004 $ 287 $ 999 $ 932 In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company issued $1.0 billion of new senior unsecured notes, which will mature on April 1, 2016 (2016 Notes). The 2016 Notes carried an initial 6.60% interest rate, with interest payments due semi annually on April 1 and October 1. In fiscal 2007, the Company used $750 million of the proceeds for the repayment of its outstanding $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The Companys short term investment at September 30, 2006, includes $750 million of proceeds from this new issuance and earnings of $20 million on the investment. On July 24, 2006, Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys) downgraded the Companys credit rating applicable to the 2016 Notes from Baa3 to Ba1. This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.60% to 6.85%, effective on the first day of the interest period during which the rating change required an adjustment to the interest rate (i.e., the issuance of the 2016 Notes). Accordingly, in the fourth quarter, the Company recorded an additional $0.7 million for the interest period from March 22, 2006, to July 1, 2006. This downgrade will increase annual interest expense and related fees by approximately $5 million, including $2.5 million related to the 2016 Notes. On July 31, 2006, Standard & Poors (S&P) also downgraded the Companys credit rating applicable to the 2016 Notes from BBB to BBB . This downgrade did not result in an increase in the interest rate on the 2016 Notes, nor did it result in an increase in interest expense or related fees for other debt. On September 18, 2006, Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (TFM), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, guaranteed the 2016 Notes. This guarantee does not extend to the other unsecured senior notes of the Company. Moodys and S&P did not change the July 2006 credit ratings applicable to the 2016 Notes. However, Moodys issued a new credit rating of Ba2, and S&P issued a new credit rating of BB+ related to the other unsecured senior notes not guaranteed by TFM. These new ratings did not impact the interest rate applicable to the 2016 Notes. However, other interest expense and related fees for other debt increased by less than $3 million. It is possible one or both of the debt rating agencies may further downgrade the Companys bond rating applicable to the 2016 Notes. S&P currently rates this long term debt BBB , with a negative outlook. Moodys currently rates this debt Ba1, with a negative outlook. The pretax impact to earnings of each further downgrade would be approximately $5 million annually, per rating agency, of which $2.5 million would be related to increased interest expense on the 2016 Notes. Total debt at September 30, 2006, was approximately $4.0 billion, an increase of $984 million from October 1, 2005. However, when adjusted for the $750 million of proceeds on deposit, debt would have been $3.2 billion, an increase of $234 million from October 1, 2005. Additionally, the Company has an unsecured revolving credit facility totaling $1.0 billion that supports the Companys short term funding needs and letters of credit. The $1.0 billion facility expires in September 2010. This agreement was amended on July 27, 2006, which reduced the availability of the unsecured revolving credit facility. See below for further description. Also, at September 30, 2006, the Company had a receivables purchase agreement with three co purchasers to sell up to $750 million of trade receivables. 33 TYSON FOODS, INC. These agreements were restructured and extended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and now consist of $375 million expiring August 2007 and $375 million expiring in August 2009. At September 30, 2006, there was $79.5 million outstanding on each of the commitments. At October 1, 2005, there were no amounts drawn under the receivables purchase agreement. Outstanding debt at September 30, 2006, consisted of $3.4 billion of debt securities, a $345 million term loan and other indebtedness of $246 million. Total Capitalization in millions 2006 2005 2004 Debt $ 3,979 $ 2,995 $ 3,362 Equity 4,440 4,671 4,292 The revolving credit facility, senior notes, notes, term loan and accounts receivable securitization contain various covenants, the more restrictive of which contain a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required interest coverage ratio. On July 27, 2006, the Company entered into a third amendment to its five year credit revolving facility and the three year term loan facility of its subsidiary, Lakeside Farms Industries, Ltd. These amendments modified the minimum required interest coverage ratio, temporarily suspended the maximum allowed leverage ratios and implemented temporary minimum consolidated EBITDA requirements. The Company was in compliance with all of such covenants at fiscal year end. In connection with these amendments, the Companys availability under its unsecured revolving credit facility decreased, and if the Companys credit rating is further downgraded, prior to the delivery of the second quarter fiscal 2007 compliance certificate, the Company is required to have certain subsidiaries guarantee the revolving credit facility and term loan. The amended agreement allows for maximum availability under the revolving credit facility of 50% of inventory, reduced by letters of credit issued and amounts outstanding under its term loan. The amount available as of September 30, 2006, was $481 million. The Companys foreseeable cash needs for operations and capital expenditures are expected to be met primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities. Additionally, at September 30, 2006, the Company had unused borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion, consisting of $481 million available under its $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and $591 million under its accounts receivable securitization. At September 30, 2006, the Company had construction projects in progress that will require approximately $182 million to complete. Capital spending for fiscal 2007 is expected to be approximately $400 million. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements material to its financial position or results of operations. The off balance sheet arrangements the Company has are guarantees of debt of outside third parties involving a lease, grower loans and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 8, Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of these guarantees. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of September 30, 2006: in millions Payments Due by Period 2012 and 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 thereafter Total Debt and capital lease obligations: Principal payments (1) $ 992 $ 454 $ 237 $ 2,296 $ 3,979 Interest payments (2) 231 464 284 617 1,596 Guarantees (3) 54 74 27 34 189 Operating lease obligations (4) 87 98 37 17 239 Purchase obligations (5) 319 11 7 2 339 Capital expenditures (6) 160 22 182 Other long term liabilities (7) 4 8 7 43 62 Total contractual commitments $ 1,847 $ 1,131 $ 599 $ 3,009 $ 6,586 34 TYSON FOODS, INC. (1) In the event of a default on payment or violation of debt covenants, acceleration of the principal payments could occur. At September 30, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. (2) Interest payments include only interest payments on fixed rate and fixed term debt, based on the expected payment dates. The Company has other interest obligations on variable rate, non term debt; however, these obligations have been excluded, as the timing of payments and expected interest rates cannot be estimated reasonably. (3) Amounts included are for the guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which involve a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments. (4) Amounts included in operating lease obligations are minimum lease payments under lease agreements. (5) Amounts included in purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount includes items such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock and natural gas contracts that provide terms that meet the above criteria. The Company has excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is not considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded. (6) Amounts included in capital expenditures are estimated amounts to complete construction projects in progress as of September 30, 2006. (7) Amounts included in other long term liabilities are items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). The pronouncement requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance based shares, in the financial statements based on the fair value at the date of the grant. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of SFAS No. 123R and unvested on the adoption date. Accordingly, no restatements were made to prior periods. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees in accounting for its employee stock compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for its stock option issuances as stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price at the date of grant. Also, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company issued restricted stock and recorded the fair value of such awards as deferred compensation amortized over the vesting period. The fair value of each option grant is established on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model for grants awarded prior to October 1, 2005, and a binomial lattice method for grants awarded subsequent to October 1, 2005. The change to the binomial lattice method was made to better reflect the exercise behavior of top management. The Company recognized compensation expense (net of tax) of $9 million and $15 million in fiscal 2006 related to stock options and restricted stock, respectively. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had $38 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years and $42 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), was issued in June 2001 and requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that resulted from the acquisition, construction, development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset. The associated asset costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future 35 TYSON FOODS, INC. event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. The Company adopted FIN 47 as of September 30, 2006. See Note 2, Change in Accounting Principle in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of the adoption of FIN 47. In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. The issues were the circumstances under which two or more inventory purchase and sales transactions with the same counterparty should be viewed as a single exchange transaction within the scope of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions and circumstances under which nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should be recognized at fair value. The Company adopted EITF Issue No. 04 13 in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of this Issue did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006; therefore, the Company expects to adopt FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact of FIN 48. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years; therefore, the Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 157 at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. This standard also requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its annual consolidated balance sheet, with limited exceptions. SFAS No. 158 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006; therefore, the Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2007. Based on the information available at September 30, 2006, the Company expects an increase in assets of $6 million, an increase in liabilities of $8 million and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income of $2 million when it adopts SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006; therefore, the Company expects to adopt SAB 108 at the end of fiscal 2007. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact of SAB 108. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the Company. 36 TYSON FOODS, INC. Financial instruments: The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, such as grains, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to various market risks. Generally, contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), as amended. If a derivative instrument is a hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will be offset either against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings as a component of cost of sales. Instruments the Company holds as part of its risk management activities that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings. The Company generally does not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 12 months. Contingent liabilities: The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, livestock procurement, securities, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Companys assumptions, the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the Companys control. Accrued self insurance: Insurance expense for health and welfare, workers compensation, auto liability and general liability risks are estimated using experience and actuarial estimates. The assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management. However, actual expenses could differ from these estimates, which could result in adjustments to amounts recorded. Pension and other postretirement benefits: The Company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits. The Company records annual amounts related to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates, mortality rates, retirement rates and healthcare cost trends. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on the current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The Company generally recognizes the effect of these modifications immediately into earnings rather than amortizing the effect over future periods. See Note 12, Pension and other postretirement benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. Impairment of long lived assets: The Company is required to assess potential impairments to its long lived assets, which are primarily property, plant and equipment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long Lived Assets, to determine if adjustments are to be recorded. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flow, assumed royalty rates and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the assessment of recoverability. The Company has elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. Other intangible asset valuations have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method based on the present value of future cash flows and for patents and in process technology using the cash flow method based on the present value of future cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods. The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if the Company experiences disruptions to the business such as end market conditions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the Company and market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. The Company recorded impairments of other intangible assets of $3 million, $4 million and $25 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 37 TYSON FOODS, INC. Marketing and advertising costs: The Company incurs advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote its products through its marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in store display incentives, coupons and other programs. The recognition of the costs related to these programs requires managements judgment in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program. These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs. Actual expenses may differ if the performance and redemption rates vary from the estimated rates. Income taxes: The Company estimates its total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the Company in various jurisdictions in which the Company earns income. Federal income taxes include an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States and be taxable, but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect the recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where the Company operates. The Company records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, the Company enters into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is a hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will be offset either against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, will be recognized immediately in earnings as a component of cost of sales. Additionally, the Company holds certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that do not meet the criteria for SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting. These positions are marked to market, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. The changes in market value of derivatives used in the Companys risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales. The changes in market value of derivatives used in the Companys risk management activities surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the Companys exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. Commodities Risk: The Company is a purchaser of certain commodities, such as grains, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations. The Company uses commodity futures to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying the Companys derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 could result in volatility in the Companys results of operations. Generally, contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of September 30, 2006, on the fair 38 TYSON FOODS, INC. value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions. The underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated. The following sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions. Effect of 10% change in fair value in millions 2006 2005 Livestock: Cattle $ 43 $ 3 Hogs 37 13 Grain 11 15 Natural Gas 1 12 Interest Rate Risk: At September 30, 2006, the Company had fixed rate, long term debt of $3.4 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%. The Company has exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixed rate, long term debt. Market risk for fixed rate, long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Companys fixed rate, long term debt by approximately $87 million at September 30, 2006, and $47 million at October 1, 2005. The fair values of the Companys long term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and or published interest rates. At September 30, 2006, the Company had variable rate, long term debt of $545 million with a weighted average interest rate (as of September 30, 2006) of 6.1%. The Company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain financial instruments. Under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings. The maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from fiscal years 2007 to 2009 with interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 5.4%. Because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements, an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on interest expense for fiscal years 2006 and 2005. Foreign Currency Risk: The Company has non cash foreign exchange gain/loss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of certain receivables and payable balances. The primary currency exchanges the Company has exposure to are the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the European euro, the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real. The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates amounts to approximately $4 million at September 30, 2006, and $5 million at October 1, 2005. Concentrations of Credit Risk: The Companys financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short term investments and trade receivables. The Companys cash equivalents and short term investments are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. At September 30, 2006, and October 1, 2005, approximately 13.0% of the Companys net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer. No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable. 39 TYSON FOODS, INC.
