ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY We are the worlds largest meat protein company and the second largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors that influence our business are customer demand for our products, the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace, accessibility of international markets, market prices for our chicken, beef and pork products, the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain and operating efficiencies of our facilities. OVERVIEW In fiscal 2007, we had significant improvements in all segments. In total, operating income improved by $691 million from last year. The following are some of the highlights for fiscal 2007: Chicken Segment Despite increased grain costs in fiscal 2007, our Chicken segment results improved largely due to increased average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes. Additionally, we sold two commodity chicken plants in May 2007 and did not rebuild another chicken plant closed due to a fire in late fiscal 2006. Beef Segment Operating cost efficiencies and yield improvements led to improved operating margins. Beef segment operating cost efficiencies benefited from closure of three beef plants, two of which were closed in fiscal 2006 and another which closed in early fiscal 2007. Pork Segment Operating cost efficiencies and yield improvements led to improved operating margins. Prepared Foods Segment Improvements in our Prepared Foods segment were primarily due to increased average sales prices. We achieved savings goal related to the Cost Management Initiative. Total debt outstanding at September 29, 2007, was reduced to $2.8 billion, which is the lowest debt level since our acquisition of IBP, inc. in 2001. in millions, except per share data 2007 2006 2005 Net income (loss) $ 268 $ (196 ) $ 372 Net earnings (loss) per diluted share 0.75 (0.58 ) 1.04 2007 Net income includes the following item: $17 million of tax expense related to a fixed asset tax cost correction, primarily related to a fixed asset system conversion in 1999. 2006 Net loss includes the following items: $63 million of costs related to beef, prepared foods and poultry plant closings; $19 million of charges related to our Cost Management Initiative and other business consolidation efforts which included severance expense, product rationalization costs and related intangible asset impairment expenses; $15 million tax expense resulting from a review of our tax account balances; and $5 million charge related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). 2005 Net income includes the following items: The effective tax rate benefited from the federal income tax effect of the Medicare Part D subsidy in fiscal 2005 of $55 million because this amount was not subject to federal income tax; $15 million non recurring income tax net benefit, which includes the reversal of tax reserves, partially offset by an income tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign income; $33 million of costs related to a legal settlement involving our live swine operations; and $14 million of costs for poultry and prepared foods plant closings. 20 TYSON FOODS, INC. OUTLOOK The following elements comprise our long term strategic plan: Create innovative and insight driven food solutions discover and sell market leading products and services to grow Tysons brand equity and help our customers succeed through our commitment to joint value creation Optimize commodity business models emphasize cost focus in operations, manage margins and maximize revenue by capitalizing on scale, yield, pricing, product mix and services Build a multi national enterprise accelerate expansion in cost competitive regions and markets with the greatest growth potential as well as increase and diversify United States exports Revolutionize conversion of raw materials and by products into high margin initiatives commercialize opportunities outside the core business, such as renewable energy and other technologically advanced platforms In fiscal 2007, we announced a strategic alliance with ConocoPhillips, which will produce and market renewable diesel fuel. The alliance plans to use our poultry, beef and pork by product fat to produce an on highway transportation fuel. Production is expected to begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We do not expect this alliance to have a significant impact to our earnings in fiscal 2008. Also in fiscal 2007, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with Syntroleum Corporation. The joint venture, Dynamic Fuels LLC, will produce renewable synthetic fuels targeting the renewable diesel, jet and military fuel markets. Construction of production facilities is expected to begin in fiscal 2008 and continue through fiscal 2009, with production targeted for 2010. We are working to potentially close two integrated poultry joint ventures in China, as well as an integrated poultry deal in Brazil. We expect to close two of these transactions by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008, with the third to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Our outlook for fiscal 2008 includes: Diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.30 to $0.70 Sales expected to be approximately $28 billion Capital spending of $425 $475 million Net interest expense of approximately $200 million Our outlook for segments in fiscal 2008 includes: Chicken We expect to participate in the increase of industry wide chicken supplies, which we think will be up 3 4% over fiscal 2007. Based on our current sales projections, we plan to increase our production volume to meet our customers needs. However, we anticipate an increase in grain costs in excess of $300 million, as compared to fiscal 2007, which we will be working to mitigate through risk management and pricing. Beef We expect to continue building on the operational execution improvements from fiscal 2007; however, the beginning of fiscal 2008 has been a very difficult and volatile environment for the industry. The current environment is the result of the industry processing too much cattle relative to supply and demand, which has a negative impact to operating margins. Historically, these conditions have had a limited duration. Pork We expect an increase in pork supplies of between 1 2%, which should lead to better results in fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Prepared Foods We expect improvements in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, as our SKU rationalization project is almost complete. Additionally, we anticipate lower pork raw material costs in fiscal 2008. 21 TYSON FOODS, INC. SUMMARY OF RESULTS Sales in millions 2007 2006 2005 Sales $ 26,900 $ 25,559 $ 26,014 Change in average sales price 6.2 % (3.9 )% Change in sales volume (0.9 )% 2.3 % Sales growth (decline) 5.2 % (1.7 )% 2007 vs. 2006 The improvement in sales was largely due to improved average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $1.5 billion in sales. The improvement is due to better market conditions in all segments, with the majority of the increase attributable to the Chicken and Beef segments. Sales were negatively impacted by a slight decrease in sales volumes, which accounted for a decrease of approximately $181 million. The decrease was driven by decreases in the Chicken and Prepared Foods segments, offset by improvements in the Beef and Pork segments. The decrease includes planned production cuts and the closure of production facilities, offset by improvements in the beef and pork export markets and improved domestic pork demand. 2006 vs. 2005 An oversupply of proteins led to decreased average sales prices in all segments. Cost of Sales in millions 2007 2006 2005 Cost of sales $ 25,467 $ 24,631 $ 24,294 Gross margin $ 1,433 $ 928 $ 1,720 Cost of sales as a percentage of sales 94.7 % 96.4 % 93.4 % 2007 vs. 2006 Decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales primarily was due to the increase in average sales prices, while average live prices and production costs did not increase at the same rate. Cost of sales increased by $836 million, with an increase in cost per pound contributing to a $982 million increase, offset by a decrease in sales volumes reducing cost of sales by $146 million. Increase in net grain costs of $256 million, which includes $334 million of increased grain costs, partially offset by increased net gains of $78 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases. Increase in average domestic live cattle and hog costs, as well as an increase in domestic pork sales volumes and our Lakeside operation sales volumes, increased cost of sales by approximately $797 million. Decrease in Chicken segment sales volumes decreased cost of sales by approximately $346 million, primarily due to planned production cuts, the sale of two poultry plants and the closure of a poultry plant in fiscal 2006 due to a fire. 2006 vs. 2005 Increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales primarily was due to the decrease in average sales prices, while average live prices and production costs did not decrease at the same rate. Increase of approximately $167 million related to energy costs. 22 TYSON FOODS, INC. Selling, General and Administrative in millions 2007 2006 2005 Selling, general and administrative $ 817 $ 935 $ 928 As a percentage of sales 3.0 % 3.7 % 3.6 % 2007 vs. 2006 Decrease of $39 million in advertising and sales promotion expenses. Decrease of $27 million due to a favorable actuarial adjustment related to retiree healthcare plan recorded in fiscal 2007 compared to an unfavorable adjustment recorded in fiscal 2006.

The decrease in sales volumes is due to planned production cuts, the sale of two poultry plants and the closure of a poultry plant in fiscal 2006 due to a fire. The increase in average sales prices contributed to improved operating income, partially offset by an increase in net grain costs of $256 million. The increase of net grain costs includes $334 million of increased grain costs, partially offset by increased net gains of $78 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases. Additionally, operating income improved due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and Operating Income The decline in sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace. In addition to the lower average sales prices, operating results were affected negatively by higher energy costs and decreased margins at our operations in Mexico. Fiscal 2006 operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $6 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $27 million recorded in fiscal 2005. 25 TYSON FOODS, INC.

Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Sales and Operating Income (Loss) The increase in sales and operating income was due to higher average sales prices, as well as higher sales volumes. The operating results improvement was due to operating cost efficiencies and yield improvements, partially offset by an increase in average live prices. Also, operating results improved significantly from a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Fiscal 2007 operating results include realized and unrealized net losses of $2 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle, excluding the related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $40 million recorded in fiscal 2006. Additionally, operating results were affected positively by significant operating margin improvements at our Lakeside operation in Canada. Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and Operating Loss The increase in sales was due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace. In addition to lower average sales prices, operating results were impacted negatively by significant operating margin reductions at our Lakeside operation in Canada. Also, fiscal 2006 operating results include realized and unrealized net losses of $40 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle, excluding the related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, compared to realized and unrealized net gains of $13 million recorded in fiscal 2005. 26 TYSON FOODS, INC.

Additionally, operating income was impacted positively by improved operating cost efficiencies and yield improvements, partially offset by higher average live prices. Fiscal 2007 operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $3 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live hogs, excluding the related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $15 million recorded in fiscal 2006. 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and Operating Income The decline in sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices, predominantly caused by an oversupply of proteins in the marketplace.

Operating income improved primarily due to an improvement in average sales prices, partially offset by an increase in plant costs and raw material costs. 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and Operating Income The decline in sales and operating income primarily was due to lower average sales prices. 27 TYSON FOODS, INC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our cash needs for operations growth and capital expenditures are expected to be met with cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as short term borrowings. Reclassification: In fiscal 2007, we reclassified $85 million and $27 million, respectively, for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, in negative book cash balances from Changes in working capital reported as Operating Activities to Increase (decrease) in negative book cash balances reported as Financing Activities to conform with the current period presentation.

Additionally, this amount represents net cash provided by operating activities prior to changes in assets and liabilities associated with operations. Over the past three years, cash provided by operating activities was approximately $2.1 billion, which enabled us to fund $1.4 billion in capital expenditures and pay down debt by $593 million. Changes in working capital: 2007 Operating cash flows declined due to higher inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by a higher accounts payable balance. 2006 Operating cash flow increased due to a lower accounts receivable balance, higher accounts payable and interest payable balances, partially offset by a lower income taxes payable/receivable balance. 2005 Operating cash flow increased due to higher accounts payable and income taxes payable/receivable balances, as well as a lower accounts receivable balance. Cash Flows from Investing Activities in millions 2007 2006 2005 Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (285 ) $ (531 ) $ (571 ) Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment 76 21 47 Proceeds from sale (purchase) of marketable securities, net 16 23 (39 ) Proceeds from sale (purchase) of short term investment 770 (750 ) Other, net 2 13 2 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities $ 579 $ (1,224 ) $ (561 ) Expenditures for property, plant and equipment include the acquisition of new equipment, upgrading our facilities to maintain competitive standing and position us for future opportunities. In fiscal 2007, we focused on reducing our capital spending. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, we had significant capital investing, including our new Discovery Center, the Sherman, Texas, case ready facility and information system technology improvements. At September 29, 2007, construction projects in progress will require approximately $194 million to complete. Capital spending for fiscal 2008 is expected to be between $425 million and $475 million. In June 2007, we, along with Syntroleum Corporation, announced the formation of Dynamic Fuels LLC, a 50/50 joint venture, which will produce renewable synthetic fuels targeting the renewable diesel, jet and military fuel markets. We anticipate total initial capital spending of approximately $75 million for the construction of the initial facility, which is 50% of the estimated cost to construct the first facility. Construction is expected to begin in fiscal 2008 and continue through fiscal 2009, with production targeted for 2010. 28 TYSON FOODS, INC. Proceeds from sale of assets in fiscal 2007 include $40 million received related to the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities. Short term investment purchased in fiscal 2006 with proceeds from $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing on April 1, 2016. The short term investment was held in an interest bearing account with a trustee. In fiscal 2007, we used proceeds from sale of the short term investment to repay our outstanding $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006. We continue to evaluate additional international and domestic growth opportunities. We are working to close potentially two integrated poultry joint ventures in China, as well as an integrated poultry deal in Brazil. We expect to close two of these transactions by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008, with the third to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.

In addition, we used cash from operations to reduce the amount outstanding under the Lakeside term loan by $320 million, repay the outstanding $125 million 7.45% Notes due June 1, 2007, and reduce other borrowings. In fiscal 2006, we repaid the $87 million 6.125% Senior Notes due February 1, 2006, and reduced other borrowings. In fiscal 2005, we repaid the $150 million 6.75% Notes due June 1, 2005, repaid the $138 million 6.625% Notes due October 17, 2005, and reduced other borrowings. Net proceeds from borrowings of debt include In fiscal 2006, we issued $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing on April 1, 2016 (2016 Notes). The 2016 Notes carried an initial 6.60% interest rate, which now carry a 6.85% interest rate, with interest payments due semi annually on April 1 and October 1. In fiscal 2007, proceeds were used to repay our outstanding $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In fiscal 2005, Lakeside Farm Industries, Ltd. (Lakeside) borrowed $353 million in U.S. dollars under an unsecured three year term loan agreement with the principal balance due at the end of the term. The agreement provides for interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus 0.4 percent to LIBOR plus one percent depending on our debt rating. Interest payments are made at least quarterly. Lakeside is one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We have $137 million of debt due in fiscal 2008. We expect to use cash from operations or short term borrowings to repay this debt. 29 TYSON FOODS, INC.

When adjusted for the $750 million short term investment held on deposit, total debt would have been $3.2 billion, with a debt to capitalization ratio of 42.1%. Credit Ratings On July 24, 2006, Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys) downgraded the credit rating applicable to the 2016 Notes from Baa3 to Ba1. This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.60% to 6.85%, effective on the first day of the interest period during which the rating change required an adjustment to the interest rate (i.e., the issuance of the 2016 Notes). This downgrade did not have a material impact to interest expense. Additionally, on July 31, 2006, Standard & Poors (S&P) downgraded the credit rating applicable to the 2016 Notes from BBB to BBB . This downgrade did not result in an increase in the interest rate on the 2016 Notes, nor did it result in an increase in interest expense or related fees for other debt. On September 18, 2006, Tyson Fresh Meats (TFM), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, guaranteed the 2016 Notes. This guarantee does not extend to the other unsecured senior notes of the Company. Moodys and S&P did not change the July 2006 credit ratings applicable to the 2016 Notes. However, Moodys issued a new credit rating of Ba2, and S&P issued a new credit rating of BB+ related to the other unsecured senior notes not guaranteed by TFM. These new ratings did not impact the interest rate applicable to the 2016 Notes and did not have a material impact on interest expense. S&P currently rates the 2016 Notes BBB , with a negative outlook. Moodys currently rates this debt Ba1, with a negative outlook. The pretax impact to earnings of a further downgrade would not be material. 30 TYSON FOODS, INC. Debt Covenants Our debt agreements contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which contain maximum allowed leverage ratios and a minimum required interest coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 29, 2007. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 8, Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of these guarantees. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 29, 2007: in millions Payments Due by Period 2013 and 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 thereafter Total Debt and capital lease obligations: Principal payments (1) $ 137 $ 382 $ 1,003 $ 1,257 $ 2,779 Interest payments (2) 200 453 221 412 1,286 Guarantees (3) 16 39 33 43 131 Operating lease obligations (4) 74 87 35 14 210 Purchase obligations (5) 636 26 6 4 672 Capital expenditures (6) 194 194 Dynamic Fuels joint venture funding 35 35 70 Other long term liabilities (7) 8 6 5 32 51 Total contractual commitments $ 1,300 $ 1,028 $ 1,303 $ 1,762 $ 5,393 (1) In the event of a default on payment or violation of debt covenants, acceleration of the principal payments could occur. At September 29, 2007, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. (2) Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at September 29, 2007, and expected payment dates. (3) Amounts included are for the guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which involve a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments. (4) Amounts included in operating lease obligations are minimum lease payments under lease agreements. (5) Amounts included in purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount includes items, such as future purchase commitments for grains and livestock contracts that provide terms that meet the above criteria. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and may not be considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded. (6) Amounts included in capital expenditures are estimated amounts to complete construction projects in progress as of September 29, 2007. (7) Amounts included in other long term liabilities are items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 31 TYSON FOODS, INC. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. We adopted SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2007. This standard also requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its annual consolidated balance sheet, with limited exceptions. This portion of the standard has a delayed effective date, which we will adopt in fiscal 2009. See Note 12, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. We adopted SAB 108 at the end of fiscal 2007, and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). The pronouncement requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance based shares, in the financial statements based on the fair value at the date of the grant. In fiscal 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of SFAS No. 123R and unvested on the adoption date. Accordingly, no restatements were made to prior periods. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees in accounting for our employee stock compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for stock option issuances as stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price at the date of grant. Also, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we issued restricted stock and recorded the fair value of such awards as deferred compensation amortized over the vesting period. The fair value of each option grant is established on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model for grants awarded prior to October 1, 2005, and a binomial lattice method for grants awarded subsequent to October 1, 2005. The change to the binomial lattice method was made to better reflect the exercise behavior of top management. We recognized compensation expense (net of tax) in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, of $11 million and $9 million related to stock options and $14 million and $15 million related to restricted stock. As of September 29, 2007, we had $44 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years and $44 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), was issued in June 2001 and requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that resulted from the acquisition, construction, development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset. The associated asset costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, which refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. We adopted FIN 47 as of September 30, 2006. See Note 2, Change in Accounting Principle in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of the adoption of FIN 47. 32 TYSON FOODS, INC. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006; therefore, we will adopt FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal 2008. Currently we are evaluating the impact the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial position and we expect the adoption of FIN 48 will result in a cumulative effect adjustment between $10 million and $25 million. The adjustment will decrease retained earnings and increase other long term liabilities. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years; therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2009. We are in process of evaluating the potential impacts of SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 159. 33 TYSON FOODS, INC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Contingent liabilities We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, livestock procurement, securities, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable. Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Marketing and advertising costs We incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in store display incentives, coupons and other programs. Marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. We accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program. Cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. The remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. Recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program. These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% change in our marketing accruals at September 29, 2007, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $9 million. 34 TYSON FOODS, INC. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Accrued self insurance We are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. We use an independent third party actuary to assist in the determination of our self insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range. Our self insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used. Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self insurance liability to change. Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self insurance liability to change. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% increase in the actuarial range at September 29, 2007, would not impact the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability. A 10% decrease in the actuarial range at September 29, 2007, would result in a gain in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately $23 million. Impairment of long lived assets Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset or a change in its physical condition. When evaluating long lived assets for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is recorded if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long lived asset. We recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets of $6 million, $67 million and $33 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2007, 2005 and 2005. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset, including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long lived assets during the last three years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long lived assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. 35 TYSON FOODS, INC. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit). For our other intangible assets, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a decline in market capitalization. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, generally our operating segments, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. Assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period. While estimating the fair value of our Beef segment, we assumed operating margins in future years in excess of the margins realized since export markets have been restricted due to BSE issues. The fair value estimate for this segment assumes future access to export markets similar to periods prior to BSE issues and it includes operating margin assumptions based on long term expectations and margins historically realized in the beef industry. We estimate the fair value of our Beef segment would be in excess of its carrying amount, including goodwill, by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 2.5%. Other intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method and using the present value of future cash flows for patents and in process technology. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years. At September 29, 2007, we had $2.5 billion of goodwill and $126 million of other intangible assets. Our goodwill is included in the following segments: $0.9 billion Chicken $1.2 billion Beef $0.3 billion Pork $0.1 billion Prepared Foods As a result of the first step of the 2007 goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, the second step was not necessary. However, a 13% decline in fair value of our Beef segment or a 7% decline in fair value of our Chicken segment would have caused the carrying values for these reporting units to be in excess of fair values which would require the second step to be performed. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and fair value of other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, we may be required to perform the second step which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill. Our fiscal 2007 other intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment. 36 TYSON FOODS, INC. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Income taxes We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Federal income taxes include an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States and be taxable, but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, we enter into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), as amended, is recognized immediately. Additionally, we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. These positions are marked to market, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. The changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales. The changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. 37 TYSON FOODS, INC. Commodities Risk: We purchase certain commodities, such as grains, livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 could result in volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006, on the fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions. The following sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions. Effect of 10% change in fair value in millions 2007 2006 Livestock: Cattle $ 33 $ 43 Hogs 64 37 Grain 9 11 Natural Gas 2 1 Interest Rate Risk: At September 29, 2007, we had fixed rate debt of $2.5 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 7.5%. We have exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixed rate debt. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $58 million at September 29, 2007, and $87 million at September 30, 2006. The fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and or published interest rates. At September 29, 2007, we had variable rate debt of $275 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates effective at September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006, would have a minimal effect on interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk: We have non cash foreign exchange gain/loss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the European euro, the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real. We periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates effective at September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006, would have a minimal effect on pretax income. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006, approximately 12.1% and 13.0%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer. No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable. 38 TYSON FOODS, INC.
