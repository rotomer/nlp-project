ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY We are the worlds largest meat company and the second largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors that influence our business are customer demand for our products, ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace, accessibility of international markets, market prices for our chicken, beef and pork products, cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain and operating efficiencies of our facilities. OVERVIEW Chicken Segment Fiscal 2008 operating results declined as compared to fiscal 2007 due largely to increased input costs of approximately $900 million, including increased grain costs, other feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients. These increases were partially offset by increased average sales prices, as well as increased net gains of $127 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, which exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions that will impact future period operating results. Beef Segment Fiscal 2008 operating results improved compared to fiscal 2007 as operating margins significantly improved in the latter half of the year, with an operating margin of 2.8% in the last six months of fiscal 2008. While sales volume was down with the closure of our Emporia, Kansas, slaughter operation, operating margins improved due to improved average sales prices and operational efficiencies. Pork Segment We achieved record operating income of $280 million, an increase of $135 million as compared to fiscal 2007, due to adequate hog supplies and strong domestic and export demand. Prepared Foods Segment Declines in operating income for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 for our Prepared Foods segment were primarily due to increased raw material costs, partially offset by increased average sales prices. Acquisitions In fiscal 2008, we announced the following transactions: In December 2007, Cobb Vantress, Inc. (Cobb), our wholly owned poultry breeding subsidiary, formed an alliance with Hendrix Genetics B.V. (Hendrix). This alliance will strengthen Cobbs position in the broiler breeding industry, Hendrix position in egg layer, turkey and swine genetics, and enable Cobb and Hendrix to explore other joint venture opportunities. In July 2008, Cobb acquired the Hybro poultry breeding and genetics business from Hendrix. The acquisition included genetic lines and facilities. At the same time, Cobb and Hendrix signed a Joint Development Agreement involving their respective Research & Development in livestock genetics. In February 2008, we signed an agreement with the Jiangsu Jinghai Poultry Industry Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese poultry breeding company, to build a fully integrated poultry operation in Haimen City near Shanghai. The joint venture, Jiangsu Tyson Foods, will produce fresh, packaged chicken products that will be sold under the Tyson name. Jiangsu Tyson will become the first producer to deliver brand name, high quality fresh chicken to consumers in the eastern China market. We own 70 percent of the business and production is expected to begin in 2009. In June 2008, we announced the acquisition of 51% ownership of Godrej Foods, Ltd., a poultry processing business in India. The joint venture is called Godrej Tyson Foods. We anticipate annual sales of approximately $50 million initially, and expect operations will expand later. Godrej Foods currently sells retail fresh and further processed chicken. In September 2008, we announced a joint venture agreement was finalized with Shandong Xinchang Group, a vertically integrated poultry operation in eastern China. Once the agreement receives the necessary government approvals, which is expected in fiscal 2009, Tyson will have a 60% ownership. The joint venture will be called Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods Company. In September 2008, we signed purchase agreements with three poultry companies in southern Brazil, each vertically integrated. These companies include Macedo Agroindustrial, Avicola Itaiopolis and Frangobras. We closed on each of these transactions subsequent to fiscal 2008. In June 2008, we executed a letter of intent to sell Lakeside Farm Industries (Lakeside), our Canadian beef operation, to XL Foods, Inc., a Canadian owned beef processing business. Under the terms of the letter of intent, Tyson will sell Lakeside for $104 million and retain the finished product inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable of Lakeside as of the closing date. XL Foods will pay an additional amount for cattle inventory, fertilizer inventory and packaging assets, estimated to approximate $82 million. The transaction remains subject to government approvals and execution of a definitive agreement by the parties. The results of Lakeside are reported as a discontinued operation. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a summary of the impact of recent deterioration of credit and capital markets on our business. 18 TYSON FOODS, INC. in millions, except per share data 2008 2007 2006 Net income (loss) $ 86 $ 268 $ (196 ) Net income (loss) per diluted share 0.24 0.75 (0.58 ) 2008 Net income includes the following items: $33 million of charges related to asset impairments, including packaging equipment, intangible assets, unimproved real property and software; $17 million charge related to restructuring our Emporia, Kansas, beef operation; $13 million charge related to closing our Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Cooked Products poultry plant; $13 million of charges related to flood damage at our Jefferson, Wisconsin, plant and severance charges related to the FAST initiative; and $18 million non operating gain related to sale of an investment. 2007 Net income includes the following item: $17 million of tax expense related to a fixed asset tax cost correction, primarily related to a fixed asset system conversion in 1999. 2006 Net loss includes the following items: $63 million of costs related to beef, prepared foods and poultry plant closings; $19 million of charges related to our Cost Management Initiative and other business consolidation efforts which included severance expense, product rationalization costs and related intangible asset impairment expenses; $15 million tax expense resulting from a review of our tax account balances; and $5 million charge related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). OUTLOOK The following elements comprise our long term strategic plan: Create innovative and insight driven food solutions: Discover and sell market leading products and services to grow Tysons brand equity and help our customers succeed through our commitment to joint value creation. Optimize commodity business models: Emphasize cost focus in operations, manage margins and maximize revenue by capitalizing on scale, yield, pricing, product mix and services. Build a multi national enterprise: Accelerate expansion in cost competitive regions and markets with the greatest growth potential as well as increase and diversify United States exports. Revolutionize conversion of raw materials and by products into high margin initiatives: Commercialize opportunities outside the core business, such as renewable energy from fat and developing other technologically advanced platforms from materials such as feathers, viscera, blood and animal waste. Our outlook for segments in fiscal 2009 includes: Chicken Export markets, credit availability and the recent strengthening dollar have negatively impacted leg quarter pricing. International leg quarter sales will be difficult at least through the beginning of fiscal 2009. We have seen grain prices drop significantly from all time highs this past summer that if sustained, will benefit us in the long run. However, we have some grain positions that could negatively impact us depending on corn and soybean meal closing prices at the end of the first quarter fiscal 2009. Beef We expect cattle supplies will be down 1 2% in fiscal 2009, but there should be ample supply to run our plants efficiently. We will continue to focus on the operational efficiencies from fiscal 2008 and expect a successful fiscal 2009. Pork While we anticipate fewer hog supplies in fiscal 2009, we expect we will have an adequate supply to achieve good operating results. This segment should continue to do well in fiscal 2009, but likely not at the record amounts we had in fiscal 2008. Prepared Foods High input costs will likely continue in fiscal 2009. Demand for our products remains strong, which should provide for sales volume growth in fiscal 2009. 19 TYSON FOODS, INC. SUMMARY OF RESULTS CONTINUING OPERATIONS Sales in millions 2008 2007 2006 Sales $ 26,862 $ 25,729 $ 24,589 Change in average sales price 5.1 % 5.8 % Change in sales volume (0.7 )% (1.1 )% Sales growth 4.4 % 4.6 % 2008 vs. 2007 The improvement in sales was largely due to improved average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $1.5 billion. While all segments had improved average sales prices, the majority of the increase was driven by increases in the Chicken and Beef segments. Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of approximately $318 million. This was primarily due to a decrease in Beef volume and the sale of two poultry production facilities in fiscal 2007, partially offset by an increase in Pork volume. 2007 vs. 2006 The improvement in sales was largely due to improved average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $1.4 billion in sales. The improvement was due to better market conditions in all segments, with the majority of the increase attributable to the Chicken and Beef segments. Sales were negatively impacted by a slight decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of approximately $226 million. The decrease was driven by decreases in the Chicken and Prepared Foods segments, offset by improvements in the Beef and Pork segments. The decrease included planned production cuts and the closure of production facilities, offset by improvements in the beef and pork export markets and improved domestic pork demand. Cost of Sales in millions 2008 2007 2006 Cost of sales $ 25,616 $ 24,300 $ 23,639 Gross margin $ 1,246 $ 1,429 $ 950 Cost of sales as a percentage of sales 95.4 % 94.4 % 96.1 % 2008 vs. 2007 Cost of sales increased $1.3 billion. Cost per pound contributed to a $1.6 billion increase, offset partially by a decrease in sales volume reducing cost of sales $323 million. Increase of over $1.0 billion in costs in the Chicken segment, which included increased input costs of approximately $900 million, including grain costs, other feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients. Plant costs, including labor and logistics, increased by approximately $200 million. These increases were partially offset by increased net gains of $127 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, which exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions that will impact future period operating results. Increase in average domestic live cattle costs of approximately $271 million. Increase in operating costs in the Beef and Pork segments of approximately $180 million. Decrease due to sales volume included lower Beef and Chicken sales volume, partially offset by higher Pork sales volume. Decrease due to net gains of $173 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle and hog purchases as compared to the same period of fiscal 2007. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which will impact future period operating results. Decrease in average live hog costs of approximately $117 million. 2007 vs. 2006 Decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales primarily was due to the increase in average sales prices, while average live prices and production costs did not increase at the same rate. Cost of sales increased by $661 million, with an increase in cost per pound contributing to an $853 million increase, offset by a decrease in sales volume reducing cost of sales by $192 million. Increase in net grain costs of $256 million, which included $334 million of increased grain costs, partially offset by increased net gains of $78 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases. Increase in average domestic live cattle and hog costs, as well as an increase in domestic pork sales volume, increased cost of sales by approximately $682 million. Decrease in Chicken segment sales volume decreased cost of sales by approximately $346 million, primarily due to planned production cuts, the sale of two poultry plants and the closure of a poultry plant in fiscal 2006 due to a fire. 20 TYSON FOODS, INC.

SEGMENT RESULTS We operate in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. The following table is a summary of sales and operating income (loss), which is how we measure segment income (loss).

As a result, our operating segments now reflect logistics operations which were previously included in Other. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. Segment results exclude the results of our discontinued operation, Lakeside. in millions Sales Operating Income (Loss) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Chicken $ 8,900 $ 8,210 $ 7,958 $ (118 ) $ 325 $ 94 Beef 11,664 11,540 10,866 106 51 (254 ) Pork 3,587 3,314 3,067 280 145 55 Prepared Foods 2,711 2,665 2,698 63 92 55 Total $ 26,862 $ 25,729 $ 24,589 $ 331 $ 613 $ (50 ) Chicken Segment Results in millions 2008 2007 Change 2008 vs. 2007 2006 Change 2007 vs. 2006 Sales $ 8,900 $ 8,210 $ 690 $ 7,958 $ 252 Sales Volume Change (0.4 )% (4.7 )% Average Sales Price Change 8.9 % 8.3 % Operating Income (Loss) $ (118 ) $ 325 $ (443 ) $ 94 $ 231 Operating Margin (1.3 )% 4.0 % 1.2 % 2008 Operating loss included $26 million of charges related to: plant closings; impairments of unimproved real property and software; and severance. 2007 Operating income included a $10 million gain on the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities. 2006 Operating income included $9 million of charges related to our Cost Management Initiative, other business consolidation efforts and plant closing costs. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and Operating Income (Loss) Sales increased as a result of an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume due to the sale of two poultry plants in fiscal 2007. Operating results were adversely impacted by increased input costs of approximately $900 million, including grain costs, other feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients.

Liquidity in millions Outstanding Letters of Commitments Facility Credit (no Amount Amount Expiration Date Amount draw downs) Borrowed Available Cash $ 250 Revolving credit facility September 2010 $ 1,000 $ 291 $ $ 709 Accounts receivable securitization facility Aug. 2009, Aug. 2010 750 750 Total liquidity $ 1,709 The revolving credit facility supports our short term funding needs and letters of credit. Letters of credit are issued primarily in support of workers compensation insurance programs and derivative activities. The accounts receivable securitization facility is with three co purchasers and allows us to sell up to $750 million of trade receivables, consisting of $375 million expiring in August 2009 and a $375 million 364 day facility with an additional one year option, which commits funding through August 2010. At September 27, 2008, we had access to the full $750 million borrowing capacity. Our borrowing capacity could be reduced in the future if our eligible receivables balance falls below $750 million. In conjunction with the $100 million of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax exempt bond issuance in October 2008, we agreed to issue a guarantee for the full amount of the bond issuance, which was issued in the form of a letter of credit, in exchange for eight million Syntroleum stock warrants valued at $0.01 each. Both the issuance of the letter of credit and the receipt of Syntroleum warrants occurred subsequent to fiscal 2008. The letter of credit will reduce the unused borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility. In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of three vertically integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil. The purchase price was $80 million, as well as up to an additional $15 million of contingent purchase price based on production volumes payable through fiscal 2010. Additionally, once the joint venture agreement with Shandong Xinchang Group receives the necessary government approvals, we expect to spend $110 $115 million to acquire a 60% ownership. We expect this to be finalized during fiscal 2009. Subject to receipt of applicable government approvals, we anticipate being ready to complete the sale of Lakeside by the end of the first quarter fiscal 2009, with plans to use available proceeds to pay down debt and other general corporate purposes. Inclusive of working capital of Lakeside initially retained by us at closing, as well as consideration received from XL Foods, we expect the following future cash flows based on the September 27, 2008, currency exchange rate: $55 million received at closing; approximately $136 million in calendar 2009; $49 million in notes receivable, plus interest, to be paid over two years by XL Foods; and $29 million of XL Foods preferred stock redeemable over five years. The discontinuance of Lakesides operation will not have a material effect on our future operating cash flows. Our current ratio at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, was 2.07 to 1 and 1.74 to 1, respectively. Deterioration of Credit and Capital Markets Credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continue into our first quarter of fiscal 2009. Several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures. While not all inclusive, the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business: Credit Facilities Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures. However, we rely on our revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit, and as a source of financing for international growth. Our revolving credit facility has total committed capacity of $1.0 billion. As of September 27, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $291 million, none of which were drawn upon, which left $709 million available for borrowing. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 35 banks, with commitments ranging from $5 million to $78 million per bank. If any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility, our liquidity could be impaired, which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs or finance our international growth strategy. Our accounts receivable securitization facility has $750 million of committed funding, of which the entire amount was available for borrowing as of September 27, 2008. Our accounts receivable securitization facility is funded by a syndicate of three banks, with a commitment of $250 million per bank. To date, all of the banks in the syndicate have continued to meet their commitments despite the recent market turmoil. If any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility, our liquidity could be impaired, which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs or finance our international growth strategy. We have borrowed against this facility subsequent to fiscal 2008 and all of the banks in the syndicate performed their obligations to fund these borrowings. 28 TYSON FOODS, INC. Current market conditions have also resulted in higher credit spreads on long term borrowings and significantly reduced demand for new corporate debt issuances. Equity Class A Common Stock Equity prices, including our own Class A Common Stock, have fallen and experienced abnormally high volatility during the current period. If these conditions persist, our cost of capital will increase significantly. Customers/Suppliers The financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions. Although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or non performance by suppliers, current market conditions increase the probability that we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults. Should current credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the United States and abroad, demand for protein products could be reduced, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows. Investments The value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets, has been negatively impacted by the recent market declines. These instruments were recorded at fair value as of September 27, 2008; however, subsequent to September 27, 2008, through November 1, 2008, we have seen an additional reduction in fair value of approximately $32 million. While we believe this reduction in fair value is temporary, if current market conditions continue, we could be required to recognize $10 million of expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The remaining change in fair value would be deferred in other comprehensive income unless determined to be permanently impaired. We currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans. All three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants. Based on our 2008 actuarial valuation, we anticipate contributions of approximately $1 million to these plans for fiscal 2009. We also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan. Based on our 2008 actuarial valuation, we anticipate contributions of approximately $1 million to this plan in fiscal 2009. Financial Instruments As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases. Similar to the capital markets, the commodities markets have seen a similar decline over the past several months. Grain prices reached an all time high during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 before falling sharply to the current levels. While the reduction in grain prices benefit us long term, we may be required to record additional losses related to these financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 if grain prices remain lower than prices at the end of fiscal 2008. Insurance We rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims, property damage and various other risks. Our primary insurers maintain an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A+ or better. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment. 29 TYSON FOODS, INC. Capitalization in millions 2008 2007 2006 Senior notes $ 2,400 $ 2,475 $ 3,388 3.25% Convertible senior notes 458 Lakeside term loan 25 345 Other indebtedness 38 279 246 Total Debt $ 2,896 $ 2,779 $ 3,979 Total Equity $ 5,014 $ 4,731 $ 4,440 Debt to Capitalization Ratio 36.6 % 37.0 % 47.3 % In fiscal 2008, we issued $458 million of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due October 15, 2013. Net proceeds were used for the net cost of the Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions, toward the repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility, and for other general corporate purposes. In fiscal 2008, we issued 22.4 million shares of Class A stock in a public offering. Net proceeds were used toward repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2006, we had $750 million in a short term investment held on deposit with a trustee. Proceeds from sale of short term investment were used to repay the $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006. This repayment was made in fiscal 2007. When adjusted for the $750 million short term investment held on deposit, total debt would have been $3.2 billion, with a debt to capitalization ratio of 42.1%. Credit Ratings 2016 Notes On July 24, 2006, Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys) downgraded the credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.60% to 6.85%, effective on the first day of the interest period during which the rating change required an adjustment to the interest rate (i.e., the issuance of the 2016 Notes). Additionally, on July 31, 2006, Standard & Poors (S&P) downgraded the credit rating from BBB to BBB . This downgrade did not change the interest rate on the 2016 Notes. On September 4, 2008, S&P downgraded the credit rating from BBB to BB. This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.85% to 7.35%, effective beginning with the six month interest payment due October 1, 2008. On November 13, 2008, Moodys downgraded the credit rating from Ba1 to Ba3. This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.35% to 7.85%, effective beginning with the six month interest payment due April 1, 2009. S&P currently rates the 2016 Notes BB. Moodys currently rates this debt Ba3. A further one notch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by an additional 0.25% per ratings agency. Revolving Credit Facility Rating After an upgrade on October 1, 2008, S&Ps credit rating for the revolving credit facility is BBB . After a downgrade on November 13, 2008, Moodys credit rating is Ba2. The pretax impact to earnings of another downgrade would not be material to annual interest expense. However, if Moodys were to downgrade this facility to Ba3 or below, or if S&P were to downgrade this facility to BB or below, then the banks participating in our accounts receivable securitization facility could refuse to purchase any additional receivables from us and the accounts receivable securitization facility could unwind with any amounts outstanding under the facility repaid as the receivables owned by Tyson Receivables Company, our wholly owned consolidated special purpose entity, are collected. Debt Covenants Our debt agreements contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which contain maximum allowed leverage ratios and a minimum required interest coverage ratio. On September 10, 2008, we amended our revolving credit facility agreement to provide a less restrictive maximum allowed leverage ratio, which takes effect in first quarter of fiscal 2009. All trademarks of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the revolving credit facility. Additionally, certain domestic subsidiaries guaranteed this facility and pledged inventory as collateral. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 27, 2008. Based on the current industry outlook and our internal forecasts, we anticipate we will be in compliance with our debt covenants throughout fiscal 2009. However, our Chicken segment in the first part of fiscal 2009 will be negatively impacted by difficult export markets and long grain positions that could negatively impact our covenant compliance. 30 TYSON FOODS, INC. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 9, Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 27, 2008: in millions Payments Due by Period 2014 and 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 thereafter Total Debt and capital lease obligations: Principal payments (1) $ 8 $ 1,245 $ 5 $ 1,638 $ 2,896 Interest payments (2) 289 339 207 329 1,164 Guarantees (3) 25 29 33 34 121 Operating lease obligations (4) 80 102 48 23 253 Purchase obligations (5) 710 73 20 24 827 Capital expenditures (6) 308 58 366 Other long term liabilities (7) 8 5 5 32 50 Total contractual commitments $ 1,428 $ 1,851 $ 318 $ 2,080 $ 5,677 (1) In the event of a default on payment or violation of debt covenants, acceleration of the principal payments could occur. At September 27, 2008, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. (2) Interest payments included interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at September 27, 2008, and expected payment dates. (3) Amounts included guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments. (4) Amounts included in operating lease obligations are minimum lease payments under lease agreements. (5) Amounts included in purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees that provide terms that meet the above criteria. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and may not be considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded. (6) Amounts included in capital expenditures are estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of September 27, 2008, as well as costs to construct Dynamics facility. (7) Amounts included in other long term liabilities are items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $220 million and related interest and penalties of $67 million at September 27, 2008, recorded as liabilities in accordance with Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). During fiscal 2009, tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately $38 million, either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance. For the remaining liability, due to the uncertainties related to these income tax matters, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts or timing of potential reductions. 31 TYSON FOODS, INC. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal 2008. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a change to the opening Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: $32 million increase to Other Current Assets, $17 million decrease to Other Current Liabilities, $106 million increase to Other Liabilities, $40 million decrease to Deferred Income Taxes and $17 million decrease to Retained Earnings. Included in these changes we recognized a $120 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a $21 million increase in the related liability for interest and penalties for a total of $141 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. We adopted SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2007 except for the requirement to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its annual consolidated balance sheet, which we adopted in fiscal 2008 and which had an immaterial impact. See Note 13, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), was issued in June 2001 and requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that resulted from the acquisition, construction, development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset. The associated asset costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, which refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. We adopted FIN 47 as of September 30, 2006. See Note 2, Change in Accounting Principle in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of the adoption of FIN 47. 32 TYSON FOODS, INC. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. Beginning September 28, 2008, we partially applied SFAS No. 157 as allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157 2, which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. As of September 28, 2008, we have applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to our financial instruments and the impact was not material. Under FSP 157 2, we will be required to apply SFAS No. 157 to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities at the beginning of fiscal 2010. We are currently reviewing the applicability of SFAS No. 157 to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities as well as the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities firm commitments, and nonfinancial warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. At September 28, 2008, we did not elect the fair value option under SFAS No. 159 and therefore there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements to establish accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity and should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements, rather than in the liability or mezzanine section between liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 160 also requires consolidated net income be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. The impact of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our current Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS No. 160 at the beginning of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination: 1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and 3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R for any business combinations entered into beginning in fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 establishes enhanced disclosure requirements about: 1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS No. 161 in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1). FSP APB 14 1 specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. The amount allocated to the equity component represents a discount to the debt, which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the debt. FSP APB 14 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted. Therefore, we expect to adopt the provisions of FSP APB 14 1 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The provisions of FSP APB 14 1 are required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Upon retrospective adoption, we anticipate our effective interest rate on our 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 will range from 8.0% to 8.50%, which would result in the recognition of an approximate $90 million to $100 million discount to these notes with the offsetting after tax amount recorded to capital in excess of par value. This discount will be accreted until the maturity date at the effective interest rate, which will not materially impact fiscal 2008 interest expense, but will result in an estimated $15 million to $20 million increase to our fiscal 2009 interest expense. 33 TYSON FOODS, INC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Contingent liabilities We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, livestock procurement, securities, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable. Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Marketing and advertising costs We incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in store display incentives, coupons and other programs. Marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. We accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program. Cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. The remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. Recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program. These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% change in our marketing accruals at September 27, 2008, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $10 million. 34 TYSON FOODS, INC. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Accrued self insurance We are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. We use an independent third party actuary to assist in determining our self insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range. Our self insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used. Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self insurance liability to change. Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self insurance liability to change. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% increase in the actuarial range at September 27, 2008, would not impact the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability. A 10% decrease in the actuarial range at September 27, 2008, would result in a gain in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately $23 million. Impairment of long lived assets Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset or a change in its physical condition. When evaluating long lived assets for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long lived asset. We recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets of $52 million, $6 million and $67 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset, including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long lived assets during the last three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long lived assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. 35 TYSON FOODS, INC. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. How ever, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit). For our other intangible assets, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assess ment date for goodwill and other intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if we experience disrup tions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, generally our operating segments, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. Assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period. While estimating the fair value of our Beef and Chicken reporting units, we assumed operating margins in future years in excess of the margins realized in the most current year. The fair value estimates for these reporting units assume normalized operating margin assumptions and improved operating efficiencies based on long term expectations and margins historically realized in the beef and chicken industries. We estimate the fair value of our Beef reporting unit would be in excess of its carrying amount, including goodwill, by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 2.3%. We estimate the fair value of our Chicken reporting units would be in excess of its carrying amount, including goodwill, by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 5.1%. Other intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method and using the present value of future cash flows for patents and in process technology. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years. As a result of the first step of the 2008 goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, the second step was not necessary. However, a 6% decline in fair value of our Beef reporting unit or an 11% decline in fair value of our Chicken reporting unit would have caus ed the carrying values for these reporting units to be in excess of fair values which would require the second step to be per formed. The second step could have re sulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. While we believe we have made reason able estimates and assumptions to calc ulate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our est imates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill. During the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continuing into November 2008, our market capital ization was below book value. While we considered the market capitalization de cline in our evaluation of fair value of goodwill, we determined it did not impact the overall goodwill impairment analysis as we believe the decline to be primarily attributed to the negative market condi tions as a result of the credit crisis, ind ications of a possible recession and current issues within the poultry industry. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and poultry industry events. Our fiscal 2008 other intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge. A hypo thetical 10% decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment. 36 TYSON FOODS, INC. Effect if Actual Results Differ Description Judgments and Uncertainties From Assumptions Income taxes We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Federal income taxes include an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States and be taxable, but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. This analysis is performed in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48, which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contain uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds of FIN 48. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which FIN 48 liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded FIN 48 liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, we enter into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), as amended, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value, as defined by SFAS No. 133, is recognized immediately. Additionally, we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. These positions are marked to market, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales. The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. Commodities Risk: We purchase certain commodities, such as grains and livestock, in the course of normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying our derivative 37 TYSON FOODS, INC. financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 could result in volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, on the fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge derivative financial instruments. Effect of 10% change in fair value in millions 2008 2007 Livestock: Cattle $ 78 $ 33 Hogs 31 64 Grain 88 9 Interest Rate Risk: At September 27, 2008, we had fixed rate debt of $2.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 7.0%. We have exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixed rate debt. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $45 million at September 27, 2008, and $58 million at September 29, 2007. The fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and or published interest rates. At September 27, 2008, we had variable rate debt of $19 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates effective at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, would have a minimal effect on interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk: We have foreign exchange gain/loss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the European euro, the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real. We periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates effective at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, related to the foreign exchange forward contracts would have an $11 million and $3 million, respectively, impact on pretax income. In the future, we may enter into more foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of our international growth strategy. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, 12.2% and 12.1%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Wal Mart Stores, Inc. No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable. 38 TYSON FOODS, INC.
