ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY We are the worlds largest meat protein company and the second largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain; and operating efficiencies of our facilities. OVERVIEW Chicken Segment Fiscal 2009 operating results were negatively impacted in the first half of fiscal 2009 by high grain costs and net losses on our commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy purchases. The second half of fiscal 2009 benefited as we had worked through the majority of our long grain positions, had more stable grain prices and made several operational improvements. Operating margins in the first half of fiscal 2009 were negative 7.2%, while the second half improved to positive 3.5%. Beef Segment Fiscal 2009 operating loss was $346 million, which included a $560 million non cash goodwill impairment. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, operating results doubled as compared to fiscal 2008. We sustained our operational improvements made in fiscal 2008 and continue to have strong performance, which shows in our fiscal 2009 operating results. Beef Goodwill Impairment We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires us to make various judgmental estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount factors. The recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions led to an increase in our discount rate. The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 10.1% in fiscal 2009 from 9.3% in fiscal 2008. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions. The increased discount rate resulted in the non cash partial impairment of our beef reporting units goodwill. The impairment has no impact on managements estimates of the Beef segments long term profitability or value. Pork Segment While our operating income was down as compared to the record year we had in fiscal 2008, we still had solid operating earnings of $160 million, or 4.7%, with strong demand for our products and adequate supplies of hogs. Prepared Foods Segment In fiscal 2009, we had improvements in our sales volumes, which led to operating margins of 4.7%. In addition, we made several operational improvements that allow us to run our plants more efficiently. Liquidity In March 2009, we replaced our then existing $1.0 billion revolving credit facility set to expire in fiscal 2010 with a new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in March 2012. In addition, we issued $810 million of senior notes. In conjunction with these transactions, we paid down and terminated our accounts receivable securitization agreement. These transactions, as well as a significant decrease in our working capital needs, helped to strengthen our liquidity position. At October 3, 2009, we had nearly $1.2 billion in total cash (including restricted cash), as well as $733 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Acquisitions In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of three vertically integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil. In August 2009, we acquired 60% equity interest in a joint venture with a vertically integrated poultry operation in eastern China. In March 2009, we completed the sale of the beef processing, cattle feed yard and fertilizer assets of three of our Alberta, Canada subsidiaries (collectively, Lakeside) to XL Foods Inc., a Canadian owned beef processing business, and an entity affiliated with XL Foods. We received total consideration of $145 million, which included cash received at closing, collateralized notes receivable and XL Foods Preferred Stock. Our accounting cycle resulted in a 53 week year for fiscal 2009 and a 52 week year for both fiscal 2008 and 2007. in millions, except per share data 2009 2008 2007 Net income (loss) $ (537 ) $ 86 $ 268 Net income (loss) per diluted share (1.44 ) 0.24 0.75 2009 Net loss includes the following items: $560 million non cash, non tax deductible charge related to a goodwill impairment in our Beef segment; and $15 million charge related to the closing of our Ponca City, Oklahoma, processed meats plant. 2008 Net income includes the following items: $33 million of charges related to asset impairments, including packaging equipment, intangible assets, unimproved real property and software; $17 million charge related to restructuring our Emporia, Kansas, beef operation; $13 million charge related to closing our Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Cooked Products poultry plant; $13 million of charges related to flood damage at our Jefferson, Wisconsin, plant and severance charges related to the FAST initiative; and $18 million non operating gain related to sale of an investment. 2007 Net income includes the following item: $17 million of tax expense related to a fixed asset tax cost correction, primarily related to a fixed asset system conversion in 1999. FISCAL 2010 OUTLOOK Segments: Chicken At the end of fiscal 2009, industry pullet placements were down 5 6% as a result of weaker demand. However, we expect demand will improve as we get further into fiscal 2010, and we expect the pricing environment to improve aided by cold storage inventories which are down relative to the levels we have seen over the last several years. We also currently expect to see grain costs down as compared to fiscal 2009. Additionally, we will continue to focus on making operational improvements to help maximize our margins. Beef While we expect a reduction in cattle supplies of 1 2% in fiscal 2010, we do not expect a significant change in the fundamentals of our Beef business as it relates to fiscal 2009. We expect adequate supplies to operate our plants. We will manage our spreads by maximizing our revenues through product mix, minimizing our operating costs, while keeping our focus on quality and customer service. Pork We expect to see a gradual decline in hog supplies through the first half of fiscal 2010, which will accelerate into the second half of fiscal 2010, resulting in industry slaughter slightly higher than 2007 (or roughly 4% less than fiscal 2009). However, we still believe we will have adequate supplies in the regions in which we operate. We will manage our spreads by continuing to control our costs and maximizing our revenues. Prepared Foods Raw material costs will likely increase in fiscal 2010, but we have made some changes in our sales contracts that move us further away from fixed price contracts toward formula pricing, which will better enable us to absorb rising raw material costs. With the changes we have made with our sales contracts and the operational efficiencies we made during fiscal 2009, we expect strong results in fiscal 2010. SUMMARY OF RESULTS CONTINUING OPERATIONS Sales in millions 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 26,704 $ 26,862 $ 25,729 Change in sales volume 4.4 % (0.7 )% Change in average sales price (4.8 )% 5.1 % Sales growth (decline) (0.6 )% 4.4 % 2009 vs. 2008 Average Sales Price The decline in sales was largely due to a reduction in average sales prices, which accounted for a decrease of approximately $1.2 billion. While all segments had a reduction in average sales prices, the majority of the decrease was driven by the Beef and Pork segments. Sales Volume Sales were positively impacted by an increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of approximately $1.0 billion. This was primarily due to an extra week in fiscal 2009, increased sales volume in our Chicken segment, which was driven by inventory reductions, and sales volume related to recent acquisitions. 2008 vs. 2007 Average Sales Price The improvement in sales was largely due to improved average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $1.5 billion. While all segments had improved average sales prices, the majority of the increase was driven by the Chicken and Beef segments. Sales Volume Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of approximately $318 million. This was primarily due to a decrease in Beef volume and the sale of two poultry production facilities in fiscal 2007, partially offset by an increase in Pork volume. Cost of Sales in millions 2009 2008 2007 Cost of sales $ 25,501 $ 25,616 $ 24,300 Gross margin $ 1,203 $ 1,246 $ 1,429 Cost of sales as a percentage of sales 95.5 % 95.4 % 94.4 % 2009 vs. 2008 Cost of sales decreased $115 million. Cost per pound contributed to a $1.1 billion decrease, offset partially by an increase in sales volume increasing cost of sales $987 million. Increase due to net losses of $257 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to net gains of $206 million in fiscal 2008, from our commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy purchases, which exclude the effect from related physical purchase transactions which impact current and future period operating results. Increase due to sales volumes, which included an extra week in fiscal 2009, as well as increased sales volume in our Chicken segment, which was driven by inventory reductions and sales volume related to recent acquisitions. Decrease in average domestic live cattle and hog costs of approximately $1.2 billion. 2008 vs. 2007 Cost of sales increased $1.3 billion. Cost per pound contributed to a $1.6 billion increase, offset partially by a decrease in sales volume reducing cost of sales $323 million. Increase of over $1.0 billion in costs in the Chicken segment, which included increased input costs of approximately $900 million, including grain costs, other feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients. Plant costs, including labor and logistics, increased by approximately $200 million. These increases were partially offset by increased net gains of $127 million from our commodity risk management activities related to grain purchases, which exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions which impact current and future period operating results. Increase in average domestic live cattle costs of approximately $271 million. Increase in operating costs in the Beef and Pork segments of approximately $180 million. Decrease due to sales volume included lower Beef and Chicken sales volume, partially offset by higher Pork sales volume. Decrease due to net gains of $173 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle and hog purchases as compared to the same period of fiscal 2007. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which impact future period operating results. Decrease in average live hog costs of approximately $117 million. Selling, General and Administrative in millions 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general and administrative $ 841 $ 879 $ 814 As a percentage of sales 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.2 % 2009 vs. 2008 Decrease of $33 million related to advertising and sales promotions. Decrease of $11 million related to the change in investment returns on company owned life insurance, which is used to fund non qualified retirement plans. Other reductions include decreases in our payroll related expenses and professional fees. Increase of $20 million due to our newly acquired foreign operations. 2008 vs. 2007 Increase of $29 million related to unfavorable investment returns on company owned life insurance, which is used to fund non qualified retirement plans. Increase of $16 million related to advertising and sales promotions. Increase of $14 million due to a favorable actuarial adjustment related to retiree healthcare plan recorded in fiscal 2007. Increase of $9 million due to a gain recorded in fiscal 2007 on the disposition of an aircraft. Goodwill Impairment in millions 2009 2008 2007 $ 560 $ $ 2009 We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires us to make various judgmental estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount factors. The recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions led to an increase in our discount rate. The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 10.1% in fiscal 2009 from 9.3% in fiscal 2008. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions. The increased discount rate resulted in the non cash partial impairment of our beef reporting units goodwill. The impairment has no impact on managements estimates of the Beef segments long term profitability or value. Other Charges in millions 2009 2008 2007 $ 17 $ 36 $ 2 2009 Included $15 million charge related to closing our Ponca City, Oklahoma, processed meats plant. 2008 Included $17 million charge related to restructuring our Emporia, Kansas, beef operation. Included $13 million charge related to closing our Wilkesboro, North Carolina, Cooked Products poultry plant. Included $6 million of severance charges related to the FAST initiative. Interest Income in millions 2009 2008 2007 $ 17 $ 9 $ 8 2009 The increase is due to the increase in our cash balance. Interest Expense in millions 2009 2008 2007 Cash interest expense $ 273 $ 214 $ 229 Non cash interest expense 37 1 3 Total Interest Expense $ 310 $ 215 $ 232 2009 vs. 2008 Cash interest expense includes interest expense related to the coupon rates for senior notes, commitment/letter of credit fees incurred on our revolving credit facilities, as well as other miscellaneous recurring cash payments. The increase was due primarily to higher average weekly indebtedness of approximately 13%. We also had an increase in the overall average borrowing rates. Non cash interest expense primarily includes interest related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts/premiums on note issuances. The increase was primarily due to debt issuance costs incurred on the new credit facility in fiscal 2009, the 10.5% Notes due March 2014 (2014 Notes) issued in fiscal 2009 and amendment fees paid in December 2008 on our then existing credit agreements. In addition, we had an increase due to the accretion of the debt discount on the 2014 Notes. Non cash interest expense also includes an unrealized loss on our interest rate swap and the gain/loss on bond buybacks. 2008 vs. 2007 The reduction in cash interest expense was due to a lower average borrowing rate, as well as lower average weekly indebtedness of approximately 2%. Other (Income) Expense, net in millions 2009 2008 2007 $ 18 $ (29 ) $ (21 ) 2009 Included $24 million in foreign currency exchange loss. 2008 Included $18 million non operating gain related to the sale of an investment. 2007 Included $14 million in foreign currency exchange gain. Effective Tax Rate 2009 2008 2007 (2.7 )% 44.6 % 34.6 % 2009 Reduced the effective tax rate 37.2% due to impairment of goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. Reduced the effective tax rate 3.9% due to increase in foreign valuation allowances. Increased the effective tax rate 2.3% due to general business credits. Increased the effective tax rate 1.8% due to tax planning in foreign jurisdictions. 2008 Increased the effective tax rate 5.0% due to increase in state valuation allowances. Increased the effective tax rate 4.4% due to increase in unrecognized tax benefits. Increased the effective tax rate 3.8% due to net negative returns on company owned life insurance policies, which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Reduced the effective tax rate 3.8% due to general business credits. 2007 Increased the effective tax rate 4.2% due to a fixed asset tax cost correction, primarily related to a fixed asset system conversion in 1999. Increased the effective tax rate 3.2% due to the federal income tax effect of the reductions in estimated Medicare Part D subsidy in fiscal 2007, which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Reduced the effective tax rate 4.6% due to the reduction of income tax reserves based on favorable settlement of disputed matters. SEGMENT RESULTS We operate in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods.

Segment results exclude the results of our discontinued operation, Lakeside. in millions Sales Operating Income (Loss) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Chicken $ 9,660 $ 8,900 $ 8,210 $ (157 ) $ (118 ) $ 325 Beef 10,782 11,664 11,540 (346 ) 106 51 Pork 3,426 3,587 3,314 160 280 145 Prepared Foods 2,836 2,711 2,665 133 63 92 Other (5 ) Total $ 26,704 $ 26,862 $ 25,729 $ (215 ) $ 331 $ 613 Chicken Segment Results in millions 2009 2008 Change 2009 vs. 2008 2007 Change 2008 vs. 2007 Sales $ 9,660 $ 8,900 $ 760 $ 8,210 $ 690 Sales Volume Change 8.8 % (0.4 )% Average Sales Price Change (0.2 )% 8.9 % Operating Income (Loss) $ (157 ) $ (118 ) $ (39 ) $ 325 $ (443 ) Operating Margin (1.6 )% (1.3 )% 4.0 % 2008 Operating loss included $26 million of charges related to: plant closings; impairments of unimproved real property and software; and severance. 2007 Operating income included a $10 million gain on the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales Volume The increase in sales volume for fiscal 2009 was due to the extra week in fiscal 2009, as well as inventory reductions and sales volume related to recent acquisitions. Average Sales Price The inventory reductions and recent acquisitions lowered the average sales price, as most of the inventory reduction related to commodity products shipped internationally and sales volume from recent acquisitions was on lower priced products. Operating Loss Operational Improvements Operating results were positively impacted by operational improvements, which included: yield, mix and live production performance improvements; additional processing flexibility; and reduced interplant product movement. Derivative Activities Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy purchases. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results. 2009 Loss $(257) million 2008 Income 206 million Decline in operating results $(463) million SG&A Expenses We reduced our selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 by approximately $37 million. Grain Costs Operating results were positively impacted in fiscal 2009 by a decrease in grain costs of $28 million. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and Operating Income (Loss) Sales increased as a result of an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume due to the sale of two poultry plants in fiscal 2007. Operating results were adversely impacted by increased input costs of approximately $900 million, including grain costs, other feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients. Plant costs, including labor and logistics, increased by approximately $200 million. This was partially offset by increased net gains of $127 million from our commodity trading risk management activities related to grain purchases, which exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions which impact current and future period operating results. Operating results were also negatively impacted by increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $43 million. Beef Segment Results in millions 2009 2008 Change 2009 vs. 2008 2007 Change 2008 vs. 2007 Sales $ 10,782 $ 11,664 $ (882 ) $ 11,540 $ 124 Sales Volume Change 0.5 % (4.6 )% Average Sales Price Change (8.0 )% 5.9 % Operating Income (Loss) $ (346 ) $ 106 $ (452 ) $ 51 $ 55 Operating Margin (3.2 )% 0.9 % 0.4 % 2009 Operating loss included a $560 million non cash charge related to the partial impairment of goodwill. 2008 Operating income included $35 million of charges related to: plant restructuring, impairments of packaging equipment and intangible assets, and severance. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales and Operating Income (Loss) While our average sales prices have decreased as compared to fiscal 2008, we have still maintained a margin as the average live costs decreased in line with the drop in our average sales price. Derivative Activities Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results. 2009 Income $102 million 2008 Income 53 million Improvement in operating results $49 million 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and Operating Income Sales and operating income were impacted positively by higher average sales prices and improved operational efficiencies, partially offset by decreased sales volume due primarily to closure of the Emporia, Kansas, slaughter operation. Operating results were also negatively impacted by higher operating costs. Fiscal 2008 operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $53 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle, excluding the related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $2 million recorded in fiscal 2007. Operating results were positively impacted by an increase in average sales prices exceeding the increase in average live prices. Pork Segment Results in millions 2009 2008 Change 2009 vs. 2008 2007 Change 2008 vs. 2007 Sales $ 3,426 $ 3,587 $ (161 ) $ 3,314 $ 273 Sales Volume Change 1.7 % 6.1 % Average Sales Price Change (6.1 )% 2.1 % Operating Income $ 160 $ 280 $ (120 ) $ 145 $ 135 Operating Margin 4.7 % 7.8 % 4.4 % 2008 Operating income included $5 million of charges related to impairment of packaging equipment and severance. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales and Operating Income Operating results for fiscal 2009 were strong, but down when compared to the record year we had in fiscal 2008. While sales volume was relatively flat versus fiscal 2008, results were negatively impacted by a decrease in our average sales prices, which were only partially offset by the decrease in average live costs. Derivative Activities Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live hogs. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which impact current and future period operating results. 2009 Income $55 million 2008 Income 95 million Decline in operating results ($40) million 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and Operating Income Operating results were impacted positively by lower average live prices and strong export sales, which led to increased sales volume and a record year for operating margins. Fiscal 2008 operating results include realized and unrealized net gains of $95 million from our commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live hogs, excluding the related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, compared to realized and unrealized net gains of $3 million recorded in fiscal 2007. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, as well as lower average sales prices. Prepared Foods Segment Results in millions 2009 2008 Change 2009 vs. 2008 2007 Change 2008 vs. 2007 Sales $ 2,836 $ 2,711 $ 125 $ 2,665 $ 46 Sales Volume Change 5.2 % 1.5 % Average Sales Price Change (0.6 )% 0.2 % Operating Income $ 133 $ 63 $ 70 $ 92 $ (29 ) Operating Margin 4.7 % 2.3 % 3.5 % 2009 Operating income included a $15 million charge related to closing our Ponca City, Oklahoma, processed meats plant. 2008 Operating income included $10 million of charges related to flood damage, an intangible asset impairment and severance. 2007 Operating income included $7 million of charges related to intangible asset impairments. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales and Operating Income Operating results improved due to an increase in sales volume, as well as a reduction in raw material costs that exceeded the decrease in our average sales prices. In addition, we made several operational improvements in fiscal 2009 that allow us to run our plants more efficiently. We began realizing the majority of these improvements in our operating results during the latter part of fiscal 2009. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and Operating Income Operating results were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs, which include wheat, dairy and cooking ingredient costs, partially offset by lower pork costs. Results were positively impacted by an increase in average sales prices. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and growth opportunities are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided by operating activities, or short term borrowings. Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances, our then current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. Cash Flows from Operating Activities in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net income (loss) $ (537 ) $ 86 $ 268 Non cash items in net income (loss): Depreciation and amortization 496 493 514 Deferred taxes (26 ) 35 5 Impairment of goodwill 560 Impairment and write down of assets 32 57 14 Other, net 68 26 (15 ) Changes in working capital 432 (409 ) (108 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,025 $ 288 $ 678 Changes in working capital: 2009 Increased primarily due to a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable. The lower inventory balance was primarily due to the reduction of inventory volumes, as well as a decrease in raw material costs. 2008 Decreased primarily due to higher inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by a higher accounts payable balance. Higher inventory balances were driven by an increase in raw material costs and inventory volume. 2007 Decreased primarily due to higher inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by a higher accounts payable balance.

In fiscal 2008, our capital spending included equipment updates in our chicken plants, as well as packaging equipment upgrades in our Fresh Meats case ready facilities. In fiscal 2007, we focused on reducing our capital spending. Capital spending for fiscal 2010 is expected to be approximately $600 million, and includes: approximately $400 million on current core business capital spending; approximately $150 million on foreign operations, which includes post acquisition capital spending related to our Brazil and China acquisitions; and approximately $50 million related to Dynamic Fuels, most of which relates to the completion of Dynamic Fuels first facility. Construction of the first facility is expected to continue through early 2010, with production targeted soon thereafter. At October 3, 2009, we had $43 million in restricted cash available for spending on this facility. Acquisitions In October 2008, we acquired three vertically integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil. The aggregate purchase price was $67 million, of which $4 million of mandatory deferred payments remains to be paid through fiscal 2011. In addition, we have $15 million of contingent purchase price based on production volumes anticipated to be paid through fiscal 2011. The joint ventures in China called Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods received the necessary government approvals during fiscal 2009. The aggregate purchase price for our 60% equity interest was $21 million, which excludes $93 million of cash transferred to the joint venture for future capital needs. Proceeds from sale of assets in fiscal 2007 include $40 million received related to the sale of two poultry plants and related support facilities. Short term investment was purchased in fiscal 2006 with proceeds from $1.0 billion of senior notes maturing on April 1, 2016 (2016 Notes). The short term investment was held in an interest bearing account with a trustee. In fiscal 2007, we used proceeds from sale of the short term investment to repay our outstanding $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006. Change in restricted cash In October 2008, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax exempt bonds made available by the federal government to the regions affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The cash received from these bonds is restricted and can only be used towards the construction of the Dynamic Fuels facility. Cash Flows from Financing Activities in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net borrowings (payments) on revolving credit facilities $ 15 $ (213 ) $ 53 Payments on debt (380 ) (147 ) (1,263 ) Net proceeds from borrowings 852 449 Net proceeds from Class A stock offering 274 Convertible note hedge transactions (94 ) Warrant transactions 44 Purchases of treasury shares (19 ) (30 ) (61 ) Dividends (60 ) (56 ) (56 ) Stock options exercised 1 9 74 Change in negative book cash balances (65 ) 67 9 Change in restricted cash to be used for financing activities (140 ) Debt issuance costs (59 ) Other, net 5 18 (8 ) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 150 $ 321 $ (1,252 ) Net borrowings (payments) on revolving credit facilities primarily include activity related to the accounts receivable securitization facility. With the entry into the new revolving credit facility and issuance of the 2014 Notes in March 2009, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and terminated the facility. Payments on debt include In fiscal 2009, we bought back $293 million of notes, which included: $161 million 8.25% Notes due October 2011 (2011 Notes); $94 million 7.95% Notes due February 2010 (2010 Notes); and $38 million 2016 Notes. In fiscal 2008, we bought back $40 million 2016 Notes and repaid the remaining $25 million outstanding Lakeside term loan. In fiscal 2007, we used proceeds from sale of the short term investment to repay our outstanding $750 million 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006. In addition, we used cash from operations to reduce the amount outstanding under the Lakeside term loan by $320 million, repay the outstanding $125 million 7.45% Notes due June 1, 2007, and reduce other borrowings. Net proceeds from borrowings include In fiscal 2009, we issued $810 million of 2014 Notes. After the original issue discount of $59 million, based on an issue price of 92.756% of face value, we received net proceeds of $751 million. We used the net proceeds towards the repayment of our borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes. In fiscal 2009, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax exempt bonds made available by the Federal government to the regions affected by Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005. These floating rate bonds are due October 1, 2033. In fiscal 2008, we issued $458 million 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due October 15, 2013. Net proceeds were used for the net cost of the related Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions, toward the repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility, and for other general corporate purposes. In fiscal 2008, we issued 22.4 million shares of Class A stock in a public offering. Net proceeds were used toward repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes. In conjunction with the entry into our new credit facility and the issuance of the 2014 Notes during fiscal 2009, we paid $48 million for debt issuance costs. We have $140 million of 2010 Notes outstanding. We originally placed $234 million of the net proceeds from the 2014 Notes in a blocked cash collateral account to be used for the payment, prepayment, repurchase or defeasance of the 2010 Notes. At October 3, 2009, we had $140 million remaining in the blocked cash collateral account. At October 3, 2009, we had $839 million outstanding 2011 Notes. We plan presently to use current cash on hand and cash flows from operations for payment on the 2011 Notes. Liquidity in millions Commitments Expiration Date Facility Amount Outstanding Letters of Credit under Revolving Credit Facility (no draw downs) Amount Borrowed Amount Available Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,004 Revolving credit facility March 2012 $ 1,000 $ 267 $ $ 733 Total liquidity $ 1,737 The revolving credit facility supports our short term funding needs and letters of credit. Letters of credit are issued primarily in support of workers compensation insurance programs, derivative activities and Dynamic Fuels Gulf Opportunity Zone tax exempt bonds. We completed the sale of Lakeside in March 2009. Inclusive of the working capital of Lakeside initially retained by us at closing, as well as consideration received from XL Foods, we expect the following future cash flows based on the October 3, 2009, currency exchange rate: approximately $10 million in fiscal 2010; $45 million in notes receivable, plus interest, to be paid by March 2011 by XL Foods; and $24 million of XL Foods preferred stock redeemable through March 2014. The discontinuance of Lakesides operation will not have a material effect on our future operating cash flows. Our current ratio at October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, was 2.20 to 1 and 2.07 to 1, respectively. Deterioration of Credit and Capital Markets Credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and continued into fiscal 2009. Several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures. While not all inclusive, the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business: Credit Facility Cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $1.0 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit, and as a source of financing for growth opportunities. As of October 3, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit agreement totaling $267 million, none of which were drawn upon, which left $733 million available for borrowing. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 19 banks, with commitments ranging from $6 million to $115 million per bank. If any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility, our liquidity could be impaired, which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs, support letters of credit or finance our growth opportunities. Customers/Suppliers The financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions. Although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or non performance by suppliers, current market conditions increase the probability we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults. Should current credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the United States and abroad, demand for protein products could be reduced, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows. In addition, we rely on livestock producers throughout the country to supply our live cattle and hogs. If these producers are adversely impacted by the current economic conditions and go out of business, our livestock supply for processing could be significantly impacted. Additionally, we have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate. Under these programs, we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices. The amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest. Participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost, or upon termination of the agreement. Our maximum obligation associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock suppliers net tangible assets. Although we believe the aggregate maximum obligation under the program is unlikely to ever be reached, the potential maximum obligation as of October 3, 2009, is approximately $250 million. The total receivables under these programs were $72 million and $7 million at October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers, we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers assets. After analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions, we have recorded an allowance for these programs estimated uncollectible receivables of $20 million and $2 million at October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, respectively. Investments The value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets, has been impacted by the market volatility over the past year. These instruments were recorded at fair value as of October 3, 2009. During fiscal 2009, we had a reduction in fair value resulting in the recognition through earnings of $11 million. We currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans. All three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants. Based on our 2009 actuarial valuation, we anticipate contributions of $2 million to these plans for fiscal 2010. We also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan. Based on our 2009 actuarial valuation, we anticipate contributions of $2 million to this plan for fiscal 2010. Financial Instruments As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases. Similar to the capital markets, the commodities markets have been volatile over the past year. Grain and some energy prices reached an all time high during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 before falling sharply. While the reduction in grain and energy prices benefit us long term, we recorded losses related to these financial instruments in fiscal 2009 of $257 million. We have recently implemented policies to reduce our earnings volatility associated with mark to market derivative activities, including more use of normal physical purchases and normal physical sales which are not required to be marked to market. Insurance We rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims, property damage and various other risks. Our primary insurers maintain an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A or better. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment. Capitalization in millions 2009 2008 Senior notes $ 3,323 $ 2,858 GO Zone tax exempt bonds 100 Other indebtedness 129 38 Total Debt $ 3,552 $ 2,896 Total Equity $ 4,352 $ 5,014 Debt to Capitalization Ratio 44.9 % 36.6 % In fiscal 2009, we issued $810 million of 2014 Notes. The 2014 Notes had an original issue discount of $59 million, based on an issue price of 92.756% of face value. We used the net proceeds towards the repayment of our borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax exempt bonds made available by the Federal government to the regions affected by Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005. These floating rate bonds are due October 1, 2033. In fiscal 2009, we bought back $293 million of notes, which included: $161 million 2011 Notes; $94 million 2010 Notes; and $38 million 2016 Notes. At October 3, 2009, we had a total of approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Credit Ratings 2016 Notes On September 4, 2008, Standard & Poors (S&P) downgraded the credit rating from BBB to BB. This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.85% to 7.35%, effective beginning with the six month interest payment due October 1, 2008. On November 13, 2008, Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys) downgraded the credit rating from Ba1 to Ba3. This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 7.35% to 7.85%, effective beginning with the six month interest payment due April 1, 2009. S&P currently rates the 2016 Notes BB. Moodys currently rates this debt Ba3. A further one notch downgrade by either ratings agency would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by an additional 0.25%. Revolving Credit Facility S&Ps corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is BB. Moodys corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is Ba3. If S&P were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to B+ or lower or Moodys were to downgrade our corporate credit rating to B1 or lower, our letter of credit fees would increase by an additional 0.25%. Debt Covenants Our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; pay dividends or make other payments in respect to our capital stock; amend material documents; change the nature of our business; make certain payments of debt; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale/leaseback or hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. If availability under this facility is less than the greater of 15% of the commitments and $150 million, we will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our 2014 Notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; make certain investments and restricted payments; create liens; create restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries; engage in specified sales of assets and subsidiary stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter new lines of business; engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions; and engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 10, Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 3, 2009: in millions Payments Due by Period 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 and thereafter Total Debt and capital lease obligations: Principal payments (1) $ 219 $ 866 $ 1,280 $ 1,241 $ 3,606 Interest payments (2) 289 444 327 220 1,280 Guarantees (3) 22 33 43 16 114 Operating lease obligations (4) 79 120 55 22 276 Purchase obligations (5) 423 55 19 22 519 Capital expenditures (6) 267 11 278 Other long term liabilities (7) 13 5 5 36 59 Total contractual commitments $ 1,312 $ 1,534 $ 1,729 $ 1,557 $ 6,132 (1) In the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur. (2) Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at October 3, 2009, and expected payment dates. (3) Amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments. (4) Amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements. (5) Amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees that provide terms that meet the above criteria. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and may not be considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded. (6) Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of October 3, 2009. (7) Amounts include items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $233 million and related interest and penalties of $71 million at October 3, 2009, recorded as liabilities. During fiscal 2010, tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately $30 million, either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance. The maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at October 3, 2009, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock suppliers net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $250 million, or approximately $178 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables. The minority partner in our Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods joint ventures in China has the right to exercise put options to require us to purchase their entire 40% equity interest at a price equal to the minority partners contributed capital plus (minus) its pro rata share of the joint ventures accumulated and undistributed net earnings (losses). The put options are exercisable for a five year term commencing the later of (i) April 2011 or (ii) the date upon which a shareholder of the minority partner is no longer general manager of the joint venture operations. At October 3, 2009, the put options, if they had been exercisable, would have resulted in a purchase price of approximately $74 million for the minority partners entire equity interest. RECENTLY ISSUED/ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1: Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and Note 2: Change in Accounting Principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Contingent liabilities We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable. Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Marketing and advertising costs We incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in store display incentives, coupons and other programs. Marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. We accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program. Cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. The remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. Recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program. These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% change in our marketing accruals at October 3, 2009, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $9 million. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Accrued self insurance We are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. We use an independent third party actuary to assist in determining our self insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range. Our self insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used. Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self insurance liability to change. Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self insurance liability to change. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% increase in the actuarial range at October 3, 2009, would result in an increase in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately $15 million. A 10% decrease in the actuarial range at October 3, 2009, would result in a reduction in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately $3 million. Impairment of long lived assets Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset or a change in its physical condition. When evaluating long lived assets for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long lived asset. We recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets of $25 million, $52 million and $6 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset, including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long lived assets during the last three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long lived assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit). For other intangible assets, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, generally our operating segments, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. Assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period. While estimating the fair value of our Chicken and Beef reporting units, we assumed operating margins in future years in excess of the annualized margins realized in the most current year. The fair value estimates for these reporting units assume normalized operating margin assumptions and improved operating efficiencies based on long term expectations and margins historically realized in the beef and chicken industries. We estimate the fair value of our Chicken reporting unit would be in excess of its carrying amount, including goodwill, by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 5.0%. After the $560 million non cash impairment recognized in fiscal 2009, we estimate the fair value of our Beef reporting unit would be in excess of its carrying amount, including goodwill, by sustaining long term operating margins of approximately 2.0%. Other intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years. The recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions led to an increase in our discount rate. The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 10.1% in fiscal 2009 from 9.3% in fiscal 2008. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions. As a result of the significantly increased discount rate, we failed the first step of the fiscal 2009 goodwill impairment analysis for our Beef reporting unit and performed the second step. The second step resulted in a $560 million non cash partial impairment of the Beef reporting units goodwill. No other reporting units failed the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 and therefore, the second step was not necessary. However, a 10% decline in fair value of our Chicken reporting unit would have caused the carrying value for this reporting unit to be in excess of fair value which would require the second step to be performed. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for the Chicken reporting units goodwill. After the $560 million non cash impairment recognized in fiscal 2009, a 17% decline in fair value of our Beef reporting unit would have caused the adjusted carrying value for this reporting unit to be in excess of fair value. Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, and our credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill. Our fiscal 2009 other intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Income taxes We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States and be taxable, but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefits have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefits, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, we enter into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value is recognized immediately. Additionally, we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. With the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery, we record these positions at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales. The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. Commodities Risk: We purchase certain commodities, such as grains and livestock, in the course of normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, on the fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge derivative financial instruments. Effect of 10% change in fair value in millions 2009 2008 Livestock: Cattle $ 20 $ 78 Hogs 12 31 Grain 1 88 Interest Rate Risk: At October 3, 2009, we had fixed rate debt of $3.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 7.9%. We have exposure to changes in interest rates on this fixed rate debt. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $32 million at October 3, 2009, and $45 million at September 27, 2008. The fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and or published interest rates. At October 3, 2009, we had variable rate debt of $218 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates effective at October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, would have a minimal effect on interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk: We have foreign exchange gain/loss exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary currency exchanges we have exposure to are the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso, the European euro, the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real. We periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates effective at October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, related to the foreign exchange forward contracts would have a $15 million and $11 million, respectively, impact on pretax income. In the future, we may enter into more foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of our international growth strategy. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At October 3, 2009, and September 27, 2008, 13.0% and 12.2%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Wal Mart Stores, Inc. No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 10% of net accounts receivable.
