ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANYWe are one of the worlds largest meat protein companies and the second largest food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost of live cattle and hogs, raw materials, grain and feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.OVERVIEWGeneral As a result of improved internal performance, strong exports and favorable domestic chicken market conditions, our operating results remained strong in fiscal 2012 despite a $2.2 billion increase in input costs. The following are a few of the key drivers:We continued to focus on maximizing our margins through margin management and operational efficiency improvements. Margin management improvements occurred in the areas of mix, export sales, price optimization and value added products initiatives. The operational efficiencies occurred in the areas of yields, cost reduction and labor management.Domestic chicken market conditions improved in fiscal 2012 driven by reduced industry supplies. The improved domestic chicken market conditions were partially offset by operating losses in our foreign start up businesses. Our Beef segment experienced periods of reduced demand for beef products, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2012, but was able to remain profitable as a result of improved balance between beef demand and cattle supply. Our Pork segment remained within its normalized operating margin range despite periods of unfavorable pricing environments due to periods of increased domestic availability of pork products. Our Prepared Foods segment experienced favorable mix changes and lower raw material costs resulting in earnings within its operating margin range.Margins With an operating margin of 3.8% in fiscal 2012, we have achieved operating income exceeding $1.2 billion for three consecutive years. The following is a summary of operating margins by segment:Chicken 3.8% (or 4.0% excluding $15 million related to the impairment of non core assets)Beef 1.6%Pork 7.6%Prepared Foods 5.6%Debt and Liquidity During fiscal 2012, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flows. Additionally, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.50% senior notes due in 2022 and used the proceeds to retire all of our 10.50% senior notes due in 2014. As a result of this transaction, we will realize approximately $55 million in annualized interest savings. We also repurchased 12.5 million shares of our stock for $230 million under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2012. At September 29, 2012, we had $2.0 billion of liquidity, which includes the availability under our credit facility and $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Our accounting cycle resulted in a 52 week year for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. in millions, except per share data 2012 2011 2010Net income attributable to Tyson$583 $750 $780Net income attributable to Tyson per diluted share1.58 1.97 2.062012 Net income included the following items:$15 million non cash charge, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the impairment of non core assets in China; and$167 million pretax charge, or $0.29 per diluted share, related to the early extinguishment of debt.2011 Net income included the following items:$11 million gain, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to a sale of interests in an equity method investment; and$21 million reduction to income tax expense, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to a reversal of reserves for foreign uncertain tax positions.2010 Net income included the following items:$61 million in pretax charges, or $0.09 per diluted share, related to losses on notes repurchased during fiscal 2010;$29 million non cash, non tax deductible charge, or $0.07 per diluted share, related to a full goodwill impairment in an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit;$12 million non cash, non tax deductible charge, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to the impairment of an equity method investment; and$38 million pretax gain, or $0.06 per diluted share, from insurance proceeds.18Table of ContentsFISCAL 2013 OUTLOOKOur continued capital investment in our businesses, strong liquidity and reduced interest expense has put us in a strong position as we begin a challenging fiscal 2013. The drought conditions in the summer of 2012 reduced grain supplies, which will result in higher input costs as well as increased costs for cattle and hog producers. USDA data indicates in fiscal 2013 overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) is expected to decrease 2% compared to fiscal 2012, which should continue to support improved pricing. The following is a summary of the fiscal 2013 outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook on sales, capital expenditures, net interest expense, debt and liquidity, share repurchases and dividends:Chicken Current USDA data shows U.S. chicken production will be down slightly in fiscal 2013. Due to the reduced crop supply, we expect higher grain costs in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 of approximately $600 million. However, the capital investment and significant operational, mix and pricing improvements we have made in our Chicken segment have better positioned us to adapt to rising grain prices. For fiscal 2013, we anticipate our Chicken segment will remain profitable, but could be below our normalized range of 5.0% 7.0%.Beef We expect to see a reduction of industry fed cattle supplies of 2 3% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Although we generally expect adequate supplies in regions we operate our plants, there may be periods of imbalance of fed cattle supply and demand. We anticipate beef exports will remain strong. For fiscal 2013, we believe our Beef segment will remain profitable, but could be below our normalized range of 2.5% 4.5%.Pork We expect industry hog supplies in fiscal 2013 to be flat compared to fiscal 2012 and pork exports to remain strong. For fiscal 2013, we believe our Pork segment will be in or above our normalized range of 6.0% 8.0%. Prepared Foods We expect operational improvements and increased pricing to offset increased raw material costs. Because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature, we are typically able to offset rising input costs through increased pricing. For fiscal 2013, we believe our Prepared Foods segment will remain in its normalized range of 4.0% 6.0%.Sales We expect fiscal 2013 sales to increase to approximately $35 billion mostly resulting from price increases related to decreases in domestic availability of protein and rising raw material costs. Capital Expenditures Our preliminary capital expenditures plan for fiscal 2013 is approximately $550 million. The reduction in planned capital expenditures from fiscal 2012 is primarily a result of an anticipated rise in working capital needs in fiscal 2013. Once we gain more visibility into our working capital needs, or should forecasted conditions change, we may raise our capital expenditures target. We will continue to make significant investments in our production facilities for high return operational efficiencies, other profit improvement projects and development of our foreign operations.Net Interest Expense We expect fiscal 2013 net interest expense will approximate $140 million.Debt and Liquidity We do not have any significant maturities of debt due until October 2013. We may use our available cash to repurchase notes when available at attractive rates. Total liquidity at September 29, 2012, was $2.0 billion, well above our goal to maintain liquidity in excess of $1.2 billion.Share Repurchases We expect to continue repurchasing shares under our share repurchase plan. In fiscal 2012, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for approximately $230 million. As of September 29, 2012, 35.2 million shares remain authorized for repurchases. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, our working capital needs, market conditions, liquidity targets, our debt obligations and regulatory requirements.Dividends On November 15, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $0.10 per share on our Class A common stock and $0.09 per share on our Class B common stock. Additionally, the Board increased the quarterly dividend previously declared on August 3, 2012, to $0.05 per share on our Class A common stock and $0.045 per share on our Class B common stock. Both the special dividend and the increased quarterly dividend are payable on December 14, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2012. The Board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share on our Class A common stock and $0.045 per share on our Class B common stock, payable on March 31, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2013.19Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF RESULTS Salesin millions 2012 2011 2010Sales$33,278 $32,266 $28,430Change in sales volume(4.3)% 1.7% Change in average sales price7.7 % 11.8% Sales growth3.1 % 13.5% 2012 vs. 2011 Average Sales Price The increase in sales was largely due to an increase in average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $2.7 billion. All segments, with the exception of the Pork segment, had an increase in average sales prices largely due to continued tight domestic availability of protein and increased live and raw material costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average sales price in the Pork segment which was driven down by lower live hog costs.Sales Volume Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of $1.7 billion. All segments, with the exception of the Pork segment, had a decrease in sales volume, with the majority of the decrease in the Beef segment.2011 vs. 2010 Average Sales Price The increase in sales was largely due to an increase in average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $3.4 billion. While all segments had an increase in average sales prices mostly due to price increases associated with rising raw material costs, the majority of the increase was driven by the Beef and Pork segments.Sales Volume Sales were positively impacted by an increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $484 million. This was primarily due to increases in the Chicken and Pork segments, partially offset by decreases in the Beef and Prepared Foods segments.Cost of Salesin millions 2012 2011 2010Cost of sales$31,118 $30,067 $25,916Gross profit$2,160 $2,199 $2,514Cost of sales as a percentage of sales93.5% 93.2% 91.2%2012 vs. 2011 Cost of sales increased by approximately $1.0 billion. Higher input cost per pound increased cost of sales by approximately $2.2 billion, while lower sales volume decreased cost of sales $1.2 billion.The $2.2 billion impact of higher input costs per pound was primarily driven by:Increase in live cattle and hog costs of approximately $1.5 billion.Increase in grain and feed ingredients of $320 million and increase in other growout operating costs of $50 million in our Chicken segment.The $1.2 billion impact of lower sales volumes was driven by decreases in our Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments, partially offset by an increase in sales volume in our Pork segment.2011 vs. 2010 Cost of sales increased by approximately $4.1 billion. Higher input cost per pound increased cost of sales by approximately $3.7 billion, while higher sales volume increased cost of sales $445 million.The $3.7 billion impact of higher input costs per pound was primarily driven by:Increase in live cattle and hog costs of approximately $2.4 billion.Increase in grain and feed ingredients of $675 million and increase in other growout operating costs of $74 million in our Chicken segment, which were partially offset by approximately $200 million of operational improvements.Increase in raw material costs of $273 million in our Prepared Foods segment.The $0.4 billion impact of higher sales volumes was primarily driven by:Increases in sales volume in our Chicken and Pork segments partially offset by decreases in our Beef and Prepared Foods segments.Increase of $145 million of costs of sales associated with Dynamic Fuels, which commenced production activities in fiscal 2011.20Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrativein millions 2012 2011 2010Selling, general and administrative$912 $914 $929As a percentage of sales2.7% 2.8% 3.3%2011 vs. 2010 Decrease of $13 million related to reduced incentive based compensation awarded during fiscal 2011.Goodwill Impairmentin millions 2012 2011 2010 $ $ $292010 Included the full impairment of an immaterial Chicken segment reporting unit.

The decrease is due primarily to lower average weekly indebtedness of approximately 9% and 15% in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Additionally, the decrease in cash interest expense is due to lower average coupon rates compared to fiscal 2011 and 2010.Loss on early extinguishment of debt included the amount paid exceeding the par value of debt, unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs related to the full extinguishment of the 10.50% Senior Notes due 2014 (2014 Notes).Losses on notes repurchased during fiscal 2011 and 2010 included the amount paid exceeding the carrying value of the notes repurchased, which primarily included the repurchases of the 8.25% Notes due October 2011 (2011 Notes) and the 6.60% Senior Notes due April 2016 (2016 Notes).Non cash interest expense primarily included interest related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts/premiums on note issuances. This included debt issuance costs incurred on our revolving credit facility, the 2014 Notes, the 4.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (2022 Notes) issued in June 2012, as well as the accretion of the debt discount on the 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (2013 Notes), 2014 Notes and 2022 Notes.Other (Income) Expense, netin millions 2012 2011 2010 $(23) $(20) $202012 Included $16 million of equity earnings in joint ventures and $4 million in net foreign currency exchange gains.2011 Included $11 million gain related to a sale of interests in an equity method investment.2010 Included $12 million charge related to the impairment of an equity method investment.21Table of ContentsEffective Tax Rate 2012 2011 2010 37.9% 31.8% 36.4%The effective tax rate on continuing operations was impacted by a number of items which result in a difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35%.

These production cuts reduced our total domestic slaughter pounds by approximately 4% in fiscal 2012, but were partially offset by increases in international sales volumes and open market meat purchases.Average Sales Price The increase in average sales prices is primarily due to mix changes and price increases associated with reduced industry supply and increased input costs.Operating Income The increase in operating income was largely due to the increase in average sales price and operational improvements, partially offset by reduced sales volumes, increased grain, feed ingredients and other growout costs and losses incurred in our foreign start up businesses.Grain, Feed Ingredients and Growout Costs Operating results were negatively impacted in fiscal 2012 by an increase in grain and feed ingredients costs of $320 million and an increase in other growout operating costs of $50 million.Operational Improvements Operating results were positively impacted by approximately $115 million of operational improvements, primarily attributed to improvements in yield, mix and processing optimization. Start up Businesses Our foreign start up businesses in Brazil and China incurred operating losses of approximately $105 million in fiscal 2012, which included $15 million for the impairment of non core assets.

Sales volume decreased due to a reduction in live cattle processed and outside tallow purchases. Operating income decreased due to higher fed cattle costs and periods of reduced demand for beef products, which made it difficult to pass along increased input costs, as well as lower sales volumes and increased employee related operating costs.Derivative Activities Operating results included the following amounts for commodity risk management activities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle.

Because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature, we typically offset changing input costs through pricing. However, there is a lag time for price changes to take effect, which is what we experienced during fiscal 2011.2011 vs. 2010 Sales and Operating Income Despite the increase in average sales prices, operating income remained flat, excluding $8 million in insurance proceeds in fiscal 2010 related to flood damage at our Jefferson, Wisconsin plant. The increase in average sales prices were offset by lower volumes, increased raw material costs of $273 million and increased operational costs of $50 million, primarily attributable to employee related costs and plant variances mostly due to lower volumes.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, the repurchases of senior notes and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided by operating activities, or short term borrowings. Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on: our operating performance and other circumstances; our then current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.Cash Flows from Operating Activities in millions 2012 2011 2010Net income$576 $733 $765Non cash items in net income: Depreciation and amortization499 506 497Deferred income taxes140 86 18Loss on early extinguishment of debt167 Impairment of goodwill 29Impairment of assets34 18 36Other, net18 49 76Net changes in working capital(247) (346) 11Net cash provided by operating activities$1,187 $1,046 $1,432Cash flows associated with Loss on early extinguishment of debt included the amount paid exceeding the par value of debt, unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs related to the full extinguishment of the 2014 Notes.Cash flows associated with changes in working capital:2012 Decreased due to the increase in inventory and accounts receivable balances, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable.

In fiscal 2012 and 2011, our capital spending was primarily for production efficiencies in our operations and for ongoing development of foreign operations. In fiscal 2010, our capital spending was primarily related to production efficiencies in our operations, construction of Dynamic Fuels facility and development of our foreign operations. Capital spending for fiscal 2013 is expected to approximate $550 million, and includes spending on our operations for production and labor efficiencies, yield improvements and sales channel flexibility, as well as expansion of our foreign operations. The reduction in planned capital expenditures from fiscal 2012 is primarily a result of an anticipated rise in working capital needs in fiscal 2013. Once we gain more visibility into our working capital needs, or should forecasted conditions change, we may raise our capital expenditures target. Purchases of marketable securities included funding for our deferred compensation plans.Proceeds from notes receivable totaling $51 million in fiscal 2011 related to the collection of notes receivable received in conjunction with the sale of a business operation in fiscal 2009.Change in restricted cash In fiscal 2009, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in proceeds from the sale of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax exempt bonds made available by the federal government to the regions affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.

The transaction closed in fiscal 2011 for cash consideration totaling $66 million.Purchases of Tyson Class A common stock include:$230 million and $170 million for shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively; and$34 million, $37 million and $48 million for shares repurchased to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.28Table of Contents Liquidity in millions CommitmentsExpiration Date FacilityAmount Outstanding Letters ofCredit under RevolvingCredit Facility (no draw downs) AmountBorrowed AmountAvailableCash and cash equivalents $1,071Revolving credit facility August 2017 $1,000 $38 $ $962Total liquidity $2,033The revolving credit facility supports our short term funding needs and letters of credit. The letters of credit issued under this facility are primarily in support of workers compensation insurance programs and derivative activities.Our 2013 Notes may be converted to Class A stock early during any fiscal quarter in the event our Class A stock trades at or above $21.96 for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. In this event, the note holders may require us to pay outstanding principal in cash, which totaled $458 million at September 29, 2012. Any conversion premium would be paid in shares of Class A stock. The conditions for early conversion were not met in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and thus, the notes may not be converted in our first quarter of fiscal 2013. On and after July 15, 2013, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, which is October 15, 2013, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Due to the early conversion option regardless of conversion conditions beginning in July 2013, we have recorded the 2013 Notes balance of $458 million and remaining discount of $22 million as Current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 29, 2012. Should the holders exercise their early conversion option, we would use current cash on hand and or cash flow from operations for principal payments. We presently plan to use current cash on hand and or cash flows from operations for payment on the 2013 Notes not converted early upon maturity. At September 29, 2012, approximately 29% of our cash is held in the international accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. Generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, but rather we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. Our U.S. income taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.Our current ratio was 1.91 to 1 and 2.01 to 1 at September 29, 2012, and October 1, 2011, respectively.Capital ResourcesCredit FacilityCash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed maximum capacity of $1.0 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities. As of September 29, 2012, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $38 million issued under this facility, none of which were drawn upon, which left $962 million available for borrowing. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 43 banks, with commitments ranging from $0.3 million to $90 million per bank. The syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements.CapitalizationTo monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. We monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long term financing decisions. At September 29, 2012, and October 1, 2011, the ratio of our debt to total capitalization was 28.7% and 27.7%, respectively. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of current and long term debt. Total capitalization is defined as debt plus Total Shareholders Equity. Our ratio of debt to our total capitalization increased in fiscal 2012 primarily resulting from the net increase in our debt balance from issuing the $1.0 billion 2022 Notes and extinguishing the $810 million 2014 Notes.29Table of ContentsCredit Ratings2016 NotesOn November 13, 2008, Moodys Investors Service, Inc.

In addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios.Our 2022 Notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 29, 2012.OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.30Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 29, 2012: in millions Payments Due by Period 2013 2014 2015 2016 1017 2018 and thereafter TotalDebt and capital lease obligations: Principal payments (1)$537 $35 $650 $1,238 $2,460Interest payments (2)122 232 138 260 752Guarantees (3)21 56 24 32 133Operating lease obligations (4)101 119 53 55 328Purchase obligations (5)819 109 61 86 1,075Capital expenditures (6)400 33 433Other long term liabilities (7)8 5 4 30 47Total contractual commitments$2,008 $589 $930 $1,701 $5,228(1) In the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.(2) Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at September 29, 2012, and expected payment dates.(3) Amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of a lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.(4) Amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.(5) Amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees that provide terms that meet the above criteria. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and may not be considered an enforceable and legally binding contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.(6) Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of September 29, 2012.(7) Amounts include items that meet the definition of a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $168 million and related interest and penalties of $64 million at September 29, 2012, recorded as liabilities. During fiscal 2013, tax audit resolutions could potentially change these amounts by approximately $20 million because tax positions are sustained on audit.The maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at September 29, 2012, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock suppliers net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $275 million, or approximately $250 million remaining maximum commitment after netting the cash flow assistance related receivables.RECENTLY ISSUED/ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1: Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for recently issued accounting pronouncements and Note 2: Changes in Accounting Principles for recently adopted accounting pronouncements.31Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptionsContingent liabilities We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable. Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Marketing and advertising costs We incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in store display incentives, coupons and other programs. Marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. We accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program. Cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. The remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. Recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program. These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% change in our marketing accruals at September 29, 2012, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $15 million.32Table of ContentsDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptionsAccrued self insurance We are self insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. We use an independent third party actuary to assist in determining our self insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range. Our self insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used. Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self insurance liability to change. Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self insurance liability to change. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% increase in the actuarial estimate at September 29, 2012, would result in an increase in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately $6 million. A 10% decrease in the actuarial estimate at September 29, 2012, would result in a decrease in the amount we recorded for our self insurance liability of approximately $23 million. Impairment of long lived assets Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset or a change in its physical condition. When evaluating long lived assets for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the long lived asset. We recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets of $25 million, $15 million and $19 million, respectively, in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions and estimates surrounding undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset, including forecasting useful lives of assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.Our Dynamic Fuels consolidated joint venture began commercial operations in October of 2010 and has incurred net operating losses of $14 million and $24 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The plant has experienced mechanical difficulties, pre treatment system performance issues and hydrogen supply disruptions, which have contributed to plant down time and higher than expected operational costs. Upgrades to the feedstock pre treatment systems and improvements to the mechanical reliability of the plant are currently ongoing. If the plant upgrades and improvements fail to improve operational performance, or should industry economics make the plant uneconomical to operate, we may be required to assess the recoverability of Dynamic Fuels long lived assets to determine whether an impairment exists.Additionally, we continue to evaluate our international operations and strategies, which may expose us to future impairment losses. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long lived assets during the last three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long lived assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. 33Table of ContentsDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptionsIncome taxes We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the United States and be taxable, but not for earnings considered indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assetsDescription: Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macro economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. Additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any.The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business).For other indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. Similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2012 impairment test.We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.34Table of ContentsJudgments and Uncertainties: We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, generally our operating segments, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.We include assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period. Generally, we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units industries. For the fiscal 2012 impairment test of material reporting units, our Domestic Chicken and Beef reporting units generally utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margin realized in the most recent year.Our Domestic Chicken reporting unit had goodwill at September 29, 2012, totaling $900 million or 95% of our Chicken segments goodwill. We generally assumed operating margins in future years would return to our normalized range of 5.0% to 7.0%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have still passed the first step of the annual impairment test. Valuing the Domestic Chicken reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 3.3% (breakeven), or a 2.3% increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2012, would have caused the carrying value of the Domestic Chicken reporting unit to be in excess of fair value, which would have required the second step to be performed. Although our Domestic Chicken reporting unit realized operating margins in fiscal 2012 in excess of the breakeven operating margins required to pass the first step, the Domestic Chicken reporting unit may be challenged in fiscal 2013 to realize this level of operating margins, due to the expected temporary challenging market conditions in fiscal 2013. Our Beef reporting unit, which is our Beef operating segment, had goodwill at September 29, 2012, totaling $563 million. We generally assumed operating margins in future years would return to our normalized range of 2.5% to 4.5%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have still passed the first step of the annual impairment test. Valuing the Beef reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 1.4% (breakeven), or a 3.6% increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2012, would have caused the carrying value of the Beef reporting unit to be in excess of fair value, which would have required the second step to be performed. Although our Beef reporting unit realized operating margins in fiscal 2012 in excess of the breakeven operating margins required to pass the first step, the Beef reporting unit may be challenged in fiscal 2013 to realize this level of operating margins, due to the expected temporary challenging market conditions in fiscal 2013. Other indefinite life intangible asset fair values have been calculated for trademarks using a royalty rate method. Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar brands and trademarks are licensed in the marketplace.Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions: We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the last three years other than the adoption of the new guidance allowing the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative impairment test.The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test decreased to an average of 8.0% in fiscal 2012 from 8.8% in fiscal 2011. There were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions.During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore, the second step was not necessary. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a $29 million full impairment of an immaterial Chicken segment reporting units goodwill.Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates and our credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other indefinite life intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step, which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.All of our material reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. Consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test.Our fiscal 2012 other indefinite life intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in a material impairment charge. A hypothetical 20% decrease in the fair value of intangible assets would not result in a material impairment.35Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, we enter into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value is recognized immediately. Additionally, we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. With the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery, we record these positions at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in cost of sales.The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes.Commodities Risk: We purchase certain commodities, such as grains and livestock, in the course of normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of September 29, 2012, and October 1, 2011, on the fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge derivative financial instruments.Effect of 10% change in fair valuein millions 2012 2011Livestock: Cattle$42 $34Hogs37 57Grain30 11Interest Rate Risk: At September 29, 2012, we had variable rate debt of $219 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates effective at September 29, 2012, and October 1, 2011, would have a minimal effect on interest expense.Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt. At September 29, 2012, we had fixed rate debt of $2.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $16 million at September 29, 2012, and $5 million at October 1, 2011. The fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and or published interest rates.Foreign Currency Risk: We have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary currencies we have exposure to are the Brazilian real, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the European euro, and the Mexican peso. We periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates effective at September 29, 2012, and October 1, 2011, related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have a $21 million and $18 million impact, respectively, on pretax income. In the future, we may enter into more foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a result of our international growth strategy.36Table of ContentsConcentrations of Credit Risk: Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 29, 2012, and October 1, 2011, 17.1% and 16.5%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Wal Mart Stores, Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented greater than 10% of net accounts receivable.37Table of Contents
