Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The "Financial Review" Section which is set forth on pages F 3 through F 13 of the Financial Appendix to TSYS Proxy Statement in connection with its Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on April 18, 2002, which includes the information encompassed within "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," is specifically incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk. TSYS is exposed to foreign exchange risk because it has revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies including Euro, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen. These currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, except for revenues, costs and expenses, and net income, which are translated at the average exchange rate for each reporting period. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of TSYS foreign operations, net of tax, are accumulated in a separate section of shareholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount of other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1,841,657, $159,973 and $274,371, respectively. Currently, TSYS does not use financial instruments to hedge its exposure to exchange rate changes. 6 The carrying value of the assets of its foreign operations in Europe, Mexico, Canada and Japan was approximately (in U.S. dollars) $75,100,000, $4,000,000, $166,000 and $5,500,000, respectively, at December 31, 2001. Interest Rate Risk. TSYS is also exposed to interest rate risk associated with the investing of available cash and the lease on its campus facilities. TSYS invests available cash in conservative short term instruments and is primarily subject to changes in the prime rate. The payments under the operating lease arrangement of the campus facilities are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). TSYS locks into interest rates for six month intervals. The extent that rates change in a six month period represents TSYS exposure. The following represents the potential effect on operating income of hypothetical shifts in the LIBOR of plus or minus 50 basis points, 100 basis points and 150 points over a 12 month period. Effect of a Basis Point Change of : +/ 50 +/ 100 +/ 150 Effect on operating income $ 143,000 287,000 430,000 The lease is scheduled to expire in November 2002. However, TSYS has the option to either renew the lease subject to prevailing market rates or to purchase the property at the original cost of the property. As a result, TSYS could have an interest rate risk in the future associated with a future obligation with respect to the corporate campus. Concentration of Credit Risk. TSYS works to maintain a large and diverse customer base across various industries to minimize the credit risk of any one customer to TSYS accounts receivable amounts. In addition, TSYS performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and suppliers financial condition. TSYS does, however, have two major customers that account for a large portion of its revenues, which subject it to credit risk. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F 26 and F 27 of the Financial Appendix to TSYS Proxy Statement in connection with its Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on April 18, 2002 which is specifically incorporated herein by reference for description of major customers. In late 2001, one of TSYS major customers made several announcements regarding concerns about its financial status, related changes in management and the sale of a portion of its portfolio. As a result of the announcements, TSYS management is actively monitoring the clients status through frequent interaction.
