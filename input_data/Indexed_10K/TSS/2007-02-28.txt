Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Financial Overview and Financial Review Sections which are set forth on pages 22 through 50 of the Annual Report which includes the information encompassed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are incorporated in this document by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk because we have assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies including the Euro, British Pounds Sterling (BPS), Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Brazilian Real, Cypriot Pounds and Malaysian Ringgets. These currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, except for revenues, costs and expenses and net income, which are translated at the average exchange rate for each reporting period. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, net of tax, are accumulated in a separate section of shareholders equity entitled accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of other comprehensive income related to foreign currency translation for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $15.9 million net of tax. The amount of other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $9.6 million. The amount of other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $7.1 million net of tax. Currently, we do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate changes. The following table presents the carrying value of the net assets of our foreign operations in U.S. dollars at December 31, 2006: (in millions) December 31, 2006 Europe $ 165.1 China 55.6 Japan 7.7 Mexico 6.9 Canada 0.7 Other 7.6 We record foreign currency translation adjustments associated with other balance sheet accounts. See Nonoperating Income (Expense) under the Financial Review Section on page 42 of the Annual Report which is incorporated in this document by reference. We maintain several cash accounts denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Euros and BPS. As we translate the foreign denominated cash balances into U.S. dollars, the translated cash balance is adjusted upward or downward depending upon the foreign currency exchange movements. The upward or downward adjustment is recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in our statements of income. As those cash accounts have increased, the upward or downward adjustments have increased. We recorded a translation loss of approximately $1.7 million for the year ended 11 Table of Contents December 31, 2006 relating to the translation of cash accounts. The balance of the foreign denominated cash accounts subject to risk of translation gains or losses at December 31, 2006 was approximately $32.8 million, the majority of which is denominated in Euros. We provide financing to our international operations in Europe and Japan through intercompany loans that require each operation to repay the financing in U.S. dollars. The functional currency of each operation is the respective local currency. As we translate the foreign currency denominated financial statements into U.S. dollars, the translated balance of the financing (liability) is adjusted upward or downward to match the U.S. dollar obligation (receivable) on our financial statements. The upward or downward adjustment is recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation. As a result of these financing arrangements, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain on our financing with foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2006 of $3.8 million. The balance of the financing arrangements at December 31, 2006 was approximately $64 million. To follow is a summary of account balances subject to foreign currency exchange rates between the local currencies and the U.S. dollar: Balance at December 31, (in thousands) 2006 Asset Cash $ 32,767 Liability Intercompany financing arrangements (63,954 ) Net account balances $ (31,187 ) The following table presents the potential effect on income before income taxes of hypothetical shifts in the foreign currency exchange rate between the local currencies and the U.S. dollar of plus or minus 100 basis points, 500 basis points and 1,000 basis points based on the net liability account balance of $31.2 million at December 31, 2006.

Interest Rate Risk. We are also exposed to interest rate risk associated with the investing of available cash. We invest available cash in conservative short term instruments and are primarily subject to changes in the short term interest rates. 12 Table of Contents
