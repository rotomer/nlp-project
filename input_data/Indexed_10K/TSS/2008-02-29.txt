Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk because we have assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. These currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, except for revenues, costs and expenses and net income, which are translated at the average exchange rate for each reporting period. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, net of tax, are accumulated in a separate section of shareholders equity entitled accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $7.6 million. The amount of other comprehensive 12 Table of Contents income related to foreign currency translation for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $15.9 million net of tax. The amount of other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $9.6 million. Currently, we do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate changes. The following table presents the carrying value of the net assets of our foreign operations in U.S. dollars at December 31, 2007: (in millions) December 31, 2007 Europe $ 136.7 China 62.3 Japan 5.8 Mexico 8.1 Canada 0.3 Other 11.2 We record foreign currency translation adjustments associated with other balance sheet accounts. See Nonoperating Income (Expense) under the Financial Review Section on page 36 of the Annual Report which is incorporated in this document by reference. We maintain several cash accounts denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Euros and BPS. As we translate the foreign denominated cash balances into U.S. dollars, the translated cash balance is adjusted upward or downward depending upon the foreign currency exchange movements. The upward or downward adjustment is recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in our statements of income. As those cash accounts have increased, the upward or downward adjustments have increased. We recorded a net translation loss of approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to the translation of foreign denominated balance sheet accounts, most of which were cash. The balance of the foreign denominated cash accounts subject to risk of translation gains or losses at December 31, 2007 was approximately $10.5 million, the majority of which is denominated in Euros. We provide financing to our international operations in Europe and Japan through intercompany loans that require each operation to repay the financing in U.S. dollars. The functional currency of each operation is the respective local currency. As we translate the foreign currency denominated financial statements into U.S. dollars, the translated balance of the financing (liability) is adjusted upward or downward to match the U.S. dollar obligation (receivable) on our financial statements. The upward or downward adjustment is recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation. As a result of these financing arrangements, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain on our financing with foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2007 of $2.6 million. The balance of the financing arrangements at December 31, 2006 was approximately $4.9 million. 13 Table of Contents To follow is a summary of account balances subject to foreign currency exchange rates between the local currencies and the U.S. dollar: Balance at (in thousands) December 31, 2007 Asset Cash $ 10,496 Liability Intercompany financing arrangements (4,865 ) Net account balances $ 5,631 The following table presents the potential effect on income before income taxes of hypothetical shifts in the foreign currency exchange rate between the local currencies and the U.S. dollar of plus or minus 100 basis points, 500 basis points and 1,000 basis points based on the net asset account balance of $5.6 million at December 31, 2007.
