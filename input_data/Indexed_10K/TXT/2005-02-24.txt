Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview Textron Inc. is a multi industry company that leverages its global network of businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services in five business segments: Bell, Cessna, Fastening Systems, Industrial and Finance. Textron is known around the world for its powerful brands spanning the business jet, aerospace and defense, fastening systems, plastic fuel systems, golf car and turf care markets, among others. Economic conditions improved in 2004, with the majority of our end markets benefiting from the turnaround. Sales volumes in our manufacturing businesses reflected this recovery. Most notably, a steady flow of military orders at Bell resulted from increased spending in the defense sector, while Cessna saw a significant increase in new business jet orders as a result of improvements in the aircraft sector. In addition, our Finance segment experienced significant improvement in its portfolio credit quality with fewer charge offs and a decrease in nonperforming assets. Textron was, however, affected by commodity inflation in most of its businesses during 2004, including the sharp rise in steel prices which had an $81 million unfavorable impact, primarily in our Fastening Systems and Industrial segments. As a result of escalating steel prices, we took actions to raise prices and impose surcharges on many of our steel products, primarily in our Fastening Systems segment, to mitigate the impact of the higher material costs. While many of these actions were taken in 2004, we believe it will take a few quarters to determine what impact our pricing actions will have on our customers and volumes. In addition to the higher commodity costs, pension expense increased $36 million. We were able to absorb the impact of these factors primarily as a result of our transformation strategy through ongoing cost reduction initiatives, lean manufacturing, integrated supply chain and restructuring. We intend to continue to execute our transformation strategy and strengthen our portfolio through the divestiture of non core businesses and strategic acquisitions to further position Textron to take advantage of the improved economic conditions. Consolidated Results of Operations 2004 Revenues $10.2 Billion 2004 Segment Profit* $903 Million * Segment profit represents the measurement used by Textron to evaluate performance for decision making purposes. Segment profit for manufacturing segments does not include interest expense, certain corporate expenses, special charges, and gains and losses from the disposition of significant business units. The measurement for the finance segment includes interest income, interest expense and distributions on preferred securities of Finance subsidiary trust, and excludes special charges. Revenues Revenues increased $450 million in 2004 primarily due to the favorable foreign exchange impact of $287 million, higher volume of $93 million in the manufacturing businesses, the additional revenue of $76 million from the consolidation of CitationShares and higher pricing of $45 million. The decrease of $479 million in 2003 was primarily due to lower Citation business jet volume of $876 million at Cessna, due to a depressed market and the reduction of 2003 deliveries by a major fractional jet customer, and lower sales volume of $123 million at E Z GO and Jacobsen, due to a depressed golf market. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact of $313 million in the Industrial and Fastening Systems segments and increased volume of $131 million at Kautex. Segment Profit Segment profit increased $132 million in 2004 primarily due to $303 million in cost reduction initiatives, a $77 million benefit from restructuring activities and $45 million of higher pricing. These increases were partially offset by inflation of $254 million. 12 The decrease of $133 million in 2003 was primarily due to lower profit of $177 million at Cessna and $52 million at E Z GO and Jacobsen largely due to lower sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher profit of $65 million at Bell primarily in its aircraft engine and commercial helicopter businesses due to certain costs incurred in 2002, as described in the Bell segment section. Special Charges Special charges are summarized below: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Restructuring $ 143 $ 137 $ 93 Unamortized issuance costs on preferred securities 15 Gain on sale of C&A common stock (12 ) C&A common stock impairment 38 Total special charges $ 131 $ 152 $ 131 Restructuring Program To improve returns at core businesses and to complete the integration of certain acquisitions, Textron approved and committed to a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2000 based upon targeted cost reductions. This program was expanded in 2001, and in October 2002 Textron announced a further expansion of the program as part of its strategic effort to improve operating efficiencies, primarily in its industrial businesses. Textrons restructuring program includes corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions, consolidation of facilities primarily in the United States and Europe, rationalization of certain product lines, outsourcing of non core production activity, the divestiture of non core businesses, and streamlining of sales and administrative overhead. Under this restructuring program, Textron has reduced its workforce by approximately 11,000 employees from continuing operations, representing approximately 19% of its global workforce since the restructuring was first announced. A total of 107 facilities have been closed under this program, including 45 manufacturing plants, primarily in the Industrial and Fastening Systems segments. In total, Textron estimates that the entire program for continuing operations will be approximately $540 million (including $11 million related to the divested Automotive Trim business (Trim)). As of January 1, 2005, $519 million of cost has been incurred relating to continuing operations (including $11 million related to Trim), with $213 million in the Industrial segment, $219 million in the Fastening Systems segment, $38 million in the Cessna segment, $29 million in the Bell segment, $9 million in the Finance segment and $11 million at Corporate. Costs incurred through January 1, 2005 include $268 million in severance costs, $98 million in asset impairment charges (net of gains on the sale of fixed assets), $54 million in contract termination costs and $99 million in other associated costs. Unamortized Issuance Costs In July 2003, Textron redeemed its 7.92% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2045. The debentures were held by Textrons wholly owned trust, and the proceeds from their redemption were used to redeem all of the $500 million Textron Capital I trust preferred securities. Upon the redemption, $15 million of unamortized issuance costs were written off. C&A Common Stock During the second half of 2002, the Collins & Aikman Corporation common stock owned by Textron experienced a decline in market value. Textron acquired this stock as a result of the disposition of the Trim business to various operating subsidiaries of Collins & Aikman Corporation (collectively C&A). In December 2002, Moodys Investor Services (Moodys) lowered its liquidity rating of C&A. Due to this indicator and the extended length of time and extent to which the market value of the stock was less than the carrying value, Textron determined that the decline in the market value of the stock was other than temporary and wrote down its investment in the stock for a pre tax loss of $38 million. Textron sold its remaining investment in C&A common stock for cash proceeds of $34 million and recorded a pre tax gain of $12 million in the first quarter of 2004. Corporate Expenses Corporate expenses and other, net increased $30 million in 2004 primarily due to nonrecurring income in 2003 and increases in certain expenses in 2004. The nonrecurring income in 2003 included $7 million related to an expired royalty agreement and $7 million in proceeds from life insurance policies. In 2004, we also experienced higher premiums for Directors and Officers insurance of $6 million, provided $5 million in funding to Textrons charitable trust and had $4 million in higher executive compensation primarily related to improved operating results. 13 Income from Continuing Operations Fluctuations in income from continuing operations are primarily driven by segment profit changes as discussed above. In addition, Textron recorded certain items that affected the comparability of operating results in the last three years which are summarized in the table below: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Special charges $ 131 $ 152 $ 131 Gain on sale of businesses (15 ) (25 ) 131 137 106 Income tax benefit on above items (35 ) (41 ) (27 ) $ 96 $ 96 $ 79 Gain on sale of businesses includes a gain of $15 million on the sale of Textrons remaining interest in an Italian automotive joint venture to C&A in 2003 and a $25 million gain in 2002 from transactions related to the divestiture of Trim. Income Taxes A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is provided below: 2004 2003 2002 Federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from: State income taxes 1.6 2.3 1.8 Special foreign dividend 2.1 Permanent items from Trim divestiture 1.2 Favorable tax settlements (3.1 ) (2.1 ) ESOP dividends (1.6 ) (2.2 ) (3.1 ) Foreign tax rate differential (5.9 ) (2.1 ) (0.5 ) Export sales benefit (1.1 ) (1.4 ) (1.5 ) Other, net (0.7 ) (1.6 ) (0.2 ) Effective income tax rate 29.4 % 26.9 % 30.6 % We expect our effective tax rate for 2005 will remain consistent with 2004. Discontinued Operations During the fourth quarter of 2004, Textron reached a final decision to sell the remainder of its InteSys operations. As a result of these actions, financial results of these businesses, net of income taxes, are now reported as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations also reflect the after tax gain in the second quarter of 2004 from the sale of InteSys two Brazilian based joint ventures. In the third quarter of 2003, Textron sold certain assets and liabilities related to its remaining OmniQuip business to JLG Industries, Inc. for $90 million in cash and a $10 million note that was paid in full in February 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Textron Financial sold substantially all of its small business direct portfolio to MBNA America Bank, N.A. for $421 million in cash. The InteSys and OmniQuip businesses were previously reported within the Industrial segment and the small business direct portfolio was previously reported within the Finance segment. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle During 2002, Textron recorded an after tax transitional impairment charge of $488 million upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as more fully discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook We expect a modest increase in revenues in 2005 with higher revenue at Bell, Cessna and Finance, while the industrial businesses are expected to be relatively flat. At Bell, the expected revenue increase is primarily related to higher V 22 revenue from new production releases (recorded on an as delivered basis), which is expected to more than offset lower engineering and development based revenues (recorded on a cost incurred basis). At Cessna, we expect an increase in revenue due to higher sales of jets based on our current backlog. Overall segment profit and margins are expected to increase as Textron continues to realize the benefits of its cost reduction initiatives and substantially completed restructuring program. 14 Textrons commercial backlog from unaffiliated customers was $6.8 billion and $5.0 billion at the end of 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is primarily related to Cessna. U.S. Government backlog was $3.3 billion and $1.9 billion at the end of 2004 and 2003, respectively, which was substantially all in the Bell segment. See Backlog in Item 1. Business of Textron on page 6 for more information. Segment Analysis Bell (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 2,254 $ 2,348 $ 2,235 Segment profit $ 250 $ 234 $ 169 Profit margin 11 % 10 % 8 % Backlog $ 3,775 $ 2,197 $ 1,815 Bell is a leading manufacturer of advanced military helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Government and commercial helicopters for corporate, offshore petroleum exploration and development, utility, charter, police, fire, rescue and emergency medical customers. Additionally, Bell is a primary supplier of advanced weapon systems to meet the demanding needs of the aerospace and defense markets and the leading manufacturer of piston aircraft engines. Bell Helicopter has two major programs with the U.S. Government the V 22 and the H 1 Upgrade Program. The V 22 is the pioneer program for tiltrotor technology with a current requirement of 458 aircraft. Bell expects to receive authorization to proceed to full rate production of the V 22 in 2005. The H 1 Upgrade Program is a major contract to remanufacture the U.S. Marine Corps fleet of AH 1W SuperCobra and UH 1N utility helicopters to an advanced configuration featuring common avionics and flight dynamics. Bell expects to receive authorization to proceed to full rate production in 2006 for 100 UH 1N and 180 AH 1W helicopters. Bell currently has orders for six UH 1Y aircraft and three AH 1Z aircraft, and expects to begin deliveries in 2006. Bell Helicopter continues to manufacture aircraft under the V 22 low rate initial production releases that began prior to 2003. Revenues under those releases are recorded on a cost incurred basis primarily as a result of the significant engineering effort required over a lengthy period of time during the initial development phase in relation to total contract volume. Revenues for those releases are expected to decline through 2007 as the remaining effort is completed. The development effort was substantially complete for new production releases in 2003, and revenue on those releases will be recognized as units are delivered, which is expected to begin in 2005. Accordingly, during 2005, V 22 program revenues related to new production releases recorded on an as delivered basis are expected to more than offset lower revenues associated with the diminishing development revenues recorded as costs are incurred. During 2004, Bell Helicopters commercial business rebounded with increases in orders, deliveries and backlog. Bell continued to invest in commercial programs as evidenced by the significant progress made on the newly announced 429 light twin aircraft and other program upgrades in response to customer requests to improve speed, lower operating costs and reduce noise. In December 2004, the Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company, L.L.C. received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certification of the AB139 helicopter. Additionally, Textron Systems has received orders to deliver over 200 armored security vehicles (ASV) in 2005 with additional orders expected. Currently, production capacity is ramping up to meet these deliveries. Bell Revenues The Bell segments revenues decreased $94 million in 2004, compared with 2003, due to lower revenue of $166 million in the U.S. Government business, partially offset by higher commercial sales of $72 million. U.S. Government sales decreased primarily due to lower revenue of $243 million on the V 22 program and lower sales of $30 million related to a contract for training aircraft completed in 2003. In addition, revenue was reduced by $11 million related to a final agreement with the U.S. Government to settle an overhead cost rate matter. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by $34 million of higher military spares volume, increased sales of $34 million for air launched weapons and higher H 1 revenue of $34 million. Commercial revenues increased primarily due to higher foreign military sales of $64 million, increased volume in the aircraft engine business of $18 million and higher spares volume of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by lower Huey II kit sales of $16 million and lower sales of commercial aircraft of $6 million. The lower V 22 revenue was primarily due to lower effort of $170 million on production lots three through six as these contracts near completion and decreasing development activities of $98 million. 15 The Bell segments revenues increased $113 million in 2003, compared with 2002, due to higher U.S. Government revenue of $62 million primarily due to the ongoing development efforts on the V 22 program and higher foreign military sales volume of $35 million related to a contract that began shipments during the third quarter of 2002. Bell Segment Profit Segment profit increased $16 million in 2004, compared with 2003, due to higher profit of $47 million in the commercial business, partially offset by the impact of lower revenue of $31 million in the U.S. Government business. Commercial profit increased primarily due to the $34 million impact of the higher foreign military sales, favorable cost performance in the commercial helicopter business of $31 million (including the favorable resolution of a $6 million warranty issue provided for in 2003), the $9 million benefit from a favorable mix of commercial aircraft and the $5 million favorable impact of a nonrecurring 2003 charge related to a recall, inspection and customer care program at the aircraft engine business, partially offset by higher engineering expenses of $28 million. Profit in the U.S. Government business decreased primarily due to the $20 million impact of lower V 22 revenue, an $11 million settlement with the U.S. Government and lower volume of training aircraft of $11 million, partially offset by the $10 million impact of higher volume of air launched weapons. Segment profit in 2003 was $65 million greater than in 2002 primarily because 2002 included $31 million of costs related to the recall, inspection and customer care programs at the aircraft engine business and higher profit of $22 million in the commercial helicopter business. The higher profit in the commercial helicopter business in 2003 was primarily due to lower receivable reserve provisions of $16 million and reduced pricing of $20 million in 2002 related to one commercial helicopter model. Bell Outlook Bells revenues are expected to increase about 7% in 2005 largely due to higher V 22 and ASV deliveries. V 22 revenue is expected to increase as deliveries of new production releases (recorded on an as delivered basis) are expected to more than offset lower engineering and development based revenues (recorded on a cost incurred basis). Margins are expected to remain relatively consistent as a result of ramp up costs for V 22 production. Cessna (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 2,473 $ 2,299 $ 3,175 Segment profit $ 267 $ 199 $ 376 Profit margin 11 % 9 % 12 % Backlog $ 5,352 $ 3,947 $ 4,474 Cessna is a leading manufacturer of general aviation aircraft and the largest manufacturer of light and mid sized business jets. Cessna provides dependable aircraft and premier service to corporate customers in over 75 countries. Cessna also participates in the fractional jet ownership business through its sales to a major fractional jet customer, as well as through CitationShares, Textrons joint venture with Tag Aviation USA, Inc. During 2004, the economy strengthened after a prolonged downturn, leading to a significant increase in business jet and single engine aircraft orders. At the same time, Cessna also realized the benefit of its continued strategy of investment in new product development, receiving FAA certification for the Citation XLS, Sovereign and CJ3 business jets and introducing upgrades to the CJ1 and CJ2, the CJ1+ and the CJ2+. Cessna Revenues The Cessna segments revenues increased $174 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due the $76 million increase from the consolidation of CitationShares, $39 million of higher pricing and a $12 million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances. Citation business revenue jet deliveries were 179 in 2004, compared with 194 jets in 2003. The Cessna segments revenues decreased $876 million in 2003, compared with 2002, due to lower Citation business jet volume (194 revenue jet deliveries in 2003, compared with 306 in 2002). Lower used aircraft volume of $87 million and lower Caravan volume of $32 million as a result of lower demand were essentially offset by higher spare parts and service volume of $48 million, higher pricing of $45 million related to the last remnants of introductory pricing on certain business jet models and a $27 million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances. Cessna Segment Profit Segment profit increased $68 million in 2004, compared with 2003, largely due to $85 million of improved cost performance, $39 million of higher pricing, $18 million of lower used aircraft valuation adjustments, a $12 million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and an $8 million benefit related to the expiration of prior year residual value guarantees, partially offset by 16 $70 million of inflation and the unfavorable impact of lower business jet volume and unfavorable mix of $20 million. The benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and valuation adjustments was primarily due to fewer trade ins and a stabilization in market values for used jets in 2004. Segment profit decreased $177 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to reduced margin of $305 million from lower sales volume and inflation of $67 million, partially offset by improved cost performance of $125 million and higher pricing of $45 million related to the last remnants of introductory pricing on certain business jet models and a $27 million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances. Cessna Outlook We expect Cessnas revenues to increase in 2005 due to higher sales of jets based on our current backlog. Margins are also expected to increase primarily as a result of the higher business jet volume. Cessna plans to continue its investment in new products such as the CJ1+, CJ2+ and Mustang, broadening its product line to take advantage of the improving business jet market. Fastening Systems (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 1,924 $ 1,737 $ 1,650 Segment profit $ 53 $ 66 $ 72 Profit margin 3 % 4 % 4 % Textron Fastening Systems is one of the worlds largest providers of integrated fastening systems solutions and offers a full range of fastening technologies, including fasteners, engineered assemblies and automation equipment. Major markets served include aerospace, automotive, computer, construction, electronics, electrical equipment, industrial equipment, non automotive transportation, telecommunications and white good markets. These markets are highly competitive, and suppliers are often required to make price concessions to win new business and maintain existing customers. Consequently, significant cost reductions are required not only to offset inflation and price concessions, but also to improve margins. During 2004, an increase in the global demand for steel resulted in significantly higher prices for materials used in the manufacturing process at Fastening Systems, a major supplier of steel fasteners. As a result, Fastening Systems took action to raise prices and impose surcharges on its steel products to mitigate the impact of higher raw material costs. There has been about a six month lag between the increases in cost and full implementation of the new customer pricing programs. These price increases for steel have been partially offset by price concessions required to win new business and retain existing customers. Fastening Systems Revenues The Fastening Systems segments revenues increased $187 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange of $116 million, higher volume of $57 million, largely due to improvements in many of its end markets, and $20 million of higher pricing. The Fastening Systems segments revenues increased $87 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of $128 million, reflecting a weak U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher pricing concessions of $13 million in 2003 and lower volume primarily in the European industrial markets. Fastening Systems Segment Profit Segment profit decreased $13 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to inflation of $88 million, partially offset by improved cost performance of $35 million, pricing of $20 million, the impact of the higher sales volume of $10 million and favorable foreign exchange of $10 million. Inflation includes $62 million of higher steel prices, which were partially offset by $35 million in price increases and surcharges to customers. Segment profit in 2003 remained relatively flat with some deterioration, compared with 2002, reflecting the soft demand for the segments products and higher pricing concessions of $13 million. Fastening Systems Outlook We expect revenues at Fastening Systems will remain relatively flat in 2005 with a slight improvement in profit margin as we begin to realize the full benefit of our substantially completed restructuring program and other process improvements. Industrial (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 3,046 $ 2,836 $ 2,627 Segment profit $ 194 $ 150 $ 169 Profit margin 6 % 5 % 6 % 17 The Industrial segment is composed of five businesses, including E Z GO, Jacobsen, Kautex, Greenlee and Fluid & Power. Through these businesses, the segment provides its customers with innovative solutions and services, including golf cars and turf care equipment, plastic fuel systems, wire and cable installation equipment, and industrial pumps and gears. These markets are highly competitive and price sensitive. Consequently, significant cost reductions are required not only to offset inflation and price concessions but also to improve margins. Industrial Revenues The Industrial segments revenues increased $210 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of $167 million and higher sales volume of $61 million, partially offset by $17 million related to the divestiture of a non core product line during the second quarter of 2004. The higher sales volume primarily reflects an increase of $44 million at Kautex, largely due to new product launches and growth in its international markets, and to a lesser degree increases of $18 million and $12 million at E Z GO and Jacobsen, respectively. The Industrial segments revenues increased $209 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of $185 million and higher sales volume of $131 million at Kautex as a result of new product launches and a continued strong automotive market. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of $123 million at E Z GO and Jacobsen, reflecting reduced demand that was largely attributable to a depressed golf market. Industrial Segment Profit Segment profit increased $44 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to $92 million of improved cost performance, improved credit performance of $16 million, the favorable foreign exchange impact of $13 million, the $10 million impact of higher volume and lower fair market value adjustments of $8 million for used golf cars. These increases were partially offset by inflation of $59 million and lower profit of $24 million at a North American Kautex plant due to increased costs from manufacturing inefficiencies. Segment profit decreased $19 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to lower profit of $52 million at E Z GO and Jacobsen, due to lower sales as a result of the depressed golf market, the impact of adjusting production schedules to the lower demand and $12 million in higher bad debt provisions as a result of a financially weakened customer base. This decrease was partially offset by $33 million related to improved results in each of the other businesses primarily as a result of improved cost performance. Industrial Outlook Industrial revenues are expected to remain flat in 2005, with slightly lower revenues at Kautex, as a result of model changeovers, expected to be offset with modest growth in the remaining businesses. Segment margins are forecasted to increase to about 7%, as the segment continues to realize the benefit of its substantially completed restructuring program and other process improvements. Finance (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 545 $ 572 $ 584 Segment profit $ 139 $ 122 $ 118 Profit margin 26 % 21 % 20 % The Finance segment is a diversified commercial finance business with core operations in aircraft finance, asset based lending, distribution finance, golf finance, resort finance and structured capital. Its financing activities are confined almost exclusively to secured lending and leasing to commercial markets. Within these core operations, this segment also provides financing programs for products manufactured by Textron. In 2004, management continued its focus on growing its core business while liquidating non core assets. Finance Revenues The Finance segments revenues decreased $27 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower finance charges and discounts of $35 million, largely due to the continued liquidation of non core assets resulting in lower average finance receivables of $269 million, and a reduction of discount earnings in the distribution finance business. The decrease was partially offset by higher securitization gains of $13 million, primarily due to improved yield, and $20 million from an increase in average finance receivables sold to the distribution finance revolving conduit, partially offset by a $6 million reduction in resort finance gains. 18 The Finance segments revenues decreased $12 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to lower finance charges and discounts of $9 million from lower average finance receivables and a decline in syndication income due to a nonrecurring gain in 2002 of $9 million on the sale of a franchise finance portfolio. Finance Segment Profit Segment profit increased $17 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to a $23 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, reflecting an improvement in portfolio quality, partially offset by lower net interest margin of $10 million. Segment profit increased $4 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a lower provision for loan losses of $30 million ($81 million in 2003 vs. $111 million in 2002), partially offset by higher operating expense of $26 million. The 27% decrease in the provision for loan losses reflects an improvement in portfolio quality as measured by improvements in nonperforming assets as discussed below and, to a lesser extent, declining portfolio growth. The higher operating expense includes $12 million in higher legal and collection expense primarily related to the continued resolution of nonperforming accounts and the accrual of settlement costs associated with litigation during 2003. Finance Portfolio Quality The following table presents information about the credit quality of the Finance segments portfolio: (In millions, except for ratios) 2004 2003 2002 Provision for loan losses $ 58 $ 81 $ 111 Nonperforming assets $ 140 $ 162 $ 214 Ratio of nonperforming assets to total finance assets 2.18 % 2.80 % 3.41 % Allowance for losses on finance receivables recorded on balance sheet $ 99 $ 119 $ 145 Ratio of allowance for losses on receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables 83.7 % 78.4 % 81.7 % Net charge offs $ 79 $ 117 $ 103 60+ days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables 1.47 % 2.39 % 2.86 % During the last two years, the Finance segment has experienced improvements in portfolio quality as indicated by improved credit quality measures and a lower provision for losses. The improvements in credit quality were evident through lower nonperforming asset levels and 60+ days contractual delinquency. Textron Finances nonperforming assets include nonaccrual accounts that are not guaranteed by Textron Manufacturing, for which interest has been suspended, and repossessed assets. Nonperforming assets for each of the last three year ends by business are as follows: (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Resort finance $ 53 $ 55 $ 45 Aircraft finance 12 26 34 Golf finance 26 22 15 Distribution finance 5 11 21 Asset based lending 7 6 13 Other 37 42 86 Total nonperforming assets $ 140 $ 162 $ 214 We believe that nonperforming assets will generally be in the range of 2% to 4% of finance assets depending on economic conditions. Textron Finance experienced significant improvement in total nonperforming assets with a $22 million decrease in 2004 and a $52 million decrease in 2003. The decrease in 2004 was primarily attributable to the core businesses, including $14 million in aircraft finance and $6 million in distribution finance, largely related to improved general economic conditions. Excluding an increase of $13 million in nonperforming assets related to one customer within its golf mortgage portfolio, the golf finance business experienced improvements of $7 million in its golf mortgage portfolio and $2 million in its golf equipment finance portfolio. The non core businesses within the other line continued to decrease with a $5 million reduction in telecommunications, $10 million in media finance and $7 million in other liquidating portfolios, partially offset by a $22 million increase in franchise finance primarily related to one customer. These non core businesses continue to compose a disproportionate amount of Textron Finances nonperforming assets accounting for 27% of total nonperforming assets, while composing only 7% of the total finance assets at January 1, 2005. Overall, we expect continued modest improvement as these portfolios liquidate. 19 Finance Outlook In 2005, we expect the Finance segments profit to increase primarily as a result of improved interest margin due to higher average finance receivables and lower relative borrowing costs.

This framework is designed to enhance Textrons borrowing power by separating the Finance segment. Textron Manufacturing consists of Textron Inc., the parent company, consolidated with the entities that operate in the Bell, Cessna, Fastening Systems and Industrial business segments, whose financial results are a reflection of the ability to manage and finance the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services. Textron Finance consists of Textrons wholly owned commercial finance subsidiary, Textron Financial Corporation, consolidated with its subsidiaries. The financial results of Textron Finance are a reflection of its ability to provide financial services in a competitive marketplace, at appropriate pricing, while managing the associated financial risks. The fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities result in different measures used by investors, rating agencies and analysts. A portion of Textron Finances business involves financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by Textron Manufacturings Bell, Cessna and Industrial segments. The cash flows related to these captive financing activities are reflected as operating activities (by Textron Manufacturing) and as investing activities (by Textron Finance) based on each groups operations. These captive financing transactions have been eliminated and cash from customers or from securitizations is recognized in operating activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows when received. 20 Textron Inc. provides a support agreement to Textron Finance that requires Textron Inc. to maintain 100% ownership of Textron Finance. The agreement also requires Textron Finance to maintain fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders equity of no less than $200 million. Textron Finances bank agreements prohibit the termination of the support agreement. Textrons financial position continued to be strong at the end of 2004 and included cash and cash equivalents of $732 million, compared with $838 million at the end of 2003. During 2004, cash flows from operations were the primary source of funds for the operating needs, restructuring activities, dividends and capital expenditures. Management analyzes operating cash flows for Textron Manufacturing by tracking free cash flow, which is calculated using net cash provided by operating activities, adding back after tax cash used for restructuring activities and proceeds on the sale of fixed assets, then subtracting capital expenditures, including those financed with capital leases. Operating Cash Flows (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Consolidated $ 949 $ 985 $ 676 Textron Manufacturing $ 973 $ 691 $ 481 Textron Finance $ 161 $ 242 $ 198 On a consolidated basis, operating cash flows have remained fairly consistent over the past two years.Textron Manufacturings operating cash flows have increased significantly over the past two years, reflecting improved operating performance and enterprise management initiatives. The $282 million increase in Textron Manufacturings operating cash flows is largely due to a decrease in working capital of $205 million in 2004, compared with a $65 million increase in working capital in 2003. A significant portion of this decrease was due to an increase in customer deposits in the Bell and Cessna segments largely due to an increase in orders for jets and commercial helicopters. Textron Manufacturings operating cash flows include after tax cash used to finance Textrons restructuring program totaling $67 million in 2004, $54 million in 2003 and $57 million in 2002. Operating cash flows in 2003 included a $109 million tax refund received in 2003. Investing Cash Flows (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Consolidated $ (844 ) $ (65 ) $ (734 ) Textron Manufacturing $ (202 ) $ (210 ) $ 324 Textron Finance $ (756 ) $ 272 $ (1,008 ) On a consolidated basis, investing cash flows are largely driven by Textron Finance. Textron Finance increased its use of cash for investing activities primarily due to a $768 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of finance receivables and securitizations and a $227 million increase in finance receivable originations, net of repayments. The reduction in proceeds from receivable sales was largely attributable to the sale of a small ticket equipment portfolio in 2003 for $329 million, a $130 million increase in the utilization of the distribution finance conduit and franchise portfolio sales of $123 million in 2003. The significant increase in 2003 was primarily due to a $389 million decrease in finance receivable originations, net of repayments, $196 million in higher proceeds from finance receivable sales and a nonrecurring $510 million repayment in 2002 of an advance made to Textron Manufacturing. Excluding the nonrecurring repayment in 2002 of an advance of $510 million from Textron Finance, Textron Manufacturings use of cash for investing activities has been fairly consistent and is largely driven by capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for Textron Manufacturing totaled $334 million in 2004, $306 million in 2003 and $298 million in 2002, including expenditures purchased through capital leases of $44 million in 2004, $26 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002. Textron Finances investing activities include $892 million, $886 million and $969 million in non cash activity for finance receivables originated in connection with the sale of inventory in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash received from customers and securitizations related to the sale of inventory is also included within Textron Finances investing activities totaling $727 million, $972 million and $1,059 million, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Within the consolidated statement of cash flows these amounts have been eliminated from investing activities and are recorded as a net amount in operating cash flows under the caption Captive finance receivables, net. 21 Financing Cash Flows (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Consolidated $ (276 ) $ (746 ) $ 36 Textron Manufacturing $ (708 ) $ (469 ) $ (803 ) Textron Finance $ 361 $ (354 ) $ 786 On a consolidated basis, the changes in financing cash flows over the past few years are largely driven by changes in the cash flows for Textron Finance. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 at Textron Finance is primarily due to a net increase in commercial paper and other short term debt to fund asset growth. The cash used in 2003 primarily relates to the pay down of commercial paper and other short term debt from the proceeds received from finance receivable sales. In addition, in 2003, under new and existing shelf registration statements, Textron Finance issued $1.2 billion of term notes, primarily in U.S. and Canadian markets. In 2002, Textron Finance issued $2.0 billion of term notes to refinance maturing term debt and to repay the 2001 advance of $510 million from Textron Manufacturing. During 2004, Textron Manufacturing repaid a $300 million 6.375% note using cash and proceeds from commercial paper issuances. During 2003, Textron Manufacturing issued $250 million in term notes under Textron Inc.s existing shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and used the proceeds for the redemption of $500 million in mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in July 2003. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased $120 million to $187 million in 2004 as more options were exercised primarily due to the increasing stock price. Principal Payments and Retirements of Long Term Debt and Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Textron Manufacturing made principal payments of $362 million, $508 million and $544 million, respectively. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Textron Finance made principal payments on long term debt of $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. Stock Repurchases In October 2004, Textrons Board of Directors authorized a new 12 million share repurchase program. This program supercedes Textrons previous authorization, under which less than one million shares remained. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Textron repurchased approximately 6,396,000, 1,951,000 and 5,734,000 shares of common stock, respectively, under its Board authorized share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of $415 million, $66 million and $248 million, respectively. Dividends In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized a $0.10 per share increase in Textrons annualized common stock dividend, from $1.30 per share to $1.40 per share. The first increased dividend payment was paid on January 3, 2005 to holders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2004, resulting in an annual dividend per common share of $1.325 in 2004, compared with $1.30 each in 2003 and 2002. Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $135 million, $222 million and $182 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2003 payments include an additional payment made for the fourth quarter dividend, which is typically paid in the following year. Discontinued Operations Cash Flows Net cash provided by discontinued operations for Textron Manufacturing includes the OmniQuip and InteSys businesses and totaled $32 million in 2004, $158 million in 2003 and $20 million in 2002. In 2003, Textron Manufacturing received a $90 million cash payment upon the sale of its remaining OmniQuip business and a $108 million tax refund related to the sale of the Snorkel product line and the capital stock of the OmniQuip Textron Inc. holding company. Net cash provided by discontinued operations for Textron Finance includes the small business finance operation and totaled $175 million in 2003 and $27 million in 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Textron Finance sold substantially all of its small business direct portfolio for $421 million in cash. Capital Resources Textron Manufacturings debt (net of cash) to total capital ratio as of January 1, 2005 was 25%, compared with 30% at January 3, 2004. Textron Manufacturing has established a long term debt to capital ratio target in the mid thirties. Consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community, leverage of the manufacturing operations excludes the debt of Textron Finance. In turn, Textron Finance limits its borrowings to an amount, taking into account the risk profile of its assets, consistent with a single A credit rating. Surplus capital of Textron Finance is returned to Textron Inc. 22 Borrowings have historically been a secondary source of funds for Textron Manufacturing and, along with the collection of finance receivables, are a primary source of funds for Textron Finance. Both Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs. Our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flow and satisfy certain financial ratios. Since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost, we target a long term A rating from the independent debt rating agencies. As of January 1, 2005, our credit ratings are as follows: Fitch Moodys Standard & Poors Long term: Textron Manufacturing A A3 A Textron Finance A A3 A Short term: Textron Manufacturing F2 P2 A2 Textron Finance F2 P2 A2 For liquidity purposes, Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance have a policy of maintaining sufficient unused lines of credit to support their outstanding commercial paper. None of these lines of credit were used at January 1, 2005 or at January 3, 2004. Textron Manufacturing has primary revolving credit facilities of $1.25 billion, of which $1.0 billion will expire in 2007 and $0.25 billion will expire in March 2005. Textron Manufacturings credit facilities permit Textron Finance to borrow under those facilities. Textron Finance also has bank lines of credit of $1.5 billion, of which $500 million expires in July 2005 and $1.0 billion expires in 2008. The facilities that expire in 2005 both include one year term out options that effectively extend their expirations into 2006. At January 1, 2005, the lines of credit not reserved as support for commercial paper and letters of credit were $1.2 billion for Textron Manufacturing and $187 million for Textron Finance. Under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Textron Finance may issue public debt securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of $4.0 billion. Under this registration statement, Textron Finance issued $370 million of term notes during 2004. The proceeds from these issuances were used to refinance maturing debt. At January 1, 2005, Textron Finance had $3.3 billion available under this registration statement. Under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that became effective on August 4, 2004, Textron Manufacturing may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of $2.0 billion. At January 1, 2005, Textron Manufacturing had $2.0 billion available under this registration statement. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Textron Manufacturings known contractual obligations to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of January 1, 2005, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied: Payment Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years 5 Years Total Textron Manufacturing: Liabilities reflected in balance sheet: Long term debt $ 427 $ 4 $ 34 $ 346 $ $ 848 $ 1,659 Capital lease obligations 6 4 3 2 3 114 132 Pension benefits for unfunded plans 15 14 13 14 13 150 219 Postretirement benefits other than pensions 60 61 59 58 54 455 747 Other long term liabilities 135 74 51 33 30 246 569 Liabilities not reflected in balance sheet: Operating leases 70 55 37 28 28 127 345 Purchase obligations 1,412 132 35 7 12 1,598 Total Textron Manufacturing $ 2,125 $ 344 $ 232 $ 488 $ 128 $ 1,952 $ 5,269 Long term debt and capital lease obligations included in the table above do not include interest payments. 23 Textron maintains defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in the table above are discounted estimated benefit payments to be made by Textron related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. Textron also expects to make contributions to its funded pension plans in the range of $30 million to $35 million per year over the next five years, which are not reflected in this table. Other long term liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2005 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. Timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience. Operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases. Purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which Textron is committed to purchase goods and services as of January 1, 2005. Textrons ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts, the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the U.S. Government under normal termination clauses. Effective January 2, 2005, Textron engaged a third party service provider to assume oversight of its information technology infrastructure, including maintenance, operational oversight and purchases of hardware (the IT Contract). The IT Contract covers a ten year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications. Textron retains the right to approve significant design, equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider. Textron has the ability to terminate the IT Contract prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed $70 million in 2005. The following table summarizes Textron Finances known contractual obligations to make future payments. Due to the nature of finance companies, Textron Finance also has contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future. Textron Finance generally borrows funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables. The contractual payments and receipts as of January 1, 2005 are detailed below: Payment Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years 5 Years Total Textron Finance: Contractual payments: Commercial paper and other short term debt $ 1,307 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,307 Term debt 656 985 983 42 542 268 3,476 Operating leases 5 5 4 4 2 3 23 Total contractual payments 1,968 990 987 46 544 271 4,806 Contractual receipts: Finance receivables 2,303 683 526 516 397 1,412 5,837 Operating leases 27 19 16 12 10 24 108 Total contractual receipts 2,330 702 542 528 407 1,436 5,945 Cash 127 127 Total cash and contractual receipts 2,457 702 542 528 407 1,436 6,072 Net cash and contractual receipts (payments) $ 489 $ (288 ) $ (445 ) $ 482 $ (137 ) $ 1,165 $ 1,266 Cumulative net cash and contractual receipts (payments) $ 489 $ 201 $ (244 ) $ 238 $ 101 $ 1,266 Finance receivables are based on contractual cash flows. These amounts could differ due to prepayments, charge offs and other factors. Contractual receipts and payments exclude finance charges and discounts from receivables, debt interest payments, proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items. 24 As shown in the preceding table, cash collections from finance assets are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities. At January 1, 2005, Textron Finance had $2.0 billion in debt and $399 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next twelve months. At January 1, 2005, Textron Finance had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under $1.0 billion of committed revolving lines of credit, compared with $1.1 billion at January 3, 2004. The decrease is largely related to the continued liquidation of the non core syndicated bank loan portfolio in 2004. Since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Textron has certain ventures where we have guaranteed debt up to an aggregate amount of approximately $18 million. Textron also has other guarantee arrangements as more fully discussed in Notes 4 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Bell Helicopter has partnered with The Boeing Company in the development of the V 22 tiltrotor, with Agusta Aerospace Corporation in the development of the AB139 and BA609, and with AgustaWestland North America Inc. (AWNA) in the development of the US101. These agreements enable us to share expertise and costs, and ultimately the profits, with our partners. Bell and AWNA formed the AgustaWestlandBell Limited Liability Company (AWB LLC) for the joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product support of the US101 Helicopter. Lockheed Martin, with AWB LLC as its principal subcontractor, has been selected to design, develop, manufacture and support the Presidential helicopter for the U.S. Marine Corps Marine 1 Helicopter Squadron (VXX) Program. Bell Helicopter has guaranteed to Lockheed Martin 49% of the performance of AWB LLC under subcontracts received by AWB LLC from Lockheed Martin as more fully discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Textron Manufacturing enters into a forward contract in Textron common stock on an annual basis. The contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock based incentive compensation indexed to Textron stock. The forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counter parties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing Textron common stock price. As of January 1, 2005, the contract was for approximately 2 million shares with a strike price of $57.51. The market price of the stock was $73.80 at January 1, 2005, resulting in a receivable of $31 million, compared with a receivable of $25 million at January 3, 2004. Textron Finance sells finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and whole loan sales. As a result of these transactions, finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet, and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels. Despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position, Textron Finance generally retains a subordinate interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations, which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments. These retained interests are more fully discussed in the securitizations section of Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Textron Finance utilizes these off balance sheet financing arrangements (primarily asset backed securitizations) to further diversify funding alternatives. These arrangements are an important source of funding that provided net proceeds from continuing operations of $394 million and $765 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Textron Finance has used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper. Whole loan finance receivable sales in which Textron Finance maintains a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred. Limited credit enhancement is typically provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and, to a lesser extent, prepayment risk. Textron Finance has a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease rental streams in 2003 and 2001. The maximum liability at January 1, 2005 was $42 million, and in the event Textron Finances credit rating falls below BBB, it is required to pledge a related pool of equipment residuals that amount to $10 million. Textron Finance has valued this contingent liability based on assumptions for annual credit losses and prepayment rates of 0.25% and 7.50%, respectively. An instantaneous 20% adverse change in these rates would have an insignificant impact on the valuation of this contingent liability. Termination of Textron Finances off balance sheet financing arrangements would significantly reduce its short term funding alternatives. While these arrangements do not contain provisions that require Textron Finance to repurchase significant balances of receivables previously sold, there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future. Potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality, downgrades in Textron Finances debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements. Textron Finance does not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on its liquidity or income from continuing operations. 25 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of Textrons financial condition and results of operations, and that require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties, are listed below. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which includes other significant accounting policies. Receivable and Inventory Reserves We evaluate the collectibility of our commercial and finance receivables based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its short term financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit scores, geographic economic conditions, etc.), we record a specific reserve for bad debts for amounts we estimate to be potentially uncollectible. Receivables are charged off when deemed uncollectible. For homogeneous loan pools and all other receivables, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on current delinquencies, the characteristics of the existing accounts, historical loss experience, the value of underlying collateral, and general economic conditions and trends. Finance receivables are written down to the fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the collateral is repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months, unless we deem the receivable collectible. Reserves on certain finance receivables are determined using estimates of related collateral values based on historical recovery rates and current market conditions. Management reviews the market conditions for used equipment and aircraft inventories on a periodic basis. A deterioration in market conditions resulting in lower recovery rates would result in lower estimated collateral values, increasing the amount of reserves required on related receivables and used inventories on hand. Based on current market conditions and recovery rates, we believe our reserves are adequate as of January 1, 2005. Long Term Contracts We recognize revenue and profit as work on certain government long term engineering, development and production contracts progresses using the contract method of accounting, which relies on estimates of the total contract cost and revenue. Estimated contract cost and revenue are based on current contract specifications, expected engineering requirements and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries. Contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years, and the estimation of these costs requires substantial judgments. The cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change. Adjustments to projected costs are recognized in net earnings when determinable. Favorable changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition, while unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized earnings. Any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified. Earnings on long term contracts could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to income if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones. Goodwill We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired. We completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2004 using the estimates from our long term strategic plans. No adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts. The revenue growth rates included in the plans are managements best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions. If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. 26 Securitized Transactions Securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts. While the assets sold are no longer on our balance sheet, our retained interests are included in other assets. We may retain an interest in the transferred assets in the form of interest only securities, subordinated certificates, cash reserve accounts, and servicing rights and obligations. Our retained interests are subordinate to other investors interests in the securitizations. Generally, we do not provide legal recourse to third party investors that purchase interests in our securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained interest only securities, subordinated certificates and cash reserve accounts. However, Textron Manufacturing has provided a guarantee on a limited basis to a certain securitization trust sponsored by a third party financial institution that purchases timeshare note receivables from Textron Finance, as discussed more fully in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future cash flows expected using our best estimates of credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. These assumptions are reviewed each quarter, and the retained interests are written down when the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on revised estimates and the decline is estimated to be other than temporary. Based on our sensitivity analysis, as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, a 20% adverse change in either the prepayment speed, expected credit losses or the residual cash flows discount rate would not result in a material charge to income. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors. Other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increases. To determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. For 2004, we have reduced the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense to 8.65% from 8.71% in 2003. While historical rates have exceeded 8.75%, the expected long term rate of return assumption was lowered to reflect the generally expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets. Our qualified domestic plans compose over 80% of our total pension obligations. In 2004, the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans was 8.9%. A 50 basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a $20 million increase in pension expense. The discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits and changes as long term interest rates change. A lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. In 2004, we decreased our weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense to 6.14% in 2004 from 6.61% in 2003. For our qualified domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 6.25% for 2004. A 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a $10 million increase in pension expense. The estimated accumulated benefit obligations for the pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at January 1, 2005 as a result of a reduction in the discount rate and changes in foreign exchange rates which more than offset the favorable impact of strong pension asset returns and the contributions made by us during 2004. Accordingly, we recorded a non cash adjustment to shareholders equity for the minimum pension liability of $131 million, net of income taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2004. The trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The 2004 healthcare cost trend rate, which is the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, was 11%. This rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2009 and then remain at that level. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to 27 reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognized future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive loss, as appropriate. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. The valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123) and supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123 R requires companies to measure compensation costs for share based payments to employees, including stock options, at fair value and expense such compensation over the service period beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Textron is required to adopt SFAS 123 R in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Under SFAS 123 R, companies must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Management is evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123 R. Management believes the impact of adopting SFAS 123 Rwill result in additional expense of approximately $15 million, net of income taxes, for 2005. This estimate is subject to change based on a number of factors, including the actual number of stock option awards granted, changes in assumptions underlying the option value estimates, such as the risk free interest rate, and tax deductions for employee disqualifying dispositions, if any. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risks Textrons financial results are affected by changes in U.S. and foreign interest rates. As part of managing this risk, Textron enters into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa. The overall objective of Textrons interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt. Textrons mix of floating and fixed rate debt is continuously monitored by management and is adjusted, as necessary, based on evaluation of internal and external factors. The difference between the rates Textron Manufacturing received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2004, 2003 or 2002. Within its Finance segment, Textrons strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities limits its risk to changes in interest rates. This strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements. At January 1, 2005, floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were $421 million, net of $2.0 billion of interest rate exchange agreements on fixed rate long term debt and $168 million of interest rate exchange agreements on fixed rate finance receivables. For Textron Finance, interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the effect of decreasing interest expense by $40 million, $43 million and $20 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 28 Foreign Exchange Risks Textrons financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold. For 2004, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2003 increased revenues by approximately $287 million (2.9%) and increased segment profit by approximately $27 million (3.5%). Textron Manufacturing manages its exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency and, as such, certain exposures are naturally offset. During 2004, Textron Manufacturing primarily used borrowings denominated in Euro and British Pound Sterling for these purposes. In addition, as part of managing its foreign currency transaction exposures, Textron Manufacturing enters into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts. These contracts are generally used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately $493 million at the end of 2004 and $519 million at the end of 2003. Quantitative Risk Measures Textron utilizes a sensitivity analysis to quantify the market risk inherent in its financial instruments. Financial instruments held by Textron that are subject to market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk) include finance receivables (excluding lease receivables), debt (excluding lease obligations), interest rate exchange agreements, foreign exchange contracts, marketable equity securities and marketable security price forward contracts. Presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of Textrons financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading at year end. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments at year end assuming a 10% decrease in interest rates, a 10% strengthening in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and a 10% decrease in the quoted market prices of applicable marketable equity securities. The estimated fair value of the financial instruments was determined by discounted cash flow analysis and by independent investment bankers. This sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future. 2004 2003 (In millions) Carrying Value* Fair Value* Sensitivity of Fair Value to a 10% change Carrying Value* Fair Value* Sensitivity of Fair Value to a 10% change Interest Rate Risk Textron Manufacturing: Debt $ (1,791 ) $ (1,902 ) $ (34 ) $ (2,027 ) $ (2,177 ) $ (38 ) Interest rate exchanges (2 ) (2 ) 4 (1 ) (1 ) 5 Textron Finance: Finance receivables 4,888 4,842 42 4,313 4,274 43 Interest rate exchanges receivables 12 12 4 (15 ) (15 ) (6 ) Debt (4,783 ) (4,864 ) (66 ) (4,407 ) (4,552 ) (48 ) Interest rate exchanges debt 3 3 10 22 22 7 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Textron Manufacturing: Debt (779 ) (817 ) (82 ) (683 ) (751 ) (75 ) Foreign currency exchange contracts 34 34 36 20 20 48 Equity Price Risk Textron Manufacturing: Available for sale securities 24 24 (2 ) Marketable security price forward contracts 31 31 (14 ) 25 25 (12 ) * Asset or (liability) 29
