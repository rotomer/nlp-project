Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview Textron Inc. is a multi industry company that leverages its global network of businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services in four business segments: Bell, Cessna, Industrial and Finance. Textron is known around the world for its powerful brands spanning the business jet, aerospace and defense, plastic fuel systems, golf car and turf care markets, among others. The global economy continued to grow in most of our major markets in 2005, despite early weakness in some regions, including parts of Europe. The U.S. economy, in particular, proved resilient in the face of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Overall capital spending continued to grow at a steady and sustainable rate. Our companys performance is strongly related to this key economic factor, which reflects investments in longer lasting items such as equipment, facilities and vehicles. We had strong sales in 2005 particularly in our aerospace and defense businesses. We were able to deliver exceptional organic growth (gains from existing business, excluding the effects of acquisitions and other changes) of 19%, which is the result of our commitment to bringing new products and services to our customers. Orders were strong, most notably at Bell, where a steady flow of military orders resulted from continued spending in the defense sector and we received robust orders in our commercial helicopter business. Cessna also saw a significant increase in new business jet orders as a result of strength in the aircraft sector and the popularity of its new model introductions, and our Finance segment experienced significant improvement in its portfolio credit quality with fewer charge offs and a decrease in nonperforming assets. However, Industrial volumes were down slightly from 2004 largely due to a downturn in the North American automotive industry. While we were impacted by inflation and higher pension costs in 2005, we were able to absorb the impact of these factors primarily as a result of the increased volumes and the benefit of our transformation strategy to reduce costs, introduce new products and enhance our portfolio of businesses. We will continue to execute our transformation strategy and position Textron to take advantage of the improved economic conditions. To strengthen our overall position in our markets, we have continued to improve upon our portfolio of businesses. During 2005, we sold our interest in the Model AB139 helicopter program to Agusta, our partner in the BAAC venture. We also purchased US Helicopter to increase Bells ability to provide after sales service, bought out Kautexs Japanese joint venture partner to take advantage of a rapidly growing market, and set up a new joint venture with a German company, Rothenberger AG, to expand our presence in North American plumbing tools. In December 2005, our Board of Directors authorized managements plan for the divestiture of our Textron Fastening Systems business. With this approval, we have committed to actively market this business and anticipate no significant changes to the approved plan and the completion of the sale within the next twelve months. As a result, this business was reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2005. Consolidated Results of Operations 2005 Revenues $10.0 Billion 2005 Segment Profit* $1.1 Billion * Segment profit represents the measurement used by Textron to evaluate performance for decision making purposes. Segment profit for manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses, special charges, and gains and losses from the disposition of significant business units. The measurement for the Finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges. Revenues Revenues increased $1.7 billion in 2005 primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of $1.3 billion, higher pricing of $159 million, the additional revenue of $115 million from acquisitions and higher revenue in the Finance segment of $83 million. Revenues increased $263 million in 2004 primarily due to favorable foreign exchange of $167 million, the additional revenue of $76 million from the consolidation of CitationShares, higher manufacturing volume of $31 million and higher pricing of $30 million, partially offset by lower Finance revenues of $27 million. 15 Segment Profit Segment profit increased $296 million in 2005 primarily due to higher sales volume of $319 million, higher pricing of $159 million and higher profit in the Finance segment of $26 million. These increases were partially offset by inflation of $227 million. Segment profit increased $145 million in 2004 primarily due to $242 million in cost reduction initiatives, a $50 million benefit from restructuring activities and $30 million of higher pricing. These increases were partially offset by inflation of $167 million. Special Charges Special charges are summarized below: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Restructuring $ 6 $ 71 $ 62 C&A related charges 112 Gain on sale of C&A common stock (12 ) Unamortized issuance costs on preferred securities 15 Total special charges $ 118 $ 59 $ 77 Restructuring Program Textron substantially completed its company wide restructuring program at the end of 2005. Textron approved and committed to a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2000 to improve returns at core businesses and to complete the integration of certain acquisitions. This program was expanded in 2001 and in 2002 as part of Textrons strategic effort to improve operating efficiencies. Textrons restructuring program included corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions, consolidation of facilities, rationalization of certain product lines, outsourcing of non core production activity, the divestiture of non core businesses and the streamlining of sales and administrative overhead. Under this program, Textron reduced its workforce by approximately 8,000 employees from continuing operations, representing approximately 19% of its global workforce since the program was first announced, and has closed 85 facilities. As of December 31, 2005, Textron had incurred total program costs of $306 million, which is composed of $164 million in severance costs, $44 million in contract termination costs, $34 million in asset impairment charges (net of gains on the sale of fixed assets) and $64 million in other associated costs. Total program costs incurred by segment include $219 million in the Industrial segment, $38 million in the Cessna segment, $29 million in the Bell segment, $9 million in the Finance segment and $11 million at Corporate. Other Charges (Gain) Textron records any charges incurred or gains realized in connection with the 2001 disposition of the Automotive Trim business (Trim) as Special Charges. In connection with this disposition of Trim to subsidiaries of Collins & Aikman Corporation (C&A), Textron Finance has recourse to Textron Manufacturing for equipment leases with the subsidiaries. The outstanding balance on these leases totaled approximately $70 million at December 31, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the lease term for these leases expired and C&A failed to make one of its lease payments. While Textron Finance is currently in negotiations with C&A to renew these leases, Textron Manufacturing recorded an additional reserve of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 based on uncertainties related to these leases. In addition to the Textron Finance equipment leases, certain operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of C&A upon the sale of Trim. As discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Textron has guaranteed C&As payments under these operating leases and certain environmental matters. In May 2005, C&A and substantially all of its U.S. subsidiaries, including C&A Products Co. (C&A Products), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and in July 2005, C&As European subsidiaries filed a group wide administration order in the United Kingdom. These filings effectively reduced Textrons ability to seek recourse from C&A under the indemnity provisions of the purchase and sale agreement, should a default occur. Based on C&As recent failure to pay certain leases, as well as the negotiations entered into as part of the potential sale of C&As European operations, Textron recorded $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to cover its exposure under these leases, along with certain environmental and workers compensation matters. Textron also acquired preferred stock in C&A Products and C&A common stock in connection with the Trim disposition. Based on C&A Products filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and relevant market considerations, Textron recorded charges of approximately $91 million in 2005 to write off the remaining book value of its investment in the preferred stock. In 2004, Textron sold its remaining investment in the C&A common stock for cash proceeds of $34 million and recorded a pre tax gain of $12 million. 16 In 2003, Textron redeemed its 7.92% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2045. The debentures were held by Textrons wholly owned trust, and the proceeds from their redemption were used to redeem all of the $500 million Textron Capital I trust preferred securities. Upon the redemption, $15 million of unamortized issuance costs were written off and recorded in Special Charges. Corporate Expenses and Other, Net Corporate expenses and other, net increased $42 million in 2005, principally due to $16 million for higher compensation and pension costs, $9 million for corporate initiatives and $7 million for the corporate portion of share based compensation expense recorded under a newly adopted accounting standard. Corporate expenses and other, net increased $34 million in 2004 primarily due to $14 million of nonrecurring income in 2003, $6 million in higher premiums for Directors and Officers insurance, $5 million in funding to Textrons charitable trust and $4 million in higher executive compensation primarily related to improved operating results. The nonrecurring income in 2003 included $7 million related to an expired royalty agreement and $7 million in proceeds from life insurance policies. Income from Continuing Operations Fluctuations in income from continuing operations are primarily driven by segment profit changes as discussed above. In addition, Textron recorded certain items that affected the comparability of operating results in the last three years which are summarized in the table below: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Special charges $ 118 $ 59 $ 77 Gain on sale of businesses (15 ) 118 59 62 Income tax benefit on above items (41 ) (19 ) (16 ) $ 77 $ 40 $ 46 Gain on sale of businesses includes a gain of $15 million on the sale of Textrons remaining interest in a previously divested business. Share Based Compensation During the first quarter of 2005, Textron elected to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123 R), using the modified prospective method. The adoption resulted in recognition of share based compensation expense related primarily to the expensing of stock options in continuing operations of approximately $14 million ($10 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2005, including the net impact of the cumulative effect of adoption of approximately $1 million in the first quarter, and $2 million ($1 million after tax) in discontinued operations. Income Taxes A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is provided below: 2005 2004 2003 Federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from: Valuation allowance on contingent receipts 2.1 State income taxes 0.9 1.3 2.0 Special foreign dividend 0.1 2.1 Favorable tax settlements (3.0 ) Employee Stock Ownership Plan dividends (0.9 ) (1.2 ) (1.8 ) Foreign tax rate differential (5.0 ) (4.8 ) (3.4 ) Export sales benefit (1.1 ) (1.0 ) (1.3 ) Other, net (0.9 ) (0.8 ) (1.8 ) Effective income tax rate 30.2 % 30.6 % 25.7 % Discontinued Operations In December 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Textron Fastening Systems business. With this approval, we have committed to actively market this business and anticipate no significant changes to the approved plan and the completion of the sale within the next twelve months. 17 Discontinued operations include Textron Fastening Systems and the InteSys, OmniQuip and small business direct businesses as discontinued operations, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods presented in accordance with SFAS. No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these divestiture activities. Operating results of the discontinued businesses are as follows: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenue $ 1,936 $ 1,994 $ 1,973 (Loss) income from discontinued operations before special charges (388 ) 72 61 Special charges (11 ) (91 ) (111 ) Loss from discontinued operations (399 ) (19 ) (50 ) Income tax benefit 40 9 7 Operating loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (359 ) (10 ) (43 ) Gain on disposal, net of income taxes 46 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ (313 ) $ (10 ) $ (43 ) In 2005, the loss from discontinued operations includes a $335 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Textron Fastening Systems business. In addition, we recorded an after tax charge of approximately $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, which includes $37 million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and $2 million of tax charges, both related to the non U.S. based business, as well as $7 million related to curtailment losses for employee retirement plans. After these charges, management assessed the estimated fair value of the business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was required. In addition, approximately $6 million in after tax deal related costs primarily for professional services and advisory fees were incurred during the fourth quarter. In 2003, the loss from discontinued operations includes a $30 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge related to the OmniQuip business. In 2005, Textron recorded a net $46 million gain on disposal, primarily related to a tax benefit recorded upon the sale of InteSys. There was no gain or loss on the sale of OmniQuip and the small business direct businesses in 2003. Special charges represent restructuring costs incurred by Textron Fastening Systems, InteSys and OmniQuip in connection with the company wide restructuring program. Outlook We expect higher revenues in 2006 as a result of revenue increases at Bell, Cessna and Finance, while the Industrial businesses are expected to be down slightly. At Bell, revenues are expected to increase primarily due to higher commercial helicopter deliveries. At Cessna, we expect an increase in revenue due to higher sales of jets based on our current delivery schedule. Textrons commercial backlog from unaffiliated customers was $7.4 billion and $6.3 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is primarily related to Cessna. U.S. Government backlog was $3.3 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004, which was substantially all in the Bell segment. See Backlog in Item 1. Business of Textron on page 6 for more information. Segment Analysis Bell (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 2,881 $ 2,254 $ 2,348 Segment profit $ 368 $ 250 $ 234 Profit margin 13 % 11 % 10 % Backlog at Bell Helicopter $ 2,812 $ 2,842 $ 1,438 18 The Bell segment is a supplier of aircraft and weapon systems providing advanced product and service solutions to both military and commercial customers. Bell Helicopter is a leading manufacturer of military helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Government and commercial helicopters for corporate, offshore petroleum exploration and development, utility, charter, police, fire, rescue and emergency medical customers. Textron Systems is a primary supplier to the defense, aerospace and general aviation markets. Bell Helicopter participates in several major programs with the U.S. Government. In association with The Boeing Company, Bell Helicopter is the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft the V 22. The U.S. Government has issued contracts for 83 production V 22 aircraft with a total requirement of 458 aircraft. In September 2005, Bell received authorization to proceed to full rate production of the V 22. Bell Helicopter is nearing completion of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the H 1 Upgrade Program for the U.S. Marine Corps. This program will produce an advanced attack and a utility model helicopter, the AH 1Z and UH 1Y, respectively. The Operational Evaluation for this program is planned to begin shortly after the delivery of the remaining two aircraft in 2006. The U.S. Government has also issued contracts for the production of ten UH 1Y aircraft and six AH 1Z aircraft through Low Rate Initial Production. A contract for an additional lot, along with a priced option for another lot, is planned to be exercised in the second quarter of 2006. Additionally, Bell was awarded a contract for System Development and Demonstration of the Armys Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) with an expected requirement of 368 aircraft. Bell will also participate in the production of the VH 71 Presidential helicopter fleet through AWB LLC. During 2005, Bell Helicopters commercial business gained momentum with an increase in orders and deliveries. Bell continued to invest in commercial programs as evidenced by the significant progress made on the 429 Global Ranger and other program upgrades in response to customer requests to improve speed, lower operating costs and reduce noise. Textron Systems principal strategy and focus is to address the emphasis being placed by the U.S. Department of Defense on network centric warfare and the leveraging of advances in information technology by focusing on the development and production of advanced weapon systems. Additionally, Textron Systems has received orders to deliver more than 1,100 armored security vehicles (ASV). Currently, production capacity is ramping up to meet these deliveries in spite of the disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina. Bell Revenues U.S. Government Business U.S. Government revenues increased $491 million in 2005 primarily due to higher revenue of $288 million from the V 22 program, higher ASV volume of $61 million, the benefit of $36 million from the US Helicopter acquisition, higher military spares volume of $32 million and increased sales of $20 million for air launched weapons. Additionally, Bell recognized $21 million from the new ARH contract. U.S. Government revenues decreased $166 million in 2004 largely due to lower revenue of $243 million on the V 22 program primarily as a result of lower effort on production lots three through six as these contracts neared completion and a decrease in development activities. Lower sales of $30 million related to the completion of a contract for training aircraft in 2003 and an $11 million reduction in revenue, related to a final agreement with the U.S. Government to settle an overhead cost rate matter, also contributed to the revenue decrease. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by $34 million of higher military spares volume, increased sales of $34 million for air launched weapons and higher H 1 revenue of $34 million. Commercial Business Commercial revenues increased $136 million in 2005 primarily due to higher aircraft sales of $68 million, higher spares volume of $41 million and higher international military sales of $26 million due primarily to higher ASV deliveries to foreign customers of $58 million that were partially offset by lower helicopter volume of $32 million. Commercial revenues increased $72 million in 2004 primarily due to higher international military sales of $64 million, increased volume in the aircraft engine business of $18 million and higher spares volume of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by lower Huey II kit sales of $16 million and lower aircraft sales of $6 million. 19 Bell Segment Profit U.S. Government Business Profit in the U.S. Government business increased $33 million in 2005 principally due to higher V 22 volume of $26 million, reflecting the delivery of 12 aircraft from Lots 7 and 8, higher volume and improved performance of air launched weapons totaling $13 million, and increased ASV deliveries and improved performance of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by $18 million of costs associated with Hurricane Katrina. Profit in the U.S. Government business decreased $31 million in 2004 primarily due to the $20 million impact of lower V 22 revenue, an $11 million settlement with the U.S. Government and lower volume of training aircraft of $11 million, partially offset by the $10 million impact of higher volume of air launched weapons. Commercial Business Commercial profit increased $85 million in 2005 primarily due to the $30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Model AB139 helicopter program, the $29 million impact of higher international military volume and improved performance, higher spares volume of $22 million and a $13 million impact upon resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a prior year collaborative research and development sharing agreement. In addition, commercial profit reflected a $16 million decrease in net research and development, as higher gross research and development expenses of $28 million were more than offset by the commercial share of reimbursements related to risk sharing agreements from co development partners. These increases were partially offset by $28 million of higher selling and administrative expense and $18 million in additional reserves recorded by Lycoming related to the retirement program discussed below and crankshaft service bulletins discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Lycoming developed a plan to institute a retirement program for approximately 5,100 crankshafts, representing the remaining crankshafts manufactured by the former supplier using the same forging technique as the crankshafts covered by prior service bulletins. Accordingly, an additional reserve of $10 million was recorded in the fourth quarter to cover the expected cost of this planned retirement program. Commercial profit increased $47 million in 2004 primarily due to the $34 million impact of the higher international military sales, favorable cost performance in the helicopter business of $31 million (including the favorable resolution of a $6 million warranty issue provided for in 2003), the $9 million benefit from a favorable mix of aircraft and the $5 million favorable impact of a nonrecurring 2003 charge related to a recall, inspection and customer care program at the aircraft engine business, partially offset by higher engineering expenses of $28 million. Bell Outlook Bells revenues are expected to increase in 2006, while margins are expected to drop slightly due to the certain nonrecurring items that benefited the 2005 results. The U.S. Government business is expected to benefit from an increase in ASV volume as well as higher revenues from the ARH and VH 71 program contracts, which is expected to be partially offset by lower V 22 revenue based on scheduled deliveries. Higher revenue is expected in our commercial business largely due to increased deliveries in 2005. Cessna (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 3,480 $ 2,473 $ 2,299 Segment profit $ 457 $ 267 $ 199 Profit margin 13 % 11 % 9 % Backlog $ 6,342 $ 5,352 $ 3,947 Cessna Aircraft Company is the worlds largest manufacturer of general aviation aircraft, based on unit sales. Cessna currently has four major product lines: Citation business jets, single engine turboprop Caravans, Cessna single engine piston aircraft and aftermarket services. Cessna provides dependable aircraft and premier service to corporate customers in over 75 countries. Cessna also engages in the business jet fractional ownership market through CitationShares, a venture with TAG Aviation USA, Inc. During 2005, the economy continued to strengthen, leading to a significant increase in business jet and single engine aircraft orders. At the same time, Cessna also realized the benefit of its continued strategy of investment in new product development receiving FAA certification for the CJ1+ and the CJ2+ in 2005. Cessna also expects to receive certification of the Mustang in 2006. 20 Cessna Revenues The Cessna segments revenues increased $1.0 billion in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to higher Citation business jet volume of $737 million, higher pricing of $82 million and a benefit from the consolidation of CitationShares of $78 million. Citation business jet customer deliveries were 252 in 2005, compared with 179 jets in 2004. The Cessna segments revenues increased $174 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to the $76 million increase from the consolidation of CitationShares, $39 million of higher pricing and a $12 million benefit from lower to used aircraft overtrade allowances. Citation business revenue jet deliveries were 179 in 2004, compared with 194 jets in 2003. Cessna Segment Profit Segment profit increased $190 million in 2005, compared with 2004, largely due to the $229 million impact of higher volume across all product lines and $82 million of higher pricing, partially offset by $99 million of inflation. Additionally, Cessna was able to significantly improve profit margins and overcome the challenges associated with ramping up production and increasing research and development expenses. Segment profit increased $68 million in 2004, compared with 2003, largely due to $85 million of improved cost performance, $39 million of higher pricing, $18 million of lower used aircraft valuation adjustments, a $12 million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and an $8 million benefit related to the expiration of prior year residual value guarantees, partially offset by $70 million of inflation and the unfavorable impact of lower business jet volume and unfavorable mix of $20 million. The benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and valuation adjustments was primarily due to fewer trade ins and a stabilization in market values for used jets in 2004. Cessna Outlook Cessna anticipates another strong year of business jet deliveries in 2006 with total revenues expected to increase significantly. Indications are that 2007 will be a strong delivery year as well. In 2006, profit margins are expected to rise, primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Cessna will continue to invest in new products such as the Encore+ and the Mustang, broadening our product line to take advantage of the improving business jet market. Industrial (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 3,054 $ 3,046 $ 2,836 Segment profit $ 150 $ 194 $ 150 Profit margin 5 % 6 % 5 % The Industrial segment is composed of five businesses, including E Z GO, Jacobsen, Kautex, Greenlee and Fluid & Power. Through these businesses, the segment provides its customers with innovative solutions and services, including golf cars and turf care equipment, plastic fuel systems, wire and cable installation equipment, and industrial pumps and gears. These markets are highly competitive and price sensitive. Consequently, significant cost reductions are required not only to offset inflation and price concessions, primarily at Kautex, but also to improve margins. Industrial Revenues The Industrial segments revenues increased $8 million in 2005, compared with 2004, as higher pricing of $36 million and favorable foreign exchange of $31 million were largely offset by lower volume of $63 million. The lower sales volume primarily reflects decreases of $80 million at Kautex, largely due to product model changeovers, and $39 million at Jacobsen, primarily related to the strategic realignment of its North American commercial distribution network. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume of $31 million at Greenlee. The Industrial segments revenues increased $210 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of $167 million and higher sales volume of $61 million, partially offset by $17 million related to the divestiture of a non core product line during the second quarter of 2004. The higher sales volume primarily reflects an increase of $44 million at Kautex, largely due to new product launches and growth in its international markets, and to a lesser degree increases of $18 million and $12 million at E Z GO and Jacobsen, respectively. 21 Industrial Segment Profit Segment profit decreased $44 million in 2005, compared with 2004, largely due to inflation of $84 million and the impact of lower volume and an unfavorable mix of $21 million, partially offset by higher pricing of $36 million and improved cost performance of $24 million, primarily at Kautex. Segment profit increased $44 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to $92 million of improved cost performance, improved credit performance of $16 million, the favorable foreign exchange impact of $13 million, the $10 million impact of higher volume and lower fair market value adjustments of $8 million for used golf cars. These increases were partially offset by inflation of $59 million and lower profit of $24 million at a North American Kautex plant due to increased costs from manufacturing inefficiencies. Industrial Outlook Industrial revenues are expected to decrease in 2006, while segment margins are forecasted to improve slightly. The forecasted decrease in revenues reflects a decline at Kautex, primarily as a result of model changeovers and the divestiture of a product line in 2005, which is expected to be partially offset by growth at Greenlee and, to a lesser extent, increases for the remaining businesses. Finance (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 628 $ 545 $ 572 Segment profit $ 171 $ 139 $ 122 Profit margin 27 % 26 % 21 % The Finance segment is a diversified commercial finance business with core operations in aircraft finance, asset based lending, distribution finance, golf finance, resort finance and structured capital. Its financing activities are confined almost exclusively to secured lending and leasing to commercial markets. Within these core operations, this segment also provides financing programs for products manufactured by Textron. In 2005, management continued its focus on growing its core business while liquidating non core assets. Finance Revenues The Finance segments revenues increased $83 million in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher finance charges and discounts of $95 million, partially offset by lower prepayment income of $10 million. The increase in finance charges and discounts was largely due to a higher interest rate environment, which accounted for $98 million of the increase, and $62 million related to higher average finance receivables of $855 million, partially offset by lower relative receivable pricing of $65 million. The increase in average finance receivables was primarily related to growth in distribution, golf and aircraft finance and asset based lending, partially offset by reductions in the liquidating non core portfolios. The Finance segments revenues decreased $27 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower finance charges and discounts of $35 million, largely due to the continued liquidation of non core assets resulting in lower average finance receivables of $269 million, and a reduction of discount earnings in the distribution finance business. The decrease was partially offset by higher securitization gains of $13 million, primarily due to improved yield, and $20 million from an increase in average finance receivables sold to the distribution finance revolving conduit, partially offset by a $6 million reduction in resort finance gains. Finance Segment Profit Segment profit increased $32 million in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to a $29 million decrease in the provision for loan losses as a result of sustained improvements in portfolio quality, and an $18 million increase in net interest margin, which was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses of $15 million. The increase in net interest margin was primarily attributable to portfolio growth. Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to $9 million in higher variable compensation associated with portfolio growth and $5 million related to improved profitability and increased pension and benefits cost. Segment profit increased $17 million in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to a $23 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, reflecting an improvement in portfolio quality, partially offset by lower net interest margin of $10 million. 22 Finance Portfolio Quality The following table presents information about the credit quality of the Finance segments portfolio: (In millions, except for ratios) 2005 2004 2003 Provision for loan losses $ 29 $ 58 $ 81 Nonperforming assets $ 111 $ 140 $ 162 Ratio of nonperforming assets to total finance assets 1.53 % 2.18 % 2.80 % Allowance for losses on finance receivables recorded on balance sheet $ 96 $ 99 $ 119 Ratio of allowance for losses on receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables 108.6 % 83.7 % 78.4 % Net charge offs $ 32 $ 79 $ 117 60+ days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables 0.79 % 1.47 % 2.39 % The Finance segment has experienced significant improvements in portfolio quality over the past two years. The improvements in credit quality were evident through lower nonperforming asset levels and 60+ days contractual delinquency. Textron Finances nonperforming assets include nonaccrual accounts that are not guaranteed by Textron Manufacturing, for which interest has been suspended, and repossessed assets. Nonperforming assets for each of the last three year ends by business are as follows: (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Resort finance $ 31 $ 53 $ 55 Aircraft finance 14 12 26 Golf finance 13 26 22 Asset based lending 6 7 6 Distribution finance 2 5 11 Other 45 37 42 Total nonperforming assets $ 111 $ 140 $ 162 We believe that nonperforming assets will generally be in the range of 1% to 4% of finance assets depending on economic conditions. Textron Finance experienced significant improvement in total nonperforming assets with a $29 million decrease in 2005 and a $22 million decrease in 2004. The decrease in 2005 was primarily attributable to core businesses, including $22 million in resort finance and $13 million in golf finance, largely related to improved general economic conditions. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in liquidating portfolios. These non core businesses continue to compose a disproportionate amount of Textron Finances nonperforming assets accounting for 41% of total nonperforming assets while comprising less than 5% of the total finance assets at December 31, 2005. Finance Outlook In 2006, we expect the Finance segments profit to increase primarily as a result of improved net interest margin related to higher average finance receivables. 23 Special Charges by Segment Restructuring Expense Other Other Total Severance Contract Fixed Asset Associated Charges Special (In millions) Costs Terminations Impairments Costs Total (Gain) Charges 2005 Industrial $ 2 $ $ $ 4 $ 6 $ $ 6 Corporate 112 112 $ 2 $ $ $ 4 $ 6 $ 112 $ 118 2004 Bell $ $ $ (1 ) $ $ (1 ) $ $ (1 ) Industrial 28 37 1 6 72 72 Corporate (12 ) (12 ) $ 28 $ 37 $ $ 6 $ 71 $ (12 ) $ 59 2003 Bell $ 2 $ $ $ $ 2 $ $ 2 Cessna 8 1 9 9 Industrial 17 2 10 13 42 42 Finance 4 2 6 6 Corporate 3 3 15 18 $ 34 $ 2 $ 13 $ 13 $ 62 $ 15 $ 77 Liquidity and Capital Resources Textrons financings are conducted through two borrowing groups: Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance. This framework is designed to enhance Textrons borrowing power by separating the Finance segment. To support creditors in evaluating the separate borrowing groups, Textron presents separate balance sheets and statements of cash flows for each borrowing group. Textron Manufacturing consists of Textron Inc., the parent company, consolidated with the entities that operate in the Bell, Cessna and Industrial business segments, whose financial results are a reflection of the ability to manage and finance the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services. Textron Finance consists of Textrons wholly owned commercial finance subsidiary, Textron Financial Corporation, consolidated with its subsidiaries. The financial results of Textron Finance are a reflection of its ability to provide financial services in a competitive marketplace, at appropriate pricing, while managing the associated financial risks. The fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities result in different measures used by investors, rating agencies and analysts. A portion of Textron Finances business involves financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by Textron Manufacturing. The cash flows related to these captive financing activities are reflected as operating activities (by Textron Manufacturing) and as investing activities (by Textron Finance) based on each groups operations. These captive financing transactions have been eliminated, and cash from customers or from securitizations is recognized in operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows when received. Textron Inc. provides a support agreement to Textron Finance that requires Textron Inc. to maintain 100% ownership of Textron Finance. The agreement also requires Textron Finance to maintain fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders equity of no less than $200 million. Textron Finances bank agreements prohibit the termination of the support agreement. Textrons financial position continued to be strong at the end of 2005 and included aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $796 million, compared with $697 million at the end of 2004. During 2005, cash flows from operations were the primary source of funds for our operating needs, dividends and capital expenditures. Management analyzes operating cash flows for Textron Manufacturing by tracking free cash flow, which is calculated using net cash provided by operating activities, adding back proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment, then subtracting capital expenditures, including those financed with capital leases. 24 Operating Cash Flows of Continuing Operations (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Consolidated $ 952 $ 949 $ 846 Textron Manufacturing $ 894 $ 973 $ 552 Textron Finance $ 247 $ 161 $ 242 Operating cash flows on a consolidated basis have remained fairly consistent over the past few years. These consolidated cash flows exclude net captive financing activity (cash outflows from finance receivable originations, net of cash inflows from repayments, sales and securitizations) between Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance. In 2005 and 2004, this net captive financing activity increased Textron Manufacturings separate cash flows by $100 million and $165 million, respectively, while in 2003, cash flows were decreased by $86 million. Excluding these net changes from Textron Manufacturings cash flows, the increase in 2005 is largely due to increased income from operations, while the increase in 2004 is largely due to increased customer deposits in the Bell and Cessna segments resulting from an increase in orders for jets and commercial helicopters. Textron Manufacturings operating cash flows include after tax cash used to fund Textrons restructuring program of $12 million in 2005, $24 million in 2004 and $34 million in 2003. This program was substantially completed at the end of 2005 with forecasted cash payments in 2006 of approximately $4 million. Investing Cash Flows of Continuing Operations (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Consolidated $ (1,223 ) $ (800 ) $ (37 ) Textron Manufacturing $ (362 ) $ (158 ) $ (182 ) Textron Finance $ (950 ) $ (756 ) $ 272 Over the past three years, Textrons consolidated cash flows used in investing activities have been largely driven by an increase in net financing activities at Textron Finance. The 2005 and 2004 increases in cash used in investing activities in the consolidated cash flows reflect a higher use of cash resulting from the increase in finance receivable originations, net of cash collections from repayments, sales and securitizations, of $198 million and $744 million, respectively. Textron Manufacturing increased its use of cash for investing activities by $204 million in 2005 primarily with a $118 million increase in capital expenditures and a $38 million decrease in proceeds that were received in 2004 from the sale of C&A common stock. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily related to higher spending at the Bell segment in response to increased production demands. Capital expenditures for Textron Manufacturing totaled $371 million in 2005, $282 million in 2004 and $272 million in 2003, including expenditures purchased through capital leases of $15 million in 2005, $44 million in 2004 and $26 million in 2003. The separate borrowing group cash flows of Textron Finance reflect investing activities that include $824 million, $892 million and $886 million in non cash activity for finance receivables originated in connection with the sale of Textron Manufacturings inventory in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash received from customers and securitizations related to the sale of this inventory is also included within Textron Finances investing activities totaling $724 million, $727 million and $972 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows these amounts have been eliminated from investing activities and are recorded as a net amount in operating cash flows under the caption Captive Finance Receivables, Net. Financing Cash Flows of Continuing Operations (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Consolidated $ 284 $ (276 ) $ (735 ) Textron Manufacturing $ (403 ) $ (708 ) $ (456 ) Textron Finance $ 587 $ 361 $ (354 ) The 2005 increase in cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated cash flows was largely due to an increase in debt outstanding at both Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance. The increase in Textron Manufacturing principally reflects a retirement of debt of $300 million in 2004 and the issuance of $281 million in short term debt in 2005. Textron Finance increased its debt outstanding to fund asset growth. These 25 increases were partially offset by higher cash outflows from a $182 million increase in purchases of Textron common stock, $81 million in lower proceeds from employee stock ownership plans and a $54 million increase in dividend payments, primarily due to the timing of dividend payments with four quarters paid in 2005 and only three quarters paid in 2004. In 2004, the decrease in cash used by financing activities in the consolidated cash flows principally reflects a $715 million increase in cash provided by Textron Finance reflecting an increase in debt outstanding to fund asset growth, partially offset by a decrease at Textron Manufacturing largely due to higher cash outflows from a $351 million increase in purchases of Textron common stock. Principal Payments and Retirements of Long Term Debt In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron Manufacturing made principal payments of $417 million, $360 million and $503 million, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron Finance made principal payments on long term debt of $0.8 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Stock Repurchases On January 26, 2006, Textrons Board of Directors authorized a new 12 million share repurchase program. This program supercedes Textrons previous authorization, which was exhausted in January. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Textron repurchased approximately 8,035,000, 6,534,000 and 1,951,000 shares of common stock, respectively, under its Board authorized share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of $606 million, $425 million and $66 million, respectively. Dividends Textrons Board of Directors approved dividends of $1.40 per common share in 2005. On January 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $0.15 per share increase in Textrons annualized common stock dividend to $1.55 per share and, accordingly, a quarterly dividend of $0.3875 per share for holders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2006. Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $189 million, $135 million and $222 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2003 payments include an additional payment made for the fourth quarter dividend, which is typically paid in the following year. Discontinued Operations Cash Flows (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Operating activities $ 84 $ 1 $ 129 Investing activities $ 28 $ (18 ) $ 400 Financing activities $ (1 ) $ $ (99 ) Cash flows from discontinued operations include Textron Manufacturings Fastening Systems, OmniQuip and InteSys businesses, and Textron Finances small business finance operation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details concerning these dispositions. In 2003, cash provided by investing activities included the receipt of $421 million in cash upon the sale of substantially all of the small business finance operation, and $198 million in tax refunds and cash proceeds related to the sale of the OmniQuip business, partially offset by $197 million in finance receivable originations, net of repayments. Capital Resources Textron Manufacturings debt (net of cash) to capital ratio as of December 31, 2005 was 26%, compared with 25% at January 1, 2005. Textron Manufacturings gross debt to capital ratio as of December 31, 2005 was 37%, compared with 33% at January 1, 2005. Textron Manufacturing has established a gross debt to capital ratio target in the mid thirties. Consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community, leverage of the manufacturing operations excludes the debt of Textron Finance. In turn, Textron Finance limits its borrowings to an amount, taking into account the risk profile of its assets, consistent with a single A credit rating. Surplus capital of Textron Finance is returned to Textron Inc. Borrowings have historically been a secondary source of funds for Textron Manufacturing and, along with the collection of finance receivables, are a primary source of funds for Textron Finance. Both Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs. Our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flow and satisfy certain financial ratios. Since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost, we target a long term A rating from the independent debt rating agencies. In November 2005, Fitch upgraded its outlook for Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance to positive, while Moodys and Standard & Poors have assessed the outlook for both groups as stable. The credit ratings of these three debt ratings agencies are as follows: 26 Standard & Fitch Moodys Poors Long term: Textron Manufacturing A A3 A Textron Finance A A3 A Short term: Textron Manufacturing F2 P2 A2 Textron Finance F2 P2 A2 For liquidity purposes, Textron Manufacturing and Textron Finance have a policy of maintaining sufficient unused lines of credit to support their outstanding commercial paper. None of these lines of credit was used at December 31, 2005 or January 1, 2005. Textron Manufacturing has primary revolving credit facilities of $1.3 billion that expire in 2010. Textron Manufacturings credit facilities permit Textron Finance to borrow under those facilities. Textron Finance also has $1.5 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $500 million expires in July 2006 and $1.0 billion expires in 2010. Textron Finances facility that expires in 2006 includes a one year term out option that effectively extends its expiration into 2007. At December 31, 2005, the lines of credit not reserved as support for commercial paper and letters of credit were $1.2 billion for Textron Manufacturing and $300 million for Textron Finance. Under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Textron Finance may issue public debt securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of $4.0 billion. Under this registration statement, Textron Finance issued $1.4 billion of term debt and CAD 0.1 billion of term debt during 2005. The proceeds from these issuances were used to fund receivable growth and repay short term debt. At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had $1.8 billion available under this registration statement. Textron Manufacturing may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of $2.0 billion under its shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At December 31, 2005, Textron Manufacturing had $1.6 billion available under this registration statement. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Textron Manufacturings known contractual obligations to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2005, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied: Payment Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years 5 Years Total Textron Manufacturing: Liabilities reflected in balance sheet: Long term debt $ 272 $ 34 $ 341 $ $ 252 $ 913 $ 1,812 Capital lease obligations 3 3 2 3 2 109 122 Pension benefits for unfunded plans 13 12 14 15 15 142 211 Postretirement benefits other than pensions 67 66 64 61 58 503 819 Other long term liabilities 101 74 50 33 27 272 557 Liabilities not reflected in balance sheet: Operating leases 51 37 28 27 25 119 287 Purchase obligations 1,682 401 144 28 4 25 2,284 Total Textron Manufacturing $ 2,189 $ 627 $ 643 $ 167 $ 383 $ 2,083 $ 6,092 Long term debt and capital lease obligations included in the table above do not include interest payments. Operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases. Textron maintains defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in the table above are discounted estimated benefit payments to be made by Textron related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. Textron also expects to make contributions to its funded pension plans in the range of $25 million to $30 million per year over the next five years, which are not reflected in this table. 27 Other Long Term Liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. Timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience. Purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which Textron is committed to purchase goods and services as of December 31, 2005. Textrons ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts, the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the U.S. Government under normal termination clauses. Effective January 2, 2005, Textron engaged a third party service provider to assume oversight of its information technology infrastructure, including maintenance, operational oversight and purchases of hardware (the IT Contract). The IT Contract covers a 10 year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications. Textron retains the right to approve significant design, equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider. Textron has the ability to terminate the IT Contract prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed $63 million in 2006. In addition to the amounts included above, Textron Manufacturing has contractual obligations related to certain businesses reported as discontinued operations, primarily related to purchase obligations and post retirement benefit obligations other than pensions. These amounts are estimated to be paid as follows: $54 million in less than one year, $11 million in two years, $1 million in three years, $1 million in four years, $1 million in five years and $27 million in more than five years. The following table summarizes Textron Finances known contractual obligations to make future payments. Due to the nature of finance companies, Textron Finance also has contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future. Textron Finance generally borrows funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables. The contractual payments and receipts as of December 31, 2005 are detailed below: Payments/Receipts Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years 5 Years Total Textron Finance: Contractual payments: Commercial paper and other short term debt $ 1,200 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,200 Term debt 1,035 1,088 823 542 557 226 4,271 Operating leases 6 5 5 3 1 1 21 Total contractual payments 2,241 1,093 828 545 558 227 5,492 Contractual receipts: Finance receivables 2,350 1,015 850 584 566 1,398 6,763 Operating leases 24 18 14 12 12 28 108 Total contractual receipts 2,374 1,033 864 596 578 1,426 6,871 Cash 10 10 Total cash and contractual receipts 2,384 1,033 864 596 578 1,426 6,881 Net cash and contractual receipts (payments) $ 143 $ (60 ) $ 36 $ 51 $ 20 $ 1,199 $ 1,389 Cumulative net cash and contractual receipts $ 143 $ 83 $ 119 $ 170 $ 190 $ 1,389 Finance receivable receipts are based on contractual cash flows. These amounts could differ due to prepayments, charge offs and other factors. Contractual receipts and payments exclude finance charges and discounts from receivables, debt interest payments, proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items. As shown in the preceding table, cash collections from finance assets are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities. At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had $2.2 billion in debt and $439 million in Other Liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months. 28 At December 31, 2005, Textron Finance had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under $1.2 billion of committed revolving lines of credit, compared with $1.0 billion at January 1, 2005. Since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Textron has joint venture agreements with external financing arrangements for which Textron has guaranteed approximately $15 million in debt obligations, including approximately $5 million related to discontinued operations. Textron would be required to make payments under these guarantees if a joint venture defaults under the debt agreements. Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland North America Inc. (AWNA) formed the AgustaWestlandBell LLC (AWB LLC) in January 2004 for the joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product support of the US101 helicopter, recently designated the VH 71 helicopter, and certain variations and derivatives thereof, to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the U.S. Government. In March 2005, AWB LLC received a $1.2 billion cost reimbursement type subcontract from Lockheed Martin for the System Development and Demonstration phase of the U.S. Marine Corps Marine 1 Helicopter Squadron (VH 71) Program. On March 11, 2005, Bell Helicopter guaranteed to Lockheed Martin the due and prompt performance by AWB LLC of all its obligations under this subcontract, provided that Bell Helicopters liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49% of AWB LLCs aggregate liability to Lockheed Martin under the subcontract. AgustaWestland N.V., AWNAs parent company, has guaranteed the remaining 51% to Lockheed Martin. Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland N.V. have entered into cross indemnification agreements in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying partys workshare under any subcontracts received. For 2005, AWB LLCs maximum obligation is 20% of the total contract value, which equates to $232 million based on the current contract value of $1.2 billion. In 2006, AWB LLCs maximum obligation increases to 40%, or $464 million, and thereafter increases to 50%, or $580 million. Accordingly, the maximum amount of Bell Helicopters liability under the guarantee is $114 million at December 31, 2005 and will be $227 million in 2006 and $284 million thereafter through completion. Textron Manufacturing enters into a forward contract in Textron common stock on an annual basis. The contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock based incentive compensation indexed to Textron stock. The forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing Textron common stock price. As of December 31, 2005, the contract was for approximately 1.7 million shares with a strike price of $70.80. The market price of the stock was $76.98 at December 31, 2005, resulting in a receivable of $10 million, compared with a receivable of $31 million at January 1, 2005. Textron Finance sells finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and whole loan sales. As a result of these transactions, finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet, and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels. Despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position, Textron Finance generally retains a subordinate interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations, which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments. These retained interests are more fully discussed in the Securitizations section of Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Textron Finance utilizes these off balance sheet financing arrangements (primarily asset backed securitizations) to further diversify funding alternatives. These arrangements are an important source of funding that provided net proceeds from continuing operations of $361 million and $394 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Proceeds from securitizations includes proceeds received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold and excludes amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these receivables with short durations. Textron Finance has used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper. Whole loan finance receivable sales in which Textron Finance maintains a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred. Limited credit enhancement is typically provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and, to a lesser extent, prepayment risk. Textron Finance has a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease rents in 2003 and 2001. The maximum liability at December 31, 2005 was $42 million. Textron Finance has valued this contingent liability based on assumptions for annual credit losses and prepayment rates of 0.25% and 7.50%, respectively. An instantaneous 20% adverse change in these rates would have an insignificant impact on the valuation of this recourse liability. Termination of Textron Finances off balance sheet financing arrangements would significantly reduce its short term funding alternatives. While these arrangements do not contain provisions that require Textron Finance to repurchase significant balances of receivables previously sold, there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future. Potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements 29 include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality, downgrades in Textron Finances debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements. Textron Finance does not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on its liquidity or income from continuing operations. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of Textrons financial condition and results of operations are listed below. We believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes other significant accounting policies. Receivable and Inventory Reserves We evaluate the collectibility of our commercial and finance receivables based on a combination of factors. For larger balance commercial loans, Textron Finance considers borrower specific information, industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows, as well as the factors reviewed for its homogeneous loan pools. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its short term financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit scores, geographic economic conditions, etc.), we record a specific reserve for bad debts for amounts we estimate to be potentially uncollectible. Receivables are charged off when deemed uncollectible. For homogeneous loan pools and all other receivables, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on current delinquencies, the characteristics of the existing accounts, historical loss experience, the value of underlying collateral, and general economic conditions and trends. Textron Finance estimates that its losses will range from 0.5% to 4.0% of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool. Finance receivables are written down to the fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the collateral is repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months unless we deem the receivable collectible. Reserves on certain finance receivables are determined using estimates of related collateral values based on historical recovery rates and current market conditions. Management reviews the market conditions for used equipment and aircraft inventories on a periodic basis. A deterioration in market conditions resulting in lower recovery rates would result in lower estimated collateral values, increasing the amount of reserves required on related receivables and used inventories on hand. Based on current market conditions and recovery rates, we believe our reserves are adequate as of December 31, 2005. Long Term Contracts We recognize revenue and profit as work on certain government long term engineering, development and production contracts progresses using the contract method of accounting, which relies on estimates of the total contract cost and revenue. Estimated contract cost and revenue are based on current contract specifications, expected engineering requirements and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries. Contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years, and the estimation of these costs requires substantial judgment. The cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change. Adjustments to projected costs are recognized in net earnings when determinable. Favorable changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition, while unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized earnings. Any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified. Earnings on long term contracts could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to income if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones. Goodwill We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired. We completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005 using the estimates from our long term strategic plans. No adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts. The revenue growth rates included in the plans are managements 30 best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions. If different assumptions were used in these plans, the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. Within our Industrial segment, the Fluid Handling Products component has assumed an annual operating profit growth rate of approximately 9% over the five year planning period driven by anticipated revenue growth of approximately 4% annually along with increased profit margins from improvements resulting from ongoing transformation efforts. A 100 basis point reduction in the estimated operating profit growth rate from those used in our discounted cash flow model to approximately 8% would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately $20 million, and may result in the carrying value of the business exceeding its estimated fair value, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. At December 31, 2005, the goodwill allocated to this business totaled approximately $200 million. Securitized Transactions Securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts. While the assets sold are no longer on our balance sheet, our retained interests are included in Other Assets. We may retain an interest in the transferred assets in the form of interest only securities, seller certificates, cash reserve accounts, and servicing rights and obligations. Our retained interests are subordinate to other investors interests in the securitizations. Generally, we do not provide legal recourse to third party investors that purchase interests in our securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained interest only securities, seller certificates and cash reserve accounts. We estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future cash flows expected using our best estimates of prepayment speeds, credit losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. These assumptions are reviewed each quarter, and the retained interests are written down when the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on revised estimates and the decline is estimated to be other than temporary. Based on our sensitivity analysis, as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a 20% adverse change in either the prepayment speed, expected credit losses or the residual cash flows discount rate would not result in a material charge to income. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors. Other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increases. To determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. For 2005, we have reduced the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense to 8.57% from 8.72% in 2004. While over the past ten years, returns for the largest pool of managed retirement assets have exceeded 9.97%, the weighted average expected long term rate of return assumption was lowered to reflect the generally expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets, as well as the change in our investment portfolio mix. Our qualified domestic plans compose over 83% of our total pension obligations. In 2005, the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans was 8.75%. A 50 basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a $21 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans. The discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long term interest rates change. A lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. In 2005, we decreased our weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense to 5.69% from 6.17% in 2004. For our qualified domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 5.75% for 2005. A 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a $32 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans. The estimated accumulated benefit obligations for certain pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at December 31, 2005. However, strong asset returns and contributions to the plans reduced the shortfall during 2005. Accordingly, we recorded a non cash adjustment to shareholders equity for the minimum pension liability of $34 million, net of income taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The 2005 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rate, which is the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, was 11%. The medical rate is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2009 and then remain at that level. The prescription drug rate is expected to rise to 12% 31 in 2006, then decrease to 5% by 2013 and then remain at that level. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognized future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), as appropriate. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. The valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123 R), which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123 R requires companies to measure compensation costs for share based payments to employees, including stock options, at fair value and expense such compensation over the service period beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the transition date for companies to the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, effectively delaying Textrons required adoption of SFAS No. 123 R until the first quarter of 2006. Textron elected to adopt SFAS No. 123 R in the first quarter of 2005 using the modified prospective method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized in 2005 includes: a) compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted prior to but not yet vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated and recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and b) compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted subsequent to January 1, 2005, and all share based compensation awards accounted for as liabilities, based upon the measurement and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 R. For awards granted or modified in 2005 and prospectively, compensation costs for awards with only service conditions that vest ratably are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Compensation costs for awards granted prior to 2005 are recognized using the attribution methods required under SFAS No. 123. Upon adoption, Textron re measured its share based compensation awards that are accounted for as liabilities at fair value. The cumulative effect of adoption upon this re measurement resulted in an increase to net income of approximately $1 million in the first quarter of 2005, which is not considered to be material and is recorded in selling and administrative expense. Adoption of SFAS No. 123 R resulted in recognition of stock option costs in 2005. The stock option costs are included primarily in selling and administrative expense and totaled approximately $15 million for continuing operations and $2 million for discontinued operations in 2005. In accordance with the modified prospective method, prior periods have not been restated. No compensation expense related to stock option grants has been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2003 and 2004, as all of the options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. As of December 31, 2005, $58 million represents the total compensation cost associated with unvested share based compensation awards subject only to service conditions that has not yet been recognized. Textron expects that this compensation will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years. As of December 31, 2005, $25 million represents the total compensation cost associated with unvested share based compensation awards subject to performance vesting conditions that has not yet been recognized. Textron expects that this compensation will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years. 32 SFAS No. 123 R requires that the excess tax benefits received related to stock option exercises be presented as financing cash inflows. For 2005, $14 million of these excess tax benefits have been presented as cash provided by financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The valuation of stock options requires numerous assumptions. Textron determines the fair value of each option as of the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. This model requires inputs for the expected volatility of Textrons common stock price, expected life of the option and expected dividend yield, among others. In addition, we estimate the number of options expected to eventually vest. Expected volatility estimates are based on implied volatilities from traded options on Textron common stock, historical volatilities and other factors. Textron uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior, adjusted to reflect anticipated increases in expected life. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risks Our financial results are affected by changes in U.S. and foreign interest rates. As part of managing this risk, we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa. The overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt. We continuously monitor our mix of floating and fixed rate debt and adjust the mix, as necessary, based on our evaluation of internal and external factors. The difference between the rates Textron Manufacturing received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2005, 2004 or 2003. Within the Finance segment, a strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities limits our risk to changes in interest rates. This strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements. At December 31, 2005, floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were $156 million, net of $2.9 billion of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixed rate debt to a floating rate equivalent and $122 million of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixed rate finance receivables to a floating rate equivalent. For Textron Finance, interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the effect of decreasing interest expense by $11 million, $40 million and $43 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risks Our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold. For 2005, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2004 increased revenues by approximately $31 million (0.4%) and decreased segment profit by approximately $3 million (0.4%). Textron Manufacturing manages its exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset. During 2005, Textron Manufacturing primarily used borrowings denominated in euro and British pound sterling for these purposes. In managing its foreign currency transaction exposures, Textron Manufacturing also enters into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts. These contracts are generally used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately $699 million at the end of 2005 and $493 million at the end of 2004. Quantitative Risk Measures In the normal course of business, we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading. To quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis. The financial instruments that are subject to market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk) include finance receivables (excluding lease receivables), debt (excluding lease obligations), interest rate exchange agreements, foreign exchange contracts, marketable equity securities and marketable security price forward contracts. Presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year end. We estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and independent investment bankers. This sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10% decrease in interest rates, a 10% strengthening in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and a 10% decrease in the quoted market prices of applicable marketable equity securities. 33 2005 2004 Sensitivity of Sensitivity of Fair Value Fair Value Carrying Fair to a 10% Carrying Fair to a 10% (In millions) Value* Value* change Value* Value* change Interest rate risk Textron Manufacturing: Debt $ (1,934 ) $ (2,012 ) $ (36 ) $ (1,770 ) $ (1,881 ) $ (34 ) Interest rate exchanges (10 ) (10 ) 3 (2 ) (2 ) 4 Textron Finance: Finance receivables 5,589 5,515 32 4,793 4,747 42 Interest rate exchanges receivables 8 8 3 12 12 4 Debt (5,420 ) (5,423 ) (92 ) (4,783 ) (4,864 ) (66 ) Interest rate exchanges debt (47 ) (47 ) 32 3 3 10 Foreign exchange rate risk Textron Manufacturing: Debt (932 ) (974 ) (97 ) (758 ) (796 ) (80 ) Foreign currency exchange contracts 23 23 56 34 34 36 Equity price risk Textron Manufacturing: Marketable security price forward contracts 10 10 (13 ) 31 31 (14 ) * Asset or (liability) Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and other oral and written statements made by Textron from time to time are forward looking statements, including those that discuss strategies, goals, outlook or other non historical matters; or project revenues, income, returns or other financial measures.
