Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview and Outlook We had a strong year in 2006 with many notable accomplishments across the enterprise. From a financial perspective, revenues, earnings and operating cash flows from continuing operations were all up significantly, despite the challenges at Bell with the H 1 upgrade and Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) programs. From a portfolio perspective, we completed several strategic actions to strengthen our product mix. Our continued focus on the generation and support of organic growth through strong investments in engineering, research and development and capacity expansion were evident across the enterprise. For example, at Bell Helicopter, our reinvigorated commercial line contributed to a 30% increase in commercial deliveries in 2006 and we are optimistic about continued helicopter growth, in large part, due to the markets enthusiasm for our recently introduced 429 model. New products at Cessna also are generating extraordinary customer interest and expanding the scope of our market. This year we introduced two additions to our line of Citation jets, the XLS+ and the CJ4. We also were the first to certify and deliver a jet, the Mustang, in the new entry level jet category. For the year, we booked 496 new jet orders, which demonstrates the strength of our product line and the market in general. Some of the more notable financial highlights for 2006 include: Revenues increased 14% to $11.5 billon in 2006, primarily driven by growth in our aerospace, defense and finance businesses. Our organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions, was 15%. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 44% to $5.43. The combination of higher revenues and our ongoing cost containment and operational efficiency initiatives, along with a decrease in the average of diluted common shares outstanding, translated into a growth rate more than triple our revenue growth rate. Operating cash flows from our Manufacturing businesses increased by 25% to $1.1 billion. With our strong operating cash flows and solid balance sheet, we were able to make strategic business acquisitions and return value to our shareholders as follows: We repurchased 8.6 million shares of our common stock for $751 million. We increased our dividend by $0.15 per share to $1.55 per share, resulting in total dividend payments of $244 million. We added two companies, Innovative Survivability Technologies and Overwatch Systems, to our defense business for $338 million. We acquired a distribution finance business from Electrolux in our Finance segment for $164 million. Commercial backlog increased 32% to $9.8 billion, primarily related to Cessna. In addition, our U.S. Government backlog increased 6% to $3.5 billion, primarily in the Bell segment. We received $644 million in proceeds related to the disposition of non core manufacturing businesses. These dispositions include the sale of our Fastening Systems business and Jacobsens commercial grounds care business. Revenues Earnings per Share* Manufacturing Cash Provided by Operating Activities* * Diluted earnings per share and Manufacturing cash provided by operating activities are for continuing operations only. 13 Outlook Looking ahead, we expect 2007 revenues in excess of $12 billion, with growth led by our aerospace and defense businesses. We expect strong growth in business jet deliveries as we deliver against our record backlog and respond to increasing global demand. We also are preparing to deliver more commercial helicopters in 2007 as we execute against backlog in this market. Our defense businesses are expected to remain strong as we continue to support the U.S. Governments efforts in Iraq and elsewhere. We expect segment profit to increase reflecting improvements in each of the manufacturing segments. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues In 2006, our revenues increased $1.5 billion primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of $1.0 billion, higher pricing of $274 million and higher revenues in the Finance segment of $170 million. In 2005, revenues increased $1.7 billion primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of $1.3 billion, higher pricing of $159 million, additional revenues of $115 million from acquisitions and higher revenues in the Finance segment of $83 million. Segment Profit In 2006, our segment profit increased $121 million primarily due to higher pricing of $274 million, higher sales volume of $198 million, improved cost performance of $54 million in the Industrial segment, favorable warranty performance at Cessna of $39 million and higher profit in the Finance segment of $39 million. These increases were partially offset by inflation of $272 million, higher spending for engineering and new product development of $74 million, higher overhead of $55 million in Bells commercial business and increased charges related to the H 1 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts of $68 million. In 2005, segment profit increased $296 million primarily due to higher sales volume of $319 million, higher pricing of $159 million and higher profit in the Finance segment of $26 million. These increases were partially offset by inflation of $227 million. Special Charges Special charges totaled $118 million for 2005 and included $112 million in charges related to the 2001 disposition of the Automotive Trim business (Trim) and $6 million in restructuring expense in the Industrial segment. In 2004, special charges totaled $59 million and included $71 million in restructuring expense principally in the Industrial segment, partially offset by a $12 million gain on the sale of common stock acquired in connection with the Trim disposition. In connection with the disposition of Trim to subsidiaries of Collins & Aikman Corporation (C&A), we acquired preferred stock in C&A Products Co. (C&A Products) and C&A common stock. In the first quarter of 2005, we recorded a $52 million impairment charge to write down the preferred stock based on an agreement to sell the stock to a third party. In the second quarter of 2005, based on C&A Products filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and relevant market considerations, we wrote off the remaining book value of the preferred stock of $39 million. In connection with the Trim disposition, our Finance group has recourse to our Manufacturing group for equipment leases with the subsidiaries of C&A. The outstanding balance on these leases totaled approximately $61 million at December 30, 2006. Based on uncertainties related to these leases, our Manufacturing group recorded a $10 million reserve to special charges in the fourth quarter of 2005. Certain other operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of C&A upon the sale of Trim. As discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, we guaranteed C&As payments under these operating leases and for an environmental matter. In the fourth quarter of 2005, based on C&As failure to pay certain leases, as well as the negotiations entered into at the time for the sale of C&As European operations, we recorded an $11 million charge to special charges to cover our exposure under these leases, along with certain environmental and workers compensation matters. We substantially completed our company wide restructuring program at the end of 2005. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about this program. In 2005, we recorded $6 million in restructuring expense under the program for severance and other associated costs. In 2004, we recorded $71 million in restructuring expense under the program with $37 million in contract termination costs, $28 million in severance costs and $6 million in other associated costs. We have approximately $30 million in restructuring reserves remaining at the end of 2006 primarily related to contract termination costs for one lease in the Industrial segment which will be paid out over the next 13 years. Corporate Expenses and Other, net Corporate expenses and other, net increased $3 million in 2006 principally due to $7 million of higher share based compensation expense and $4 million of higher incentive compensation, partially offset by $8 million of lower expenses related to corporate initiatives. 14 Corporate expenses and other, net increased $42 million in 2005, principally due to $16 million for higher compensation and pension costs, $9 million for corporate initiatives and $7 million for the corporate portion of share based compensation expense recorded upon the adoption of a new accounting standard. Income Taxes A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is provided below: 2006 2005 2004 Federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from: Valuation allowance on contingent receipts 2.1 State income taxes 2.3 0.9 1.3 Special foreign dividend 0.1 2.1 Favorable tax settlements (2.4 ) Canadian dollar functional currency (1.2 ) Foreign tax rate differential (2.7 ) (5.0 ) (4.8 ) Export sales benefit (0.8 ) (1.1 ) (1.0 ) Other, net (2.6 ) (1.8 ) (2.0 ) Effective income tax rate 27.6 % 30.2 % 30.6 % Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflect after tax results of Fastening Systems, InteSys, OmniQuip and the Small Business Direct financing business, all of which have been sold. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these divestiture activities. Operating results of these discontinued businesses, primarily related to Fastening Systems, are as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue $ 1,101 $ 1,936 $ 1,994 (Loss) income from discontinued operations before special charges (94 ) (388 ) 72 Special charges (11 ) (91 ) Loss from discontinued operations (94 ) (399 ) (19 ) Income tax (expense) benefit (11 ) 40 9 Operating loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (105 ) (359 ) (10 ) Gain on disposal, net of income taxes 46 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ (105 ) $ (313 ) $ (10 ) In 2005, the loss from discontinued operations includes a $335 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Fastening Systems business. In addition, we recorded an after tax charge of approximately $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, which included $37 million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and $7 million in curtailment losses for employee retirement plans. After these charges, we assessed the estimated fair value of the business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was required at that time. In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an additional $120 million after tax impairment charge to record the business at the estimated fair value less cost to sell at the time based on offers received from potential purchasers. In 2005, we recorded a net $46 million gain on disposal, primarily related to a tax benefit recorded upon the sale of InteSys. Segment Analysis Our four reportable segments are: Bell, Cessna, Industrial and Finance. These segments reflect the manner in which we manage our operations. Segment profit is an important measure used to evaluate performance and for decision making purposes. Segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses and special charges. The measurement for the Finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges. 15 Each segments revenues and profit as a percentage of consolidated revenues and profit are provided below: 2006 Revenues $11.5 Billion 2006 Segment Profit $1.3 Billion Bell (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 3,408 $ 2,881 $ 2,254 Segment profit $ 249 $ 368 $ 250 Profit margin 7 % 13 % 11 % Backlog at Bell Helicopter $ 3,119 $ 2,812 $ 2,842 Bell Helicopter currently is in the early stages of development or production for a number of government and commercial programs that are anticipated to significantly drive revenue and profit growth in future years. Government programs generally follow a three phase cycle consisting of: development, transition to production, and full rate production ramp up. Each phase has specific risks and operational challenges. Over the next few years, Bell Helicopters major government programs will be transitioning through various phases of this cycle. Bell Helicopter programs with the U.S. Government include the V 22 military tiltrotor aircraft, the H 1 upgrade program and the ARH program. The V 22 program is in full rate production and delivered 16 aircraft in 2006. The H 1 upgrade program is in the transition to production phase, and the ARH program is in the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase. In 2006, we made significant investments to conduct research and development, transition development contracts to production, increase our production capacity and implement improved operational systems to manage anticipated growth in Bell Helicopters programs. These investments have negatively impacted our financial results, and include significant ongoing production ramp up (primarily for the V 22 program), ongoing development efforts related primarily to the 429 model and the ARH program, and the H 1s transition to production. The costs of investing in improved operational systems resulted in higher overhead expenses during 2006. While these higher overhead costs have been reflected in lower 2006 earnings in the commercial business, a portion of these costs have been absorbed into overhead in the government business due to the relatively long production cycle, particularly into V 22 production inventory. The overhead costs are anticipated to moderate in 2007. However, as V 22 aircraft currently in production are delivered in future periods, the 2006 overhead expenses reflected in inventory will result in lower margins on these shipments. Textron Systems has continued to experience strong growth in its U.S. Government business, delivering 471 Armored Security Vehicles (ASV) in 2006 to support our troops in Iraq and elsewhere. During 2006, Textron Systems added to its offerings to the defense industry by acquiring two businesses, Innovative Survivability Technologies and Overwatch Systems. Bell Revenues U.S. Government Business In 2006, revenues increased $376 million, compared with 2005 primarily due to higher net volume and mix of $343 million and the benefit from acquisitions of $28 million. The volume increase is primarily due to higher ASV deliveries of $286 million, higher ARH SDD development revenue of $94 million, increased spares and service sales of $37 million, and additional Intelligent Battlefield Systems volume of $22 million, partially offset by lower V 22 volume of $80 million and lower H 1 revenue of $18 million. In 2005, revenues increased $491 million, compared with 2004 primarily due to higher revenue of $288 million from the V 22 program, higher ASV volume of $61 million, the benefit of $36 million from the US Helicopter acquisition, higher military spares volume of $32 million and increased sales of $20 million for air launched weapons. Additionally, Bell recognized $21 million on the ARH SDD contract. 16 Commercial Business In 2006, commercial revenues increased $151 million, compared with 2005 due to higher volume of $105 million and pricing of $46 million. The volume increase is primarily due to higher civil aircraft deliveries of $176 million, higher spares and service sales of $53 million and additional deliveries of Huey II kits of $10 million, partially offset by lower international military deliveries of $116 million. In 2005, commercial revenues increased $136 million, compared with 2004 primarily due to higher aircraft sales of $68 million, higher spares volume of $41 million and higher international military sales of $26 million. International military sales increased primarily due to higher ASV deliveries to foreign customers of $58 million, partially offset by lower helicopter volume of $32 million. Bell Segment Profit U.S. Government Business In 2006, profit in our U.S. Government business decreased $25 million, compared with 2005. The decrease was primarily due to inflation of $33 million and unfavorable cost performance of $24 million, partially offset by the impact of higher net volume and mix of $35 million. The unfavorable performance reflected higher anticipated costs for the H 1 LRIP contracts of $68 million and charges of $14 million related to the ARH SDD contract, partially offset by favorable program performance at Textron Systems of $34 million, primarily related to Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, profit in our U.S. Government business increased $33 million, compared with 2004. The increase was principally due to higher V 22 volume of $26 million, reflecting the delivery of 12 aircraft from Lots 7 and 8, higher volume and improved performance of air launched weapons totaling $13 million, and increased ASV deliveries and improved performance of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by $18 million of costs associated with Hurricane Katrina. H 1 Program The H 1 program continues in development and currently is undergoing its Operational Evaluation. We also entered into three firm fixed price LRIP contracts with the U.S. Government under this program that represent the first H 1 program production aircraft. In addition, a firm fixed price option exists for a fourth production lot. During the transition to production phase, we anticipate incurring costs in excess of contractual reimbursement on the first two H 1 LRIP contracts. We anticipate that once the initial H 1 LRIP aircraft are delivered and the production operations are validated, costs will moderate as the production configuration is stabilized, production inefficiencies are resolved and learning curve improvements are realized. During 2006, we estimated that the costs to complete H 1 LRIP Lot 1 would exceed contractual reimbursement. Through the third quarter of 2006, we recorded $29 million in charges related to the H 1 LRIP Lot 1 contract. These charges primarily reflected the impact of higher estimated incremental costs for resources added to meet the contractual schedule requirements and higher anticipated efforts in final assembly. At the end of the third quarter, we had anticipated that acceptance of the initial H 1 LRIP Lot 1 aircraft by the U.S. Government would occur in the fourth quarter of 2006. However, acceptance was delayed and no aircraft were delivered. This delay was due to changes in the development and engineering requirements that were identified in the final stages of assembly and acceptance testing. Due to this delay and the costs associated with the additional development efforts, rework of in process units and resulting inefficiencies, we increased our estimate of the completion costs in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we recorded an additional $20 million charge related to the H 1 LRIP Lot 1 contract in the fourth quarter of 2006. In January 2007, the U.S. Government accepted two aircraft and we expect the remaining seven H 1 LRIP Lot 1 units to be accepted later in 2007. The H 1 LRIP Lot 2 contract is in the early stages of production, with first aircraft delivery anticipated in the second half of 2007. We now anticipate that the disruption and delays experienced with the H 1 LRIP Lot 1 contract in the fourth quarter will result in increased costs for the H 1 LRIP Lot 2 contract due to delays in its completion, as well as a reduction in previously anticipated learning curve improvements. Due to these higher cost estimates, the H 1 LRIP Lot 2 contract now is in a loss position resulting in a fourth quarter charge of $33 million. The net H 1 program charge, including favorable performance on the Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract of $3 million, was $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. ARH Program The ARH SDD contract is a cost plus incentive fee contract under which our eligibility for fees is reduced as total contract costs increase. During 2006, we continued our development activities for this program and expensed $14 million in unreimbursed costs related to this effort. We continue to work with the U.S. Government on development issues, configuration changes and schedule requirements. We no longer are eligible to earn fees under this contract; however, we anticipate that any subsequent cost increases are reimbursable by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government had two firm fixed price options under this program, representing the first two LRIP lots for the delivery of 24 to 48 aircraft. Certain development requirements under the ARH SDD contract must be met before the U.S. Government can exercise the options. We presently anticipate that the development requirements will be met in mid 2007. The option for the first LRIP lot (for 6 12 aircraft) has expired, while the option for the second lot (for 18 36 aircraft) expires in December 2007. 17 In the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed certain phases of the critical design review under the ARH SDD contract and determined the initial production configuration of the aircraft, which includes aircraft configuration changes required by the U.S. Government. Our cost estimates based on this configuration, which include anticipated transition to production costs, exceed the fixed pricing contained in the options. We currently are in discussions with the U.S. Government related to the possible reinstatement of the ARH Lot 1 option, extension of the options, delivery schedule, number of units to be exercised under the options and possible additional aircraft to be contracted, in addition to those under the options, at revised pricing. We also are reviewing our ability to claim equitable adjustment recovery from the U.S. Government related to certain costs that potentially could be incurred related to the exercise of these options. Depending on the results of the SDD contract, our cost containment efforts, the availability of U.S. Government funding, the number of aircraft exercised or ultimately contracted for, and the resolution of our discussions with the U.S. Government, we currently estimate that it is reasonably possible that our exposure could be in the range of no loss to a possible loss of $4 million per aircraft. This estimate excludes the impact of discussions with the U.S. Government or any potential recoveries including claims for equitable adjustment under the contracts. Due to the uncertainty of this exposure and the ultimate outcome of our discussions, we do not believe that a loss is probable under the guidelines established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.5, Accounting for Contingencies. Accordingly, we have not established a reserve at December 30, 2006. Commercial Business In 2006, commercial profit decreased $94 million, compared with 2005 primarily due to unfavorable cost performance of $140 million and inflation of $28 million, partially offset by higher pricing of $46 million and the impact of increased volume and mix of $42 million. The unfavorable cost performance reflected increased overhead costs of $55 million, the impact of the $30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Model AB139 program in 2005, higher net research and development expense of $29 million and the $13 million prior year impact of the resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a collaborative research and development agreement, partially offset by $18 million in additional reserves recorded by Lycoming in 2005 for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins. In 2005, commercial profit increased $85 million, compared with 2004 primarily due to the $30 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Model AB139 helicopter program, the $29 million impact of higher international military volume and improved performance, higher spares volume of $22 million and a $13 million impact upon resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a prior year collaborative research and development sharing agreement. In addition, commercial profit reflected a $16 million decrease in net research and development, as higher gross research and development expenses of $28 million were more than offset by the commercial share of reimbursements related to risk sharing agreements from codevelopment partners. These increases were partially offset by $28 million of higher selling and administrative expense and $18 million in additional reserves recorded by Lycoming in 2005 for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins. Cessna (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 4,156 $ 3,480 $ 2,473 Segment profit $ 645 $ 457 $ 267 Profit margin 16 % 13 % 11 % Backlog $ 8,467 $ 6,342 $ 5,352 Demand in the business jet market continued to strengthen in 2006, which was reflected in a 34% increase in our backlog, despite a 22% increase in business jet deliveries. Over the past three years, Cessna has increased its annual production rate and has continued to focus on improving margins while investing in engineering, research and development in Cessnas continual effort to bring new technology and products to market. Citation business jets are the largest component of Cessnas revenues. We delivered 307, 252 and 179 Citation business jets in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing 77%, 76% and 72% of Cessnas total revenues. Cessna Revenues Revenues at Cessna increased $676 million in 2006, compared with 2005 due to higher volume of $493 million, primarily related to Citation business jets, and favorable pricing of $183 million. In 2005, Cessnas revenues increased $1.0 billion, compared with 2004 primarily due to higher Citation business jet volume of $737 million, higher pricing of $82 million and a benefit from the consolidation of CitationShares of $78 million. 18 Cessna Segment Profit Segment profit increased $188 million at Cessna in 2006, compared with 2005 primarily due to higher pricing of $183 million, the impact of higher volume of $102 million and favorable warranty performance of $39 million, partially offset by inflation of $112 million and higher engineering and product development costs of $41 million. Favorable warranty performance included the $24 million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in 2006, as well as a $15 million incremental benefit from other favorable warranty performance in 2006 (a $33 million benefit in 2006 compared with $18 million in 2005). During initial model launches, Cessna typically incurs higher warranty related costs until the production process matures, at which point warranty costs moderate. Based on historical production and warranty patterns, management estimated that the Sovereign and CJ3 production lines had reached this maturity level, and that Sovereign and CJ3 aircraft produced in the third and fourth quarter of 2006 would incur lower warranty costs than earlier production aircraft. In 2006, Cessnas profit improved by approximately $24 million as a result of lower point of sale warranty costs for aircraft sold during the year, primarily Sovereign and CJ3, compared with 2005. Management expects improved performance on these models to continue in the foreseeable future. In 2005, Cessnas segment profit increased $190 million, compared to 2004, largely due to the $229 million impact of higher volume across all product lines and $82 million of higher pricing, partially offset by $99 million of inflation. Industrial (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 3,128 $ 3,054 $ 3,046 Segment profit $ 163 $ 150 $ 194 Profit margin 5 % 5 % 6 % The Industrial segment is composed of five businesses, including E Z GO, Jacobsen, Kautex, Greenlee and Fluid & Power. During 2006, we experienced positive organic growth in each of this segments businesses as we continued to focus on our customers. Both Fluid & Power and Kautex increased their presence in China to capitalize on the expanding market. Greenlee prepared to launch their new hand tool product line to complement their existing products. In our golf and turf care businesses, we completed the sale of our commercial grounds care business, allowing us to focus on our core golf, resort, sport turf and municipal markets. Industrial Revenues Revenues in the Industrial segment increased $74 million in 2006, compared with 2005 primarily due to higher volume of $89 million, higher pricing of $46 million and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $10 million, partially offset by the divestiture of non core product lines of $72 million. Revenues in the Industrial segment increased $8 million in 2005, compared with 2004 as higher pricing of $36 million and favorable foreign exchange of $31 million were largely offset by lower volume of $63 million. The lower sales volume primarily reflected decreases of $80 million at Kautex, largely due to product model changeovers, and $39 million at Jacobsen primarily related to the strategic realignment of its North American commercial distribution network. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume of $31 million at Greenlee. Industrial Segment Profit Segment profit in the Industrial segment increased $13 million in 2006, compared with 2005 mainly due to $54 million of improved cost performance, higher pricing of $46 million and the $24 million impact of higher net volume and mix, partially offset by $100 million of inflation and a $7 million impact from divestitures of non core product lines. Segment profit in the Industrial segment decreased $44 million in 2005, compared with 2004 largely due to inflation of $84 million and the impact of lower volume and an unfavorable mix of $21 million, partially offset by higher pricing of $36 million and improved cost performance of $24 million, primarily at Kautex. Finance (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 798 $ 628 $ 545 Segment profit $ 210 $ 171 $ 139 Profit margin 26 % 27 % 26 % 19 During 2006, the Finance segment generated significant growth in its owned and managed finance receivables. Owned finance receivables grew by $1.5 billion, up 23% from 2005 and we expect continued growth in 2007. Portfolio quality statistics reflected continued improvements in 2006. Our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total finance assets decreased to 1.28% at the end of 2006, compared with 1.53% at the end of 2005 and 2.18% at the end of 2004. While portfolio quality statistics continue to improve, the collectibility of this segments finance receivable portfolio remains one of its most significant business risks. The continued strength of our portfolio quality, combined with continued reductions in the level of loan losses, resulted in a reduction of the rate utilized to establish the allowance for losses in several of our portfolios in 2006. This resulted in a $7 million reduction in the provision for losses during 2006. We expect relative stability in our portfolio statistics during 2007. Finance Revenues Revenues in the Finance segment increased $170 million in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to a $103 million increase related to higher average finance receivables and a $90 million increase from the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by an $18 million decrease in other income largely due to lower fees and securitization income. Average finance receivables increased $1.3 billion from levels in the corresponding period in 2005 primarily due to growth in the distribution, golf and aviation finance businesses. Revenues in the Finance segment increased $83 million in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher finance charges and discounts of $95 million, partially offset by lower prepayment income of $10 million. The increase in finance charges was largely due to a higher interest rate environment, which accounted for $98 million of the increase, and $62 million related to higher average finance receivables of $855 million, partially offset by lower relative receivable pricing of $65 million. The increase in average finance receivables was primarily related to growth in distribution, golf and aviation finance, and asset based lending, partially offset by reductions in liquidating non core portfolios. Finance Segment Profit Segment profit in the Finance segment increased $39 million in 2006, compared with 2005 due to an increase in net interest margin. The growth in average finance receivables generated $54 million of higher net margin, which was partially offset by an $18 million decrease in other income. Segment profit in the Finance segment increased $32 million in 2005, compared with 2004 primarily due to a $29 million decrease in the provision for loan losses as a result of sustained improvements in portfolio quality and an $18 million increase in net interest margin, which was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses of $15 million. The increase in net interest margin was primarily attributable to portfolio growth. Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to $9 million in higher variable compensation associated with portfolio growth and $5 million related to improved profitability and increased pension and benefits cost. Finance Portfolio Quality The following table presents information about the Finance segments portfolio quality: (In millions, except for ratios) 2006 2005 2004 Finance receivables $ 8,310 $ 6,763 $ 5,837 Allowance for losses on finance receivables $ 93 $ 96 $ 99 Nonperforming assets $ 113 $ 111 $ 140 Provision for loan losses $ 26 $ 29 $ 58 Net charge offs $ 29 $ 32 $ 79 Ratio of nonperforming assets to total finance assets 1.28 % 1.53 % 2.18 % Ratio of allowance for losses on receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables 123.1 % 108.6 % 83.7 % 60+ days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables 0.77 % 0.79 % 1.47 % Nonperforming assets by business are as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Golf finance $ 29 $ 13 $ 26 Resort finance 16 31 53 Asset based lending 16 6 7 Aviation finance 12 14 12 Distribution finance 7 2 5 Liquidating portfolios 33 45 37 Total nonperforming assets $ 113 $ 111 $ 140 20 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual finance receivables and repossessed assets that are not guaranteed by our Manufacturing group. We believe that nonperforming assets generally will be in the range of 1% to 4% of finance assets depending on economic conditions. In 2006, the $16 million increase in golf finance is primarily the result of two delinquent golf course mortgage loans whose operations were affected by the prolonged effects of Hurricane Katrina, while the $10 million increase in asset based lending is the result of two loans in unrelated industries. The $27 million improvement in resort finance and the liquidating portfolios in 2006, principally reflected charge offs against existing reserves and remedial collection activity. In 2005, nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to resort and golf finance, reflecting improvement in general economic conditions, partially offset by an increase in our liquidating portfolios due to two loans. The non core liquidating portfolios continue to compose a disproportionate amount of the nonperforming assets accounting for 29% of total nonperforming assets while comprising less than 2% of the total finance assets at December 30, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group consists of Textron Inc., consolidated with the entities that operate in the Bell, Cessna and Industrial segments, while the Finance group consists of the Finance segment, comprised of Textron Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements. Through our Finance group, we provide diversified commercial financing to third parties. In addition, this group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer that is financed by the Finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow on our Finance groups statement of cash flows. Meanwhile, the Manufacturing group records the cash received from the Finance group on the customers behalf within operating cash flows as a cash inflow on our Manufacturing groups statement of cash flows. Although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows, as detailed below in the operating cash flows of continuing operations section. Under a support agreement, Textron Inc. is required to maintain 100% ownership of Textron Financial Corporation. The agreement also requires Textron Inc. to ensure that Textron Financial Corporation maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders equity of no less than $200 million. Operating Cash Flows of Continuing Operations (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Manufacturing group $ 1,119 $ 894 $ 973 Finance group 338 247 161 Reclassifications and elimination adjustments (440 ) (189 ) (185 ) Consolidated $ 1,017 $ 952 $ 949 Cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for our operating needs, dividends and capital expenditures. We analyze operating cash flows for our Manufacturing group by tracking free cash flow. We calculate free cash flow using net cash provided by operating activities, adding back proceeds on the sale of property, plant and equipment, then subtracting capital expenditures, including those financed with capital leases. 21 The Manufacturing groups operating cash flows increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations and a decrease in working capital components. Consolidated operating cash flows increased primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations for both borrowing groups and a decrease in working capital components, partially offset by a $224 million increase in net captive financing activity as explained below. Reclassification and Elimination Adjustments (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Reclassifications from investing activities: Finance receivable originations for Manufacturing group inventory sales $ (1,015 ) $ (824 ) $ (892 ) Cash received from customers and securitizations for captive financing 691 724 727 Other (36 ) 11 51 Total reclassifications from investing activities (360 ) (89 ) (114 ) Dividends paid by Finance group to Manufacturing group (80 ) (100 ) (71 ) Total reclassifications and adjustments $ (440 ) $ (189 ) $ (185 ) Finance receivable originations for Manufacturing group inventory sales increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to financings related to aircraft sales growth during the period. However, cash received for these captive receivables decreased in 2006 as higher cash receipts from our customers were offset by $126 million in lower proceeds from securitizations. Investing Cash Flows of Continuing Operations (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Manufacturing group $ (742 ) $ (362 ) $ (158 ) Finance group (1,680 ) (950 ) (756 ) Reclassifications to operating activities 360 89 114 Consolidated $ (2,062 ) $ (1,223 ) $ (800 ) Over the past three years, consolidated investing cash flows have been largely driven by increases in cash outflows at our Finance group due to higher non captive finance receivable originations, net of cash collections from repayments, sales and securitizations, of $301 million, $198 million and $744 million, respectively. The $380 million increase in cash used for the Manufacturing group in 2006 is largely due to the acquisition of two businesses in the Bell segment for $338 million in cash, along with an increase in capital expenditures of $63 million. In 2005, the Manufacturing group increased its use of cash for investing by $204 million with $118 million in higher capital expenditures, along with a $38 million decrease in proceeds that were received in 2004 from the sale of C&A common stock. The increases in capital expenditures in 2006 and 2005 are primarily related to higher spending at the Bell segment in response to increased production demands. Capital expenditures related to our manufacturing operations totaled $435 million in 2006, $371 million in 2005 and $282 million in 2004, including expenditures purchased through capital leases of $16 million in 2006, $15 million in 2005 and $44 million in 2004. Financing Cash Flows of Continuing Operations (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Manufacturing group $ (1,072 ) $ (403 ) $ (708 ) Finance group 1,391 587 361 Dividends paid by Finance group to Manufacturing group 80 100 71 Consolidated $ 399 $ 284 $ (276 ) Our Manufacturing group used $669 million more cash for financing activities in 2006 compared with 2005. The increase is primarily due to the paydown of $242 million of short term debt in 2006 compared with the issuance of $281 million of short term debt in 2005, and to a $164 million increase in purchases of our common stock. Our Manufacturing group used less cash for financing activities in 2005 than in 2004 principally due to the issuance of the short term debt in 2005 and the retirement of debt of $300 million in 2004, partially offset by a $182 million increase in purchases of our common stock and $81 million in lower proceeds from employee stock ownership plans. Our Finance group has continued to increase its debt outstanding over the past three years to fund asset growth. 22 Stock Repurchases In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we repurchased approximately 8,574,000, 8,035,000 and 6,534,000 shares of common stock, respectively, under Board authorized share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of $751 million, $606 million and $425 million, respectively. On January 26, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a new 12 million share repurchase program of which 4.4 million shares remained at December 30, 2006. Dividends On January 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $0.15 per share increase in our annualized common stock dividend to $1.55 per share. Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $244 million, $189 million and $135 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in five payments in 2006, four payments in 2005 and three payments in 2004. Discontinued Operations Cash Flows (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Operating activities $ (48 ) $ 84 $ 1 Investing activities $ 653 $ 28 $ (18 ) Financing activities $ 2 $ (1 ) $ Discontinued operations cash flows from investing activities increased in 2006 primarily due to net cash proceeds of $636 million related to the sale of the Fastening Systems business. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning our discontinued operations. Capital Resources The debt (net of cash) to capital ratio for our Manufacturing group as of December 30, 2006 was 29%, compared with 26% at December 31, 2005, and the gross debt to capital ratio as of December 30, 2006 was 40%, compared with 37% at December 30, 2005. The 2006 ratio reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement Nos. 87, 88, 106, 132(R). Our Manufacturing group targets a gross debt to capital ratio that is consistent with an A rated company. Consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community, leverage of the Manufacturing group excludes the debt of our Finance group. In turn, our Finance group limits its borrowings to an amount, taking into account the risk profile of its assets, consistent with a single A credit rating. Surplus capital of Textron Financial Corporation is returned to Textron Inc. Borrowings historically have been a secondary source of funds for our Manufacturing group and, along with the collection of finance receivables, are a primary source of funds for our Finance group. Both borrowing groups utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs. Our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flows and satisfy certain financial ratios. Since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost, we target a long term A rating from the independent debt rating agencies. The credit ratings and outlooks of these three debt rating agencies by borrowing group are as follows: Standard & Fitch Moodys Poors Long term ratings: Manufacturing A A3 A Finance A A3 A Short term ratings: Manufacturing F2 P2 A2 Finance F2 P2 A2 Outlook Positive Stable Stable We have a policy of maintaining unused committed bank lines of credit in an amount not less than outstanding commercial paper balances. These facilities are in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only, and neither of these primary lines of credit was drawn at December 30, 2006 or December 31, 2005. 23 Our primary committed credit facilities at December 30, 2006 include the following: Amount Not Reserved as Support for Commercial Letters of Commercial Facility Paper Credit Paper and (In millions) Amount Outstanding Outstanding Letters of Credit Manufacturing group multi year facility expiring in 2011* $ 1,250 $ $ 23 $ 1,227 Finance group multi year facility expiring in 2011 $ 1,750 $ 1,719 $ 13 $ 18 * The Finance group is permitted to borrow under this multi year facility. Under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Manufacturing group may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of $2.0 billion. At December 30, 2006, we had $1.6 billion available under the Manufacturing groups registration statement. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Finance group renewed a previously filed statement to enable it to issue an unlimited amount of public debt. Our Finance group issued $1.8 billion of term debt and CAD 100 million of term debt during 2006 under its registration statements. We used the proceeds from these issuances to fund receivable growth and repay short term debt. Contractual Obligations Manufacturing Group The following table summarizes the known contractual obligations of our Manufacturing group to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of December 30, 2006, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied: Payment Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years 5 Years Total Liabilities reflected in balance sheet: Long term debt (a) $ 75 $ 346 $ $ 251 $ 16 $ 976 $ 1,664 Capital lease obligations (a) 5 5 3 3 3 117 136 Pension benefits for unfunded plans (b) 13 15 16 16 15 173 248 Postretirement benefits other than pensions (b) 77 69 66 63 60 493 828 Other long term liabilities (c) 138 75 46 33 30 300 622 Liabilities not reflected in balance sheet: Operating leases (a) 57 49 42 36 28 201 413 Purchase obligations (d) 1,980 378 118 36 15 22 2,549 Total Manufacturing group $ 2,345 $ 937 $ 291 $ 438 $ 167 $ 2,282 $ 6,460 (a) Long term debt and capital lease obligations exclude interest payments. Operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases. (b) We maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in the table above are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. We also expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans in the range of approximately $45 million to $60 million per year over the next five years, which are not reflected in this table. (c) Other long term liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2006 representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. Timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience. Many of our other long term liabilities have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments. These excluded liabilities primarily include deferred income taxes. (d) Purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of December 30, 2006. The ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts, the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the U.S. Government under normal termination clauses. In January 2005, we contracted with a third party service provider for the oversight of our information technology infrastructure, including maintenance, operational oversight and purchases of hardware (the IT Contract). The IT Contract covers a 10 year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications. We have retained the right to approve significant design, equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider. We can terminate the IT Contract for convenience prior to 24 its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed $59 million at December 30, 2006. Finance Group The following table summarizes our Finance groups known contractual obligations to make future payments. Due to the nature of finance companies, we also have contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future. We generally borrow funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of our finance receivables. The contractual payments and receipts as of December 30, 2006 are detailed below: Payments/Receipts Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years 5 Years Total Contractual payments: Commercial paper and other short term debt $ 1,779 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,779 Term debt 1,118 966 1,562 833 442 209 5,130 Operating leases 6 5 4 3 3 1 22 Total contractual payments 2,903 971 1,566 836 445 210 6,931 Cash and receipts: Finance receivables 3,554 1,396 821 497 504 1,538 8,310 Operating leases 30 23 20 18 15 26 132 Total receipts 3,584 1,419 841 515 519 1,564 8,442 Cash 47 47 Total cash and receipts 3,631 1,419 841 515 519 1,564 8,489 Net cash and receipts (payments) $ 728 $ 448 $ (725 ) $ (321 ) $ 74 $ 1,354 $ 1,558 Cumulative net cash and receipts $ 728 $ 1,176 $ 451 $ 130 $ 204 $ 1,558 Finance receivable receipts related to finance leases and term loans are based on contractual cash flows. Finance receivable receipts related to revolving loans are based on historical cash flow experience. These amounts could differ due to prepayments, charge offs and other factors. Receipts and contractual payments exclude finance charges from receivables, debt interest payments, proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items. As shown in the preceding table, our cash and receipts are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities. At December 30, 2006, our Finance group had $2.9 billion in debt and $426 million in other liabilities that are payable within the next 12 months. At December 30, 2006, our Finance group had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under $1.3 billion of committed revolving lines of credit, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005. These loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused. We are not exposed to interest rate changes on these commitments since the interest rates are not set until the loans are funded. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees We extend a variety of financial and performance guarantees to third parties as provided in the table below: December 30, 2006 December 31, 2005 Maximum Carrying Maximum Carrying Potential Amount of Potential Amount of (In millions) Payment* Liability Payment* Liability Manufacturing group: Performance guarantee $ 227 $ $ 114 $ Guaranteed minimum resale contracts 30 3 31 3 Guarantees related to dispositions 46 23 29 8 Debt obligations of joint ventures 4 10 Finance group: Loss sharing agreements $ 29 $ $ 71 $ 13 * These agreements include uncapped guarantees as described below. 25 Performance Guarantee In 2004, through our Bell Helicopter business, we formed AgustaWestlandBell LLC (AWB LLC) with AgustaWestland North America Inc. (AWNA). This venture was created for the joint design, development, manufacture, sale, customer training and product support of the VH 71 helicopter, and certain variations and derivatives thereof, to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the U.S. Government. In March 2005, AWB LLC received a $1.2 billion cost reimbursement type subcontract from Lockheed Martin for the System Development and Demonstration phase of the U.S. Marine Corps Helicopter Squadron Program. We guaranteed to Lockheed Martin the due and prompt performance by AWB LLC of all its obligations under this subcontract, provided that our liability under the guaranty shall not exceed 49% of AWB LLCs aggregate liability to Lockheed Martin under the subcontract. AgustaWestland N.V., AWNAs parent company, has guaranteed the remaining 51% to Lockheed Martin. We have entered into cross indemnification agreements with AgustaWestland N.V. in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying partys workshare under any subcontracts received. For 2006, AWB LLCs maximum obligation was 40% of the total contract value, which equates to $464 million based on the current contract value of $1.2 billion. In 2007 and thereafter, AWB LLCs maximum obligation increases to 50%, or $580 million. Accordingly, the maximum amount of our liability under the guarantee was $227 million at December 30, 2006 and will be $284 million thereafter through completion. Guaranteed Minimum Resale Contracts We have a number of guaranteed minimum resale value contracts associated with certain past aircraft sales. If the fair value of an aircraft falls below a minimum guaranteed amount, we may be required to make a future payment to the customer or provide a minimum trade in value toward a new aircraft. These agreements generally include operating restrictions such as maximum usage over the contract period or minimum maintenance requirements. We also have guaranteed the minimum resale value of certain customer owned aircraft anticipated to be traded in upon completion of a model currently under development. These contracts expire as follows: $2 million in 2008, $3 million in 2009, $3 million in 2010, $3 million in 2011 and $19 million in 2012. Guarantees Related to Dispositions We have guaranteed payment on certain credit facilities and bank issued letters of credit and guarantees of the Fastening Systems business, where the total guarantee is capped at approximately $9 million, for which the buyer has provided a letter of credit of approximately $4 million as collateral. We also have guaranteed payment and performance on certain other credit facilities and leases of the Fastening Systems business totaling approximately $14 million, where we also are liable for unpaid interest, fees and other costs associated with claims that may arise from these guarantees. While potential interest and fees are not capped, we have monitoring provisions that mitigate the exposure to these additional costs. The buyer has provided a letter of credit of approximately $9 million as collateral on these guarantees. We also have indemnified the purchaser of the Fastening Systems business for remediation costs related to pre existing environmental conditions to the extent they exist at the sold locations. We have estimated the fair value of these indemnifications at approximately $12 million. Potential payments under these obligations are not capped, and as a result the maximum potential obligation cannot be determined. In connection with the disposition of Trim to subsidiaries of C&A, certain equipment and operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of C&A. We guaranteed C&As payments under these leases and for an environmental matter. We also have obligations arising from sales of certain other businesses, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, and tax and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. Loss Sharing Agreements In connection with the sale of a note receivable in 2005, our Finance group has indemnified the purchaser against potential losses in limited circumstances. The maximum potential exposure of the indemnity is estimated to be $29 million, but due to the extremely low probability of occurrence and several other mitigating factors, including a specific indemnification from the original note issuer, no significant fair value has been attributed to the indemnity. In connection with the sale of the Small Business Direct financing business in 2003, our Finance group entered into a loss sharing agreement. This agreement required us to reimburse the purchaser for 50% of losses incurred on the portfolio above a 4% annual level. A liability of $14 million was originally recorded representing the estimated fair value of the guarantee. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with the purchaser, which terminated our obligation to reimburse the purchaser for future losses. The settlement resulted in a $1 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in 2006. At December 31, 2005, our Finance group had a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease streams with a maximum liability of $42 million. These lease streams were sold in 2006, and we had no remaining liability at the end of 2006. 26 Software Indemnifications With the acquisition of Overwatch Systems in 2006, we now are a party to software license agreements with customers. These software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Forward Contract We enter into a forward contract in our common stock on an annual basis. The contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock based incentive compensation indexed to our stock. The forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing common stock price. As of December 30, 2006, the contract was for approximately 1.5 million shares with a strike price of $77.62. The market price of the stock was $93.77 at December 30, 2006, resulting in a receivable of $24 million, compared with a receivable of $10 million at December 31, 2005. Finance Receivable Securitizations and Sales We sell finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and whole loan sales. As a result of these transactions, finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet, and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels. Despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position, we generally retain a subordinated interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations, which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments. These retained interests are more fully discussed in the Securitizations section of Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. We utilize these off balance sheet financing arrangements (primarily asset backed securitizations) to further diversify funding alternatives. These arrangements provided net proceeds from operations of $50 million and $361 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from securitizations include amounts received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold and exclude amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these short duration receivables. We have used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper. Whole loan finance receivable sales in which we maintain a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred. Limited credit enhancement occasionally is provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and, to a lesser extent, prepayment risk. At December 30, 2006, we had no remaining contingent liabilities related to credit losses or prepayment risk associated with whole loan sales. Termination of our off balance sheet financing arrangements would reduce our short term funding alternatives. While these arrangements do not contain provisions that require us to repurchase significant amounts of receivables previously sold, there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future. Potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality, downgrades in our Finance groups debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements. We do not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on our liquidity or income from operations. Critical Accounting Policies To prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. We believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which includes other significant accounting policies. Allowance for Losses on Finance Receivables Our allowance for losses on finance receivables is intended to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio, which requires the application of estimates and significant judgment as to the ultimate outcome of collection efforts and realization of collateral values, among other factors. Therefore, changes in economic conditions or credit metrics, including past due and nonperforming accounts, or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may require additions or reductions to our reserves. We evaluate the collectibility of our finance receivables based on a combination of factors. For homogeneous loan pools, we examine current delinquencies, characteristics of the existing accounts, historical loss experience, underlying collateral value, and general economic conditions and trends. We estimate losses will range from 0.3% to 6.0% of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool. For larger balance commercial loans, we also consider borrower specific information, industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows. Our process involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment. While we believe that our consideration of the factors and assumptions 27 referred to above results in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience, changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses. The allowance for losses on finance receivables currently represents 1.1% of total finance receivables. During the last five years, net charge offs as a percentage of finance receivables have ranged from 0.38% to 2.08%. Long Term Contracts We make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long term contracts. These contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed price purchase options for additional products. We accounted for these long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under the percentage of completion method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the contract term based on either input (e.g., costs incurred under the cost to cost method, which typically is used for development effort) or output (e.g., units delivered under the units of delivery method, which is used for production effort), as appropriate under the circumstances. The percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and, in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years. We are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements, complexity of design and related development costs, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs, manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change. Adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones. Goodwill We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired. We completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2006 using the estimates from our long term strategic plans. No adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions. If different assumptions were used in these forecasts, the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. The impact of reducing our fair value estimates by 10% would have no impact on our goodwill assessment, with the exception of two reporting units as described below. Assuming a 10% reduction in our fair value estimates, the carrying value of these reporting units would approximate or exceed fair value. Our operating plans and projections anticipate investments in capital expenditures at our Fluid Handling Products reporting unit to resolve current capacity issues as well as to capture additional business in the oil and gas markets over the next two years. The related volume increases are anticipated to result in approximately 25% annual operating profit growth over this period. In the remaining five year planning period, we anticipate an annual operating profit growth rate of approximately 7%, driven by anticipated revenue growth of 4% annually with increased profit margins from improvements resulting from ongoing transformation efforts. Should the revenue growth rates over the next two years approximate 28 historical levels, the estimated fair value would be reduced by up to approximately $50 million and may result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. At December 30, 2006, the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit totaled approximately $206 million. Our operating plans and projections for the Golf and Turf care reporting unit anticipate operating margin improvements over the five year planning period resulting in high single digit margins, with anticipated annual revenue growth of approximately 4%. A 100 basis point decline in our operating margin assumptions would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately $60 million and may result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. At December 30, 2006, the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit totaled approximately $141 million. Retirement Benefits We maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. These plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. We evaluate and update these assumptions annually in consultation with third party actuaries and investment advisors. We also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of compensation increases. To determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. For 2006, the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 8.54%, compared with 8.57% in 2005. In 2006 and 2005, the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans, which represent approximately 82% of our total pension obligations, was 8.75%. A 50 basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a $20 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans. The discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long term interest rates change. A lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. In 2006, we lowered the weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense to 5.55% from 5.69% in 2005. For our qualified domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 5.65% for 2006. A 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a $29 million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans. The trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The 2006 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits. The 2006 medical rate of 8% is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2009 and then remain at that level. The 2006 prescription drug rate of 12% is assumed to decrease to 5% by 2013 and then remain at that level. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates that we expect to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), as appropriate. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years, the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. The valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, or other relevant events. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. 29 Recently Announced Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). This Interpretation provides a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. We will adopt this Interpretation in the first quarter of 2007 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. This Staff Position amends SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and requires a recalculation of returns on leveraged leases if there is a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows related to income taxes generated by the leveraged lease. In accordance with this guidance, the difference between the revised calculation of earnings since lease inception and the actual amount of cumulative earnings recognized is recorded in income from continuing operations. We are required to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2007. Upon adoption, the estimated change in the projected cash flows must be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of this Staff Position resulted in a $33 million reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single definition, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This Statement applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning subsequent to November 15, 2007. We will adopt this Statement in the first quarter of 2008 and currently are evaluating its impact on our financial position and results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risks Our financial results are affected by changes in U.S. and foreign interest rates. As part of managing this risk, we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa. The overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt. We continually monitor our mix of floating and fixed rate debt and adjust the mix, as necessary, based on our evaluation of internal and external factors. The difference between the rates our Manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Our Finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities. This strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements. At December 30, 2006, floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were $431 million, net of $2.9 billion of interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted fixed rate debt to a floating rate equivalent, and $46 million of interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted fixed rate finance receivables to a floating rate equivalent. Interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the net effect of increasing interest expense for our Finance group by $27 million in 2006 and decreasing interest expense by $11 million and $40 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risks Our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold. For 2006, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from 2005 increased revenues by approximately $11 million (0.1%) and increased segment profit by approximately $2 million (0.2%). For our manufacturing operations, we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset. We primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and British pound sterling for these purposes. In managing its foreign currency transaction exposures, we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts. These contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately $765 million at the end of 2006 and $699 million at the end of 2005. 30 Quantitative Risk Measures In the normal course of business, we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading. To quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis. The financial instruments that are subject to market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk) include finance receivables (excluding lease receivables), debt (excluding lease obligations), interest rate exchange agreements, foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts. Presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year end. We estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and independent investment bankers. This sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a 10% decrease in interest rates, a 10% strengthening in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and a 10% decrease in the quoted market price of the marketable equity security. 2006 2005 Sensitivity of Sensitivity of Fair Value Fair Value Carrying Fair to a 10% Carrying Fair to a 10% (In millions) Value* Value* Change Value* Value* Change Interest rate risk Manufacturing group: Debt $ (1,800 ) $ (1,833 ) $ (36 ) $ (1,934 ) $ (2,012 ) $ (36 ) Interest rate exchanges (8 ) (8 ) 2 (10 ) (10 ) 3 Finance group: Finance receivables 7,019 6,982 27 5,589 5,515 32 Interest rate exchanges receivables 1 1 1 8 8 3 Debt (6,862 ) (6,868 ) (82 ) (5,420 ) (5,423 ) (92 ) Interest rate exchanges debt (52 ) (52 ) 31 (47 ) (47 ) 32 Foreign exchange rate risk Manufacturing group: Debt (741 ) (756 ) (76 ) (932 ) (974 ) (97 ) Foreign currency exchange contracts 12 12 58 23 23 56 Equity price risk Manufacturing group: Marketable security price forward contracts 24 24 (14 ) 10 10 (13 ) * The value represents an asset or (liability).
