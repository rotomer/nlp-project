The company achieved diversified growth across its business segments and generated net earnings of $3.3 billion, representing an increase of 28% over 2004. Other financial performance highlights include: Diluted net earnings per common share of $2.48, an increase of 26% over 2004. Revenues of $45.4 billion, a 22% increase over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased 11% over 2004. Earnings from operations of $5.4 billion, up 31% over 2004. Operating margin of 11.8%, up from 11.0% in 2004. UnitedHealth Group acquired PacifiCare Health Plans, Inc. (PacifiCare) in December 2005 for total consideration of approximately $8.8 billion, Oxford Health Plans, Inc. (Oxford) in July 2004 for total consideration of approximately $5.0 billion and Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc. (MAMSI) in February 2004 for total consideration of approximately $2.7 billion. The results of operations and financial condition of PacifiCare, Oxford and MAMSI have been included in UnitedHealth Groups consolidated financial statements since the respective acquisition dates. 2005 Results Compared to 2004 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues consist of premium revenues from risk based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care services and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. For both 18 Table of Contents premium risk based and fee based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Consolidated revenues in 2005 increased by $8.1 billion, or 22%, to $45.4 billion. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 11% in 2005 primarily as a result of rate increases on premium based and fee based services and growth in individuals served across business segments. Following is a discussion of 2005 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues totaled $41.1 billion in 2005, an increase of $7.6 billion, or 23%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, consolidated premium revenues increased by approximately 11% over 2004. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and a modest increase in the number of individuals served by our risk based products. UnitedHealthcare premium revenues increased by $5.1 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, UnitedHealthcare premium revenues increased by approximately 9% over 2004. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products. In addition, Ovations premium revenues increased by $1.8 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately 20% over 2004, driven primarily by an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products and by Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members, as well as rate increases on these products. Premium revenues from AmeriChoices Medicaid programs increased by approximately $270 million, or 9%, over 2004 driven primarily by premium rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase is due mainly to strong growth in the number of individuals served by several Specialized Care Services businesses under premium based arrangements. Service Revenues Service revenues in 2005 totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of $473 million, or 14%, over 2004. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee based arrangements during 2005, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by more than 20% due to growth in the health information and clinical research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $499 million, representing an increase of $111 million over 2004. Interest income increased by $126 million in 2005, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed income investments during the year due to the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI as well as higher yields on fixed income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $4 million in 2005, a decrease of $15 million from 2004. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues). The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 80.6% in 2004 to 79.7% in 2005. Excluding the AARP business1, 19 1 Management believes disclosure of the medical care ratio excluding the AARP business is meaningful since underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through a rate stabilization fund (RSF). Although the company is at risk for underwriting losses to the extent cumulative net losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits to date, and management believes the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract during the foreseeable future. Table of Contents the medical care ratio decreased from 79.5% in 2004 to 78.6% in 2005. These medical care ratio decreases resulted primarily from changes in product, business and customer mix and an increase in favorable medical cost development related to prior periods. Each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information, identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical costs as well as growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. On an absolute dollar basis, 2005 medical costs increased $5.7 billion, or 21%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 9% driven primarily by a 7% to 8% increase in medical cost trend due to both inflation and a slight increase in health care consumption as well as organic growth. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2005 was 15.0%, down from 15.4% in 2004. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee based revenues. Additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2005 increased $1.1 billion, or 19%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 11%. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in total individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise during 2005, excluding the impact of acquisitions, growth in Specialized Care Services and Ingenix and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2005 was $453 million, an increase of $79 million, or 21%, over 2004. Approximately $32 million of this increase was related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2004. The remaining increase is primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.7% in 2005, compared to 34.9% in 2004. The increase was mainly driven by favorable settlements of prior year tax returns during 2004. Excluding these settlements, the 2004 effective tax rate would have been approximately the same as the 2005 effective tax rate. 20 Table of Contents Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2005 2004 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 40,019 $ 32,673 22 % Uniprise 3,850 3,365 14 % Specialized Care Services 2,806 2,295 22 % Ingenix 794 670 19 % Intersegment Eliminations (2,104 ) (1,785 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 45,365 $ 37,218 22 % Earnings From Operations 2005 2004 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 3,815 $ 2,810 36 % Uniprise 799 677 18 % Specialized Care Services 582 485 20 % Ingenix 177 129 37 % Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 5,373 $ 4,101 31 % nm not meaningful Health Care Services The Health Care Services segment is composed of the UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. UnitedHealthcare offers a comprehensive array of consumer oriented health benefit plans and services for local, small and mid sized employers and individuals nationwide. Ovations provides health and well being services to individuals age 50 and older, including the administration of supplemental health insurance coverage on behalf of AARP. AmeriChoice provides network based health and well being services to state Medicaid, Childrens Health Insurance Program and other government sponsored health care programs and the beneficiaries of those programs. Health Care Services had revenues of $40.0 billion in 2005, representing an increase of $7.3 billion, or 22%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $3.0 billion, or 11%, over 2004. UnitedHealthcare accounted for approximately $1.6 billion of this increase, driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products. Ovations contributed approximately $1.2 billion to the revenue advance over 2004 largely attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members and by its Medicare Advantage products as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to an 8% increase in AmeriChoices revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions, driven primarily by premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2005 were $3.8 billion, representing an increase of $1.0 billion, or 36%, over 2004. This increase primarily resulted from revenue growth and improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcares risk based products, increases in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial fee based products, and the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI during 2004. UnitedHealthcares commercial medical care ratio decreased to 78.2% in 2005 from 79.0% in 2004 mainly due to changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services 2005 operating margin was 9.5%, an 21 Table of Contents increase from 8.6% in 2004. This increase was driven mainly by the lower commercial medical care ratio as well as changes in business and customer mix. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 311: (in thousands) 20052 2004 Commercial Risk based 7,765 7,655 Fee based 3,895 3,305 Total Commercial 11,660 10,960 Medicare 395 330 Medicaid 1,250 1,260 Total Health Care Services 13,305 12,550 1 Excludes individuals served by Ovations Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members. 2 Excludes commercial risk based membership of approximately 2.3 million, commercial fee based membership of approximately 100,000 and Medicare membership of approximately 750,000 related to the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare. These amounts have been excluded since the impact of PacifiCare on our 2005 consolidated financial results is not significant. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial business as of December 31, 2005, excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, increased by approximately 700,000 over the prior year. This included an increase of 590,000 in the number of individuals served with fee based products driven by the addition of approximately 335,000 individuals served resulting from new customer relationships and customers converting from risk based products to fee based products as well as approximately 255,000 individuals served by a benefits administrative services company acquired in December 2005. In addition, the number of individuals served with commercial risk based products increased by 110,000 driven primarily by the addition of approximately 130,000 individuals served by Neighborhood Health Partnership, acquired in September 2005, and a slight increase in net new customer relationships offset by customers converting from risk based products to fee based products. Excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare Advantage products increased by 65,000, or 20%, over 2004 due primarily to new customer relationships. AmeriChoices Medicaid enrollment decreased by 10,000 from 2004 due primarily to the withdrawal of participation in one market during the third quarter of 2005 partially offset by new customer relationships since 2004. Uniprise Uniprise provides network based health and well being services, business to business transaction processing services, consumer connectivity and technology support services nationwide to large employers and health plans, and provides health related consumer and financial transaction products and services. Uniprise revenues in 2005 were $3.9 billion, representing an increase of $485 million, or 14%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Uniprise revenues increased approximately 12% over 2004. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 7% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self insured customers. Uniprise served 10.5 million individuals and 9.9 million individuals as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations in 2005 were $799 million, representing an increase of $122 million, or 18%, over 2004. Operating margin for 2005 improved to 20.8% from 20.1% in 2004. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction 22 Table of Contents processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Additionally, Uniprises infrastructure can be scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services offers a comprehensive platform of specialty health, wellness and ancillary benefits, networks, services and resources to specific customer markets nationwide. Specialized Care Services revenues of $2.8 billion increased by $511 million, or 22%, over 2004. This increase was principally driven by an 11% increase in the number of individuals served by its specialty benefit businesses, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and rate increases related to these businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 of $582 million increased $97 million, or 20%, over 2004. Specialized Care Services operating margin was 20.7% in 2005, down from 21.1% in 2004. This decrease was due to a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by continued gains in quality initiatives and operating cost efficiencies. Ingenix Ingenix offers database and data management services, software products, publications, consulting services, outsourced services and pharmaceutical development and consulting services on a national and international basis. Ingenix 2005 revenues of $794 million increased by $124 million, or 19%, over 2004. This was driven primarily by growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 were $177 million, up $48 million, or 37%, from 2004. Operating margin was 22.3% in 2005, up from 19.3% in 2004. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. 2004 Results Compared to 2003 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues increased by $8.4 billion, or 29%, in 2004 to $37.2 billion, primarily as a result of revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004 as a result of rate increases on premium based and fee based services and growth across business segments. Following is a discussion of 2004 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues in 2004 totaled $33.5 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 32%, over 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, premium revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004. This increase was due in part to average net premium rate increases of approximately 9% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based business, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial risk based products and changes in the commercial product benefit and customer mix. In addition, Ovations premium revenues increased largely due to increases in the number of individuals it serves through Medicare Advantage products and changes in product mix related to Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on all of these products. Premium revenues from AmeriChoices Medicaid programs and Specialized Care Services businesses also increased due to advances in the number of individuals served by those businesses. 23 Table of Contents Service Revenues Service revenues in 2004 totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $217 million, or 7%, over 2003. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee based arrangements during 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased due to new business growth in the health information and clinical research businesses. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $388 million, representing an increase of $131 million over 2003. Interest income increased by $134 million in 2004, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed income investments during the year from the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule Financial Corporation (Golden Rule), which was acquired in November 2003. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $19 million in 2004, a decrease of $3 million from 2003. Medical Costs The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 81.4% in 2003 to 80.6% in 2004. Excluding the AARP business, the medical care ratio decreased from 80.0% in 2003 to 79.5% in 2004. The medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in product, business and customer mix. Each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2003 include approximately $150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. On an absolute dollar basis, 2004 medical costs increased $6.3 billion, or 30%, over 2003 principally due to the impact of the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 8% driven primarily by medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2004 was 15.4%, down from 16.9% in 2003. This decrease was driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. The existence of premium revenues within our risk based products cause them to have lower operating cost ratios than fee based products, which have no premium revenues. Additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2004 increased $868 million, or 18%, over 2003 primarily due to the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 3%. This increase was driven by a more than 3% increase in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise in 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2004 was $374 million, an increase of $75 million, or 25%, over 2003. Approximately $42 million of this increase is related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions in 2004. The remaining increase is due primarily to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 34.9% in 2004, compared to 35.7% in 2003. The decrease was driven mainly by favorable settlements of prior year income tax returns during 2004. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2004 2003 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 32,673 $ 24,807 32 % Uniprise 3,365 3,107 8 % Specialized Care Services 2,295 1,878 22 % Ingenix 670 574 17 % Intersegment Eliminations (1,785 ) (1,543 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 37,218 $ 28,823 29 % Earnings From Operations 2004 2003 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 2,810 $ 1,865 51 % Uniprise 677 610 11 % Specialized Care Services 485 385 26 % Ingenix 129 75 72 % Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 4,101 $ 2,935 40 % nm not meaningful Health Care Services Health Care Services had revenues of $32.7 billion in 2004, representing an increase of $7.9 billion, or 32%, over 2003, driven primarily by acquisitions since the beginning of 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $1.9 billion, or 8%, over 2003. UnitedHealthcare accounted for approximately $850 million of this increase, driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 9% on renewing commercial risk based business and growth in the number of individuals served by fee based products, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial risk based products. Ovations contributed approximately $770 million to the revenue advance over 2003 driven by growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare Advantage products and changes in product mix related to Medicare supplement products it provides to AARP members, as well as rate increases on all of these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by AmeriChoices Medicaid programs and Medicaid premium rate increases. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2004 were $2.8 billion, representing an increase of $945 million, or 51%, over 2003. This increase primarily resulted from Ovations and UnitedHealthcares revenue growth, improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcares commercial risk based products and the impact of the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. UnitedHealthcares commercial medical care ratio decreased to 79.0% in 2004 from 80.0% in 2003. The decrease in the commercial medical care ratio was primarily driven by net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in business and customer mix. Health Care Services 2004 operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 110 basis 25 Table of Contents points over 2003. This increase was principally driven by a combination of the improved commercial medical care ratio and changes in business and customer mix. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 311: (in thousands) 2004 2003 Commercial Risk based 7,655 5,400 Fee based 3,305 2,895 Total Commercial 10,960 8,295 Medicare 330 230 Medicaid 1,260 1,105 Total Health Care Services 12,550 9,630 1 Excludes individuals served by Ovations Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial business as of December 31, 2004, increased by nearly 2.7 million, or 32%, over the prior year. Excluding the 2004 acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and a smaller regional health plan, the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial business increased by 245,000. This included an increase of 285,000 in the number of individuals served with fee based products, driven by new customer relationships and existing customers converting from risk based products to fee based products, partially offset by a decrease of 40,000 in the number of individuals served with risk based products resulting primarily from customers converting to self funded, fee based arrangements and a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment. Excluding the impact of the Oxford acquisition, the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare Advantage products increased by 30,000, or 13%, from 2003. AmeriChoices Medicaid enrollment increased by 155,000, or 14%, due to organic growth in the number of individuals served and the acquisition of a Medicaid health plan in Michigan in February 2004, resulting in the addition of approximately 95,000 individuals served. Uniprise Uniprise revenues in 2004 were $3.4 billion, representing an increase of 8% over 2003. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self insured customers. Uniprise served 9.9 million individuals and 9.1 million individuals as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations in 2004 were $677 million, representing an increase of 11% over 2003. Operating margin for 2004 improved to 20.1% from 19.6% in 2003. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services revenues during 2004 of $2.3 billion increased by $417 million, or 22%, over 2003. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by its behavioral health benefits business, its dental services business and its vision care benefits business; rate increases related to these businesses; and incremental revenues related to businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003 of approximately $100 million. 26 Table of Contents Earnings from operations in 2004 of $485 million increased $100 million, or 26%, over 2003. Specialized Care Services operating margin increased to 21.1% in 2004, up from 20.5% in 2003. This increase was driven primarily by operational and productivity improvements within Specialized Care Services businesses and consolidation of the production and service operation infrastructure to enhance productivity and efficiency and to improve the quality and consistency of service, partially offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products. Ingenix Ingenix revenues in 2004 of $670 million increased by $96 million, or 17%, over 2003. This was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses. Earnings from operations in 2004 were $129 million, up $54 million, or 72%, from 2003. Operating margin was 19.3% in 2004, up from 13.1% in 2003. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth and improving gross margins in the health information and clinical research businesses. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2005 Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short term obligations in longer term, investment grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. Factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors approved investment policy, regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. Our long term investments are also available for sale to meet short term liquidity and other needs. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities are paid to their non regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from net earnings, prior to depreciation and amortization. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs. In 2005, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $130 million. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk. 27 Table of Contents Cash and Investments Cash flows from operating activities were $4.3 billion in 2005, an increase over $4.1 billion in 2004. The increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of $834 million in net income prior to depreciation, amortization and other noncash items partially offset by a decrease of $643 million in cash flows generated from working capital changes. We generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of $406 million in 2005 and $1,049 million in 2004. The year over year decrease primarily resulted from the Company receiving only eleven monthly Medicare premium payments during 2005 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rather than the twelve monthly payments received in 2004, negatively impacting the change in reported operating cash flows by $375 million. Additionally, there was reduced growth in medical payables during 2005 compared to 2004 due in part to an increase in electronic claim submissions and other disbursement process efficiencies. We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with cash and investments of $15.0 billion at December 31, 2005. Total cash and investments increased by $2.7 billion since December 31, 2004, primarily due to cash and investments acquired through businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, strong operating cash flows and cash received from debt issuances, partially offset by common stock repurchases, cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures. As further described under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. At December 31, 2005, approximately $270 million of our $15.0 billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases. Financing and Investing Activities In addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities, we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately $7.1 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Our debt to total capital ratio was 28.6% and 27.3% as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. We believe the prudent use of debt leverage optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity. On December 20, 2005, the company acquired PacifiCare. Under the terms of the agreement, PacifiCare shareholders received 1.1 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $21.50 in cash for each share of PacifiCare common stock they owned. Total consideration issued for the transaction was approximately $8.8 billion, composed of approximately 99.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $5.3 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of July 6, 2005), approximately $2.1 billion in cash, $960 million cash paid to retire PacifiCares existing debt and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately $420 million issued in exchange for PacifiCares outstanding vested common stock options. On February 24, 2006, our Health Care Services business segment acquired John Deere Health Care, Inc. (John Deere Health). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $500 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of John Deere Health. We issued commercial paper to finance the John Deere Health purchase price. On September 19, 2005, our Health Care Services business segment acquired Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $185 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of NHP. We issued commercial paper to finance the NHP purchase price. On December 10, 2004, our Uniprise business segment acquired Definity Health Corporation (Definity). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $305 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Definity. We used available cash and issued commercial paper to finance the Definity purchase price. 28 Table of Contents On July 29, 2004, our Health Care Services business segment acquired Oxford. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Oxford shareholders received 1.2714 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $16.17 in cash for each share of Oxford common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $5.0 billion, composed of approximately 104.4 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $3.4 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of April 26, 2004), approximately $1.3 billion in cash and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of $240 million issued in exchange for Oxfords outstanding vested common stock options. On February 10, 2004, our Health Care Services business segment acquired MAMSI. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, MAMSI shareholders received 1.64 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $18 in cash for each share of MAMSI common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $2.7 billion, composed of 72.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at $1.9 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of October 27, 2003) and approximately $800 million in cash. In November and December 2005, we issued $2.6 billion of commercial paper primarily to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of the PacifiCare acquisition described above and to retire a portion of the PacifiCare debt at the closing of the acquisition, as well as to refinance current maturities of long term debt. As of December 31, 2005, our outstanding commercial paper had interest rates ranging from 4.2% to 4.4%. In March 2005, we issued $500 million of 4.9% fixed rate notes due March 2015. We used the proceeds from this borrowing for general corporate purposes including repayment of commercial paper, capital expenditures, working capital and share repurchases. In July 2004, we issued $1.2 billion of commercial paper to fund the cash portion of the Oxford purchase price. In August 2004, we refinanced the commercial paper by issuing $550 million of 3.4% fixed rate notes due August 2007, $450 million of 4.1% fixed rate notes due August 2009 and $500 million of 5.0% fixed rate notes due August 2014. In February 2004, we issued $250 million of 3.8% fixed rate notes due February 2009 and $250 million of 4.8% fixed rate notes due February 2014. We used the proceeds from the February 2004 borrowings to finance a majority of the cash portion of the MAMSI purchase price as described above. To more closely align interest costs with the floating interest rate received on our cash and cash equivalent balances, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges. The interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion with variable rates that are benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2005, the rate used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 4.3% to 5.0%. The differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In December 2005, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion five year revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program. We increased the capacity to $1.3 billion and extended the maturity date to December 2010. In October 2005, we executed a $3.0 billion 364 day revolving credit facility to support a $3.0 billion increase in our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2005, we had no amounts outstanding under either of these credit facilities. PacifiCare had approximately $100 million par value of 3% convertible subordinated debentures (convertible notes) which were convertible into approximately 5.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Groups common stock and $102 million of cash as of December 31, 2005. In December 2005, we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture 29 Table of Contents governing the convertible notes. The compensation consisted of the present value of interest through October 18, 2007, the earliest mandatory redemption date, plus a pro rata share of $1 million. On January 31, 2006, approximately 91% of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer, for which we issued 4.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and cash of $99 million. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders equity) below 45% and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels. We are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants. Our senior debt is rated A by Standard & Poors (S&P) and Fitch, and A2 by Moodys. Our commercial paper is rated A 1 by S&P, F 1 by Fitch, and P 1 by Moodys. Consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the A range, we currently intend to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at approximately 30% or less. A significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Under our board of directors authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased 53.6 million shares at an average price of approximately $48 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2005, we had board of directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 55.5 million shares of our common stock. Our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital. A decision by the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility. We currently have a $4.0 billion universal S 3 shelf registration statement (for common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities) which has been declared effective by the SEC. In addition, we are considered a well known seasoned issuer under the Securities Offering Reform Act that became effective in December 2005. We have not yet issued any securities under this shelf registration statement. We may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering. We intend to issue debt securities during the first quarter of 2006 to refinance some or all of the commercial paper currently outstanding. Under our S 4 acquisition shelf registration statement, we have remaining issuing capacity of 48.6 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities. We filed separate S 4 registration statements for the 72.8 million shares issued in connection with the February 2004 acquisition of MAMSI, the 104.4 million shares issued in connection with the July 2004 acquisition of Oxford and the 99.2 million shares issued in connection with the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare described previously. 30 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Commitments The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2005, under our various contractual obligations, off balance sheet arrangements and commitments (in millions): 2006 2007 to 2008 2009 to 2010 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper1 $ 3,261 $ 1,450 $ 700 $ 1,700 $ 7,111 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper2 194 299 191 302 986 Operating Leases 167 287 183 172 809 Purchase Obligations3 151 45 6 202 Future Policy Benefits4 120 305 280 1,176 1,881 Other Long Term Obligations5 56 302 358 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,893 $ 2,442 $ 1,360 $ 3,652 $ 11,347 1 Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote. 2 Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2005 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. 3 Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. 4 Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay (see Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements). 5 Includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments. Currently, we do not have any other material contractual obligations, off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. AARP In January 1998, we entered into a 10 year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of AARP. These products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional Medicare. Under the terms of the contract, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. We are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program. Premium revenues from our portion of the AARP insurance offerings were approximately $4.9 billion in 2005, $4.5 billion in 2004 and $4.1 billion in 2003. The underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF). The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member services expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we would have to fund the deficit. Any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. As further described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract. 31 Table of Contents Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract The Company has contracted with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to serve as a Prescription Drug Plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage to eligible Medicare beneficiaries, beginning January 1, 2006. This product is either offered as a stand alone product or as an element of the Medicare Advantage products. As a result of this contract and the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare, premium revenues from Medicare related programs, which have historically been approximately 10% of total premium revenues, are expected to increase to approximately 25% in 2006. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions We conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. The agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings. Consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the A range, we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require. As of December 31, 2005, our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of approximately $6.4 billion, which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our most critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care provider and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to 12 months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the 32 Table of Contents period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations (in millions). FavorableDevelopment Net Impacton MedicalCosts(a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations As Reported As Adjusted(b) As Reported As Adjusted(b) 2002 $ 70 ($ 80 ) $ 18,192 $ 18,112 $ 2,186 $ 2,266 2003 $ 150 ($ 60 ) $ 20,714 $ 20,654 $ 2,935 $ 2,995 2004 $ 210 ($ 190 ) $ 27,000 $ 26,810 $ 4,101 $ 4,291 2005 $ 400 (c ) $ 32,725 (c ) $ 5,373 (c ) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year. (b) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (c) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2006 will change as our December 31, 2005 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2006. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of the companys liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2005, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the companys liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2005; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical costs as well as growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2005 estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable, excluding the AARP business, 2005 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $63 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.03 per share. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages, if any, for such matters. We do not believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2005, we had long lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, property, equipment and capitalized software, of $19.9 billion. We review our goodwill for impairment annually at the 33 Table of Contents reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period, and record changes in the period they become known. Investments As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $9.6 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2005, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $105 million and gross unrealized losses of $53 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investments fair value is other than temporary. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Inflation The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers. Through contracts with physicians and other health care providers, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. 34 Table of Contents Legal Matters Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. We record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters. These matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. Beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against both UnitedHealthcare and PacifiCare, and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. In December 2000, a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving UnitedHealth Group and our affiliates, including PacifiCare, in the Southern District Court of Florida, Miami division. Generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of ERISA and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits. Other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. The trial court granted the health care providers motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the class action status of the RICO claims, but reversed as to the breach of contract, unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims. During the course of the litigation, there have been co defendant settlements. Through a series of motions and appeals, all direct claims against us have been compelled to arbitration. A trial date has been set for September 2006. The trial court has ordered that the trial be split into separate liability and damage proceedings. In August 2005, the capitation related claims were dismissed from litigation. On January 31, 2006, the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against PacifiCare. A March 14, 2006 hearing date has been scheduled for our summary judgment motion. On March 15, 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against the company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. On April 13, 2000, we removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes of action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest payments. An amended complaint was filed on August 25, 2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class and a non ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA claims and the claims brought by the American Medical Association, a third amended complaint was filed. On October 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On May 21, 2003, we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the American Medical Association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff. On May 26, 2004, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based, in part, due to lack of standing. On July 16, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking to assert RICO violations. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described above, will, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices. The companys primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long term debt. 35 Table of Contents Approximately $14.7 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2005 were debt securities. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed income investment portfolio at December 31, 2005, the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $345 million. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. To mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short term investments. Including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $6.2 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and approximately $0.9 billion had fixed rates as of December 31, 2005. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt. At December 31, 2005, we had $261 million of equity investments, a portion of which were held by our UnitedHealth Capital business in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio. Concentrations of Credit Risk Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject UnitedHealth Group to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As discussed more fully in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we have a $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our life and annuity business. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2005, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. Cautionary Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believes, anticipates, expects, plans, seeks, intends, will likely result, estimates, projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward looking statements about future results. Any or all forward looking statements in this Form 10 K and in any other public filings or statements we make may 36 Table of Contents turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications. We must effectively manage our health care costs. Under our risk based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk based products (excluding AARP) have typically comprised approximately 75% to 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12 month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. We base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period; however, inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for UnitedHealthcares commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2005 would have been reduced by approximately $130 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. If these estimates prove too high or too low, the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results. That change can be either positive or negative to our results. We face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate. For our Uniprise and Health Care Services segments, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Humana Inc., and WellPoint, Inc., numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. Our Specialized Care Services and Ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses. The addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier or provider arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. Our relationship with AARP is important. Under our 10 year contract with AARP, which commenced in 1998, we provide Medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to AARP members. As of December 31, 2005, our portion of AARPs insurance program represented approximately $4.9 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 3.8 million AARP members. The AARP contract may be terminated early by us or AARP under certain circumstances, including a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material 37 Table of Contents adverse change in the financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangement depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. Some of the favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in Medicare remain uncertain. The changes in Medicare as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) are complex and wide ranging and continue to affect our businesses. We have taken advantage of new opportunities to partner with the federal government created by the MMA, including Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage Regional PPOs, and Special Needs Plans for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. We have invested considerable resources in creating new Medicare product offerings for these initiatives and in analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with these new programs and other changes arising from the MMA. In particular, the Part D program presents challenges because of the size and scope of the new program. Our ability to successfully participate in the Part D program depends in part on coordination of information and information systems between us, CMS and state governments. We have been working with CMS to correct systems issues that they have experienced with respect to certain low income people eligible to participate in Part D. The inability to receive correct information due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us could adversely affect our business. Additionally, our participation in the Part D program is based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, pharmaceutical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Part D program or otherwise, our results could be materially affected. Any positive or negative results of the Part D program are likely to have a significant impact on us as a result of the size of our enrollment in our Part D program. We are subject to funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. We participate as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Part D, and Medicaid programs and receive revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state governments. Funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. An unexpected reduction in government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Our business is subject to routine government scrutiny, and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. We participate in federal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future. 38 Table of Contents State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage determinations; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; and government sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation, or, if enacted, what their terms will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. We typically are involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. In addition, public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services. Relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers are important to our business. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices. A number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws. In any particular market, these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider. To the extent that a capitated provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that are the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. The nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits were filed against UnitedHealthcare and PacifiCare and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business, although all claims against PacifiCare have been dismissed. The suits are 39 Table of Contents purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO . In March 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers. Although the expenses we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action lawsuits and the American Medical Association lawsuit have not been material to our business, we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of these lawsuits and other matters, even if they are without merit. The Company is largely self insured with regard to litigation risks; however, we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize risks associated with catastrophic claims. Although we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters. Although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded. Our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services face regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that may differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products. In connection with the PacifiCare merger, we acquired a pharmacy benefits management business, Prescription Solutions. We also provide pharmacy benefits management services through UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions. Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions are subject to federal and state anti remuneration and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. Federal and state legislatures are considering new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt of rebates from pharmaceutical companies. In addition, if a court were to determine that our PBM business acts as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies, preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs, contracting network practices, speciality drug distribution and other transactions. Our PBM also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our PBM subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties. We also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy. Our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care providers have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. The value of our intangible assets may become impaired. Due largely to our recent acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $18.2 billion as of December 31, 2005, representing approximately 44% of our total assets. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible 40 Table of Contents assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. Our knowledge and information related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services. We must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality. The use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA). HIPAA also imposes guidelines on our business associates (as this term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. Compliance with these proposals, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. The anticipated benefits of acquiring PacifiCare may not be realized. We acquired PacifiCare with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits including, among others, benefits relating to a stronger and more diverse network of doctors and other health care providers, expanded and enhanced affordable health care services, enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for UnitedHealth Group in the Western United States, cross selling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether UnitedHealth Group integrates PacifiCare in an efficient and effective manner and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
