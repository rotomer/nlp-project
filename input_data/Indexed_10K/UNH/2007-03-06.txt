Financial Restatements All of the financial information presented in this Item 7 has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Companys financial results, which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and in Note 3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. The impact under FAS 123R of recognizing additional stock based compensation expense and related tax effects as a result of historic stock option practices as well as immaterial adjustments unrelated to historic stock option practices that were identified through a review of the Companys accounting practices is $43 million ($57 million net of tax) in 2005, $40 million ($44 million net of tax) in 2004, and an aggregate of $453 million ($313 million net of tax) for 2003 and all prior years. The impact under APB 25 of all errors is $304 million ($238 million net of tax) in 2005, $200 million ($158 million net of tax) in 2004, and an aggregate of $1,056 million ($738 million net of tax) for 2003 and all prior years. The Company also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustment would have changed under two alternative methodologies for determining measurement dates. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Stock Option Measurement Dates for details. 30 Table of Contents The following tables illustrate the effect of the restatement adjustments on our pro forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share if we had recorded compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value accounting method as defined by FAS 123 for all stock based awards granted from 1995 to 2003. Refer to Note 3 for an illustration of the effect of the FAS 123R restatement adjustments relating to 2004 and 2005.

The Company achieved diversified growth across its business segments and generated net earnings of $4.2 billion, representing an increase of 35% over 2005. Other financial performance highlights include: Diluted net earnings per common share of $2.97, an increase of 29% over 2005. Consolidated revenues of $71.5 billion, an increase of 54% over 2005, with revenues advancing in each business segment. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased 21% over 2005. Earnings from operations of $7.0 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 37%, over 2005. Operating margin of 9.8%, down from 10.9% in 2005, primarily due to changes in business mix related to the PacifiCare acquisition and the launch of the Medicare Part D program. Cash flows from operations of $6.5 billion, up from $4.1 billion in 2005. 31 Table of Contents 2006 Results Compared to 2005 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues are comprised of premium revenues from risk based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; product revenues; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care services and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. For both premium risk based and fee based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold and from administrative services. Product revenues are recognized upon sale or shipment because the price is fixed and the member may not return the drugs or receive a refund. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix syndicated content products, which are recognized as revenue upon shipment. Consolidated revenues in 2006 of $71.5 billion increased by $25.1 billion, or 54%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 21% in 2006 principally driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program on January 1, 2006, rate increases on premium based and fee based services and growth in individuals served across our business segments. Following is a discussion of 2006 consolidated revenue trends for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues totaled $65.7 billion in 2006, an increase of $23.6 billion, or 56%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, consolidated premium revenues increased by $8.8 billion, or 21%, over 2005. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk based products. UnitedHealthcare premium revenues in 2006 totaled $33.5 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion, or 29%, over 2005. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, UnitedHealthcare premium revenues were essentially flat compared to 2005. This was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products, offset by lower premium yields from new business due primarily to a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high deductible lower premium products (with correspondingly lower medical costs), and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial risk based products due primarily to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2006 totaled $24.4 billion, an increase of $15.2 billion, or 165%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately $8.3 billion, or 92%, over 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. Specialized Care Services premium revenues increased by approximately $1.0 billion over 2005. This was primarily due to the PacifiCare acquisition and strong growth in the number of individuals served by several Specialized Care Services businesses under premium based arrangements. The remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and premium revenue rate increases in AmeriChoices Medicaid programs, which contributed premium revenue increases of approximately $278 million, or 8%, over 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions. 32 Table of Contents Service Revenues Service revenues in 2006 totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of $602 million, or 16%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, service revenues increased by approximately 12% over 2005. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee based arrangements during 2006, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by approximately 23% due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Product Revenues Product revenues in 2006 totaled $737 million, an increase of $579 million over 2005. This was primarily due to pharmacy revenues at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income during 2006 totaled $871 million, representing an increase of $366 million over 2005. Interest income increased by $372 million in 2006, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed income investments during the year, due in part to the acquisition of PacifiCare, as well as higher yields on fixed income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $4 million in 2006, compared with net capital gains of $10 million in 2005. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues). The consolidated medical care ratio increased from 80.0% in 2005 to 81.2% in 2006. This medical care ratio increase resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of PacifiCare and launch of the Medicare Part D program, both of which carry a higher medical care ratio than the historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information and other facts and circumstances, that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2006 include approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2006 was driven by an increase in medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Medical costs for 2006 increased $19.6 billion, or 58%, to $53.3 billion, due to the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program and a medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk based business. Medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program for 2006 were $4.9 billion. Medical trend was due to both medical inflation and increases in health care consumption. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2006 of 14.0%, improved from 15.4% in 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program and the PacifiCare acquisition. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee based revenues. The decrease in the operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration, and an insurance recovery of $43 million. These items were partially offset by a $22 million charitable contribution to the United Health Foundation and approximately $44 million of additional cash expenses related to the stock option review, exclusive of the FAS 123R compensation expense. 33 Table of Contents Operating costs in 2006 totaled $10.0 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 40%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 13% over 2005. This increase was primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program as well as a 4% increase in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise during 2006 (excluding the impact of acquisitions), growth in Specialized Care Services and Ingenix, general operating cost inflation, and the specific items discussed above, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment, cost savings associated with acquisition integrations and other cost management initiatives. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2006 totaled $599 million, an increase of $510 million over 2005. This increase was primarily due to pharmacy sales at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2006 was $670 million, an increase of $217 million, or 48%, over 2005. Approximately $85 million of this increase was related to intangible assets from PacifiCare and other businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. The remaining increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in 2006 and in 2005. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2006 2005 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 64,180 $ 40,023 60% Uniprise 5,451 4,893 11% Specialized Care Services 3,989 2,806 42% Ingenix 976 807 21% Intersegment Eliminations (3,054 ) (2,104 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 71,542 $ 46,425 54% Earnings From Operations 2006 2005 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 5,128 $ 3,664 40% Uniprise 897 740 21% Specialized Care Services 769 541 42% Ingenix 190 135 41% Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 6,984 $ 5,080 37% nm not meaningful 34 Table of Contents Health Care Services The Health Care Services segment is composed of the UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. UnitedHealthcare offers a comprehensive array of consumer oriented health benefit plans and services for local, small and mid sized employers and individuals nationwide. Ovations provides health and well being services to individuals age 50 and older, including the administration of supplemental health insurance coverage on behalf of AARP and the delivery of the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit to beneficiaries throughout the United States. AmeriChoice provides network based health and well being services to state Medicaid, Childrens Health Insurance Programs and other government sponsored health care programs and the beneficiaries of those programs. The financial results of UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice have been combined in the Health Care Services segment column in the tables presented below because these businesses have similar economic characteristics and have similar products and services, types of customers, distribution methods and operational processes, and operate in a similar regulatory environment, typically within the same legal entity. Health Care Services had revenues of $64.2 billion in 2006, representing an increase of $24.2 billion, or 60%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $8.9 billion, or 23%, over 2005. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $35.2 billion in 2006 increased by $8.0 billion, or 29%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased by approximately 1% over 2005 due to an increase in the number of individuals served with commercial fee based products as well as average premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products, offset by lower premium yields from a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high deductible lower premium products (with correspondingly lower medical costs) and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial risk based products due primarily to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee based products. Ovations revenues of $25.3 billion in 2006 increased by approximately $15.9 billion, or 168% over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations revenues increased by $8.4 billion, or 91%, over 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to an 8% increase in AmeriChoice revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions, driven primarily by membership growth and premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2006 were $5.1 billion, representing an increase of $1.5 billion, or 40%, over 2005. This increase was principally driven by acquisitions and increases in the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare and Part D products and UnitedHealthcares fee based products. The segment also benefited by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration. UnitedHealthcares commercial medical care ratio increased to 79.8% in 2006 from 78.6% in 2005, mainly due to the impact of the PacifiCare acquisition and changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services operating margin for 2006 was 8.0%, a decrease from 9.2% in 2005. This decrease was driven mainly by the acquisition of PacifiCare and the new Medicare Part D program, which have lower operating margins than historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31 (1): (in thousands) 2006 2005 Commercial Risk based 10,040 10,105 Fee based 4,735 3,990 Total Commercial 14,775 14,095 Medicare Advantage 1,410 1,150 Medicare Part D Stand alone 4,500 Medicaid 1,425 1,250 Total Health Care Services 22,110 16,495 (1) Excludes individuals served by Ovations Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members as well as Medicare institutional and Medicaid long term care members. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial business as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately 680,000, or 5%, over the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, commercial business individuals served increased by 185,000, or 1%, over the prior year. This included an increase of approximately 660,000 in the number of individuals served with commercial fee based products, driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk based products to fee based products, offset by a decrease of approximately 475,000 in the number of individuals served with commercial risk based products due primarily to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee based products. Excluding acquisitions, the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare Advantage products increased by 230,000, or 20%, from 2005 due primarily to new customer relationships. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, AmeriChoices Medicaid enrollment increased 65,000, or 5%, primarily due to new customer gains. Uniprise Uniprise provides network based health and well being services, business to business transaction processing services, consumer connectivity and technology support services nationwide to large employers and health plans, and provides health related consumer and financial transaction products and services. Uniprise revenues in 2006 were $5.5 billion, representing an increase of $558 million, or 11%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Uniprise revenues increased 7% over 2005. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self insured customers. Uniprise served 10.9 million individuals and 10.5 million individuals as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations for 2006 were $897 million, representing an increase of $157 million, or 21%, over 2005. Operating margin for 2006 improved to 16.5% for 2006 from 15.1% in 2005. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Additionally, Uniprises infrastructure can be scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services offers a comprehensive platform of specialty health, wellness and ancillary benefits, networks, services and resources to specific customer markets nationwide. Specialized Care Services revenues of 36 Table of Contents $4.0 billion increased by $1.2 billion, or 42%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased by 22% over the prior periods. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. Earnings from operations in 2006 of $769 million increased $228 million, or 42%, over 2005. Specialized Care Services operating margin was 19.3% in 2006 and 2005. Realized improvements in operating cost structure and benefits from the integration of PacifiCare specialty operations in 2006 were offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products. Ingenix Ingenix offers database and data management services, software products, publications, consulting services, outsourced services and pharmaceutical development and consulting services on a national and international basis. Ingenix revenues for 2006 of $976 million increased by $169 million, or 21%, over 2005. This was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses, as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Earnings from operations in 2006 were $190 million, up $55 million, or 41%, from 2005. Operating margin was 19.5% in 2006, up from 16.7% in 2005. These increases in earnings from operations and operating margin were primarily due to growth in the health information and pharmaceutical services businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. 2005 Results Compared to 2004 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues in 2005 increased by $8.2 billion, or 21%, to $46.4 billion. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 11% in 2005 primarily as a result of rate increases on premium based and fee based services and growth in individuals served across business segments. Following is a discussion of 2005 consolidated revenue trends for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues totaled $42.1 billion in 2005, an increase of $7.7 billion, or 22%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, consolidated premium revenues increased by approximately 11% over 2004. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and a modest increase in the number of individuals served by our risk based products. UnitedHealthcare premium revenues in 2005 totaled $25.9 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, UnitedHealthcare premium revenues increased by approximately 9% over 2004. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products. In addition, Ovations premium revenues in 2005 totaled $9.2 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately 20% over 2004, driven primarily by an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products and by Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members, as well as rate increases on these products. Premium revenues from AmeriChoices Medicaid programs in 2005 totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $270 million, or 9%, over 2004 driven primarily by premium rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase is due mainly to strong growth in the number of individuals served by several Specialized Care Services businesses under premium based arrangements. Service Revenues Service revenues in 2005 totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of $423 million, or 13%, over 2004. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals 37 Table of Contents served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee based arrangements during 2005, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by 16% due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Product Revenues Product revenues in 2005 totaled $158 million, an increase of $36 million over 2004. This was primarily due to pharmacy revenues at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare, and increased revenues associated with the interim government sponsored drug card program. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $505 million, representing an increase of $92 million over 2004. Interest income increased by $126 million in 2005, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed income investments during the year due to the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI as well as higher yields on fixed income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $10 million in 2005, a decrease of $34 million from 2004. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 80.9% in 2004 to 80.0% in 2005. This medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from changes in product, business and customer mix and an increase in favorable medical cost development related to prior periods. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information, that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. On an absolute dollar basis, 2005 medical costs totaled $33.7 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion, or 21%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 9% driven primarily by a medical cost trend of 7% to 8% due to both inflation and an increase in health care consumption as well as organic growth. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2005 was 15.4%, down from 15.9% in 2004. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee based revenues. Additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2005 totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 17%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 11%. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in total individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise during 2005 (excluding the impact of acquisitions), growth in Specialized Care Services and Ingenix and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2005 totaled $89 million, an increase of $35 million over 2004. This was primarily due to pharmacy sales at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare, and increased costs associated with sales under the interim government sponsored drug card program. 38 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2005 was $453 million, an increase of $79 million, or 21%, over 2004. Approximately $32 million of this increase was related to intangible assets from business acquisitions since the beginning of 2004. The remaining increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements and business growth. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in 2005, compared to 35.4% in 2004. The increase was mainly driven by favorable settlements of prior year tax returns during 2004 and an increase in 2005 state taxes. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2005 2004 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 40,023 $ 32,681 22% Uniprise 4,893 4,318 13% Specialized Care Services 2,806 2,296 22% Ingenix 807 707 14% Intersegment Eliminations (2,104 ) (1,785 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 46,425 $ 38,217 21% Earnings From Operations 2005 2004 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 3,664 $ 2,688 36% Uniprise 740 624 19% Specialized Care Services 541 445 22% Ingenix 135 101 34% Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 5,080 $ 3,858 32% nm not meaningful Health Care Services Health Care Services had revenues of $40.0 billion in 2005, representing an increase of $7.3 billion, or 22%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $3.0 billion, or 11%, over 2004. UnitedHealthcare accounted for approximately $1.6 billion of this increase, driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products. Ovations contributed approximately $1.2 billion to the revenue advance over 2004 largely attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members and by its Medicare Advantage products as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to an 8% increase in AmeriChoices revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions, driven primarily by premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. 39 Table of Contents Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2005 were $3.7 billion, representing an increase of $976 million, or 36%, over 2004. This increase primarily resulted from revenue growth and improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcares risk based products, increases in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial fee based products, and the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI during 2004. UnitedHealthcares commercial medical care ratio decreased to 78.6% in 2005 from 79.3% in 2004 mainly due to changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services 2005 operating margin was 9.2%, an increase from 8.2% in 2004. This increase was driven mainly by the lower commercial medical care ratio as well as changes in business and customer mix. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31 (1): (in thousands) 2005 (2) 2004 Commercial Risk based 10,105 7,655 Fee based 3,990 3,305 Total Commercial 14,095 10,960 Medicare Advantage 1,150 330 Medicaid 1,250 1,260 Total Health Care Services 16,495 12,550 (1) Excludes individuals served by Ovations Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members as well as Medicare institutional and Medicaid long term care members. (2) Includes commercial risk based membership of 2.34 million, commercial fee based membership of 95,000 and Medicare membership of 755,000 related to the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcares commercial business as of December 31, 2005, excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, increased by approximately 700,000 over the prior year. This included an increase of 590,000 in the number of individuals served with fee based products driven by the addition of approximately 335,000 individuals served resulting from new customer relationships and customers converting from risk based products to fee based products as well as approximately 255,000 individuals served by a benefits administrative services company acquired in December 2005. In addition, the number of individuals served with commercial risk based products increased by 110,000 driven primarily by the addition of approximately 130,000 individuals served by Neighborhood Health Partnership, acquired in September 2005, and a slight increase in net new customer relationships more than offset by customers converting from risk based products to fee based products. Excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare Advantage products increased by 65,000, or 20%, over 2004 due primarily to new customer relationships. AmeriChoices Medicaid enrollment decreased by 10,000 from 2004 due primarily to the withdrawal of participation in one market during the third quarter of 2005 partially offset by new customer relationships since 2004. Uniprise Uniprise revenues in 2005 were $4.9 billion, representing an increase of $575 million, or 13%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Uniprise revenues increased approximately 11% over 2004. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 7% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self insured customers. Uniprise served 10.5 million individuals and 9.9 million individuals as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations in 2005 were $740 million, representing an increase of $116 million, or 19%, over 2004. Operating margin for 2005 improved to 15.1% from 14.5% in 2004. Uniprise has expanded its 40 Table of Contents operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Additionally, Uniprises infrastructure can be scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services revenues of $2.8 billion increased by $510 million, or 22%, over 2004. This increase was principally driven by an 11% increase in the number of individuals served by its specialty benefit businesses, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and rate increases related to these businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 of $541 million increased $96 million, or 22%, over 2004. Specialized Care Services operating margin was 19.3% in 2005, down from 19.4% in 2004. This decrease was due to a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by continued gains in quality initiatives and operating cost efficiencies. Ingenix Ingenix 2005 revenues of $807 million increased by $100 million, or 14%, over 2004. This was driven primarily by growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 were $135 million, up $34 million, or 34%, from 2004. Ingenixs operating margin was 16.7% in 2005, up from 14.3% in 2004. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2006 Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short term obligations in longer term, investment grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. Factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our Board of Directors approved investment policy, regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. Our long term investments are also available for sale to meet short term liquidity and other needs. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending 41 Table of Contents on market conditions. In August 2006, we announced that we would not purchase shares under our stock repurchase program until we had completed our restatement (which is reflected in this Form 10 K) and become current in our periodic SEC filings. As a result, we did not repurchase any shares through this publicly announced program for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from net earnings, prior to depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with estimated future health care costs. In 2006, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $170 million. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk. However, a significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for the Company or limit the Companys access to capital. See Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices Credit Ratings for additional information. Cash and Investments Cash flows from operating activities were $6.5 billion in 2006, an increase over $4.1 billion in 2005. The increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of $1.3 billion in net income prior to depreciation, amortization and other noncash items as well as an increase of approximately $1.1 billion in cash flows generated from working capital changes. We generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of $1.6 billion in 2006 and $412 million in 2005. The year over year increase primarily resulted from the Company receiving twelve monthly Medicare premium payments during 2006 from CMS rather than the eleven monthly payments received in 2005, positively impacting the change in reported operating cash flows by $275 million, along with growth in medical payables during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily driven by overall growth of the insured business. Additionally, there was an increase in accrued taxes payable due largely to an increase in pre tax earnings. We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with cash and investments of $20.6 billion at December 31, 2006. Total cash and investments increased by $5.6 billion since December 31, 2005, primarily due to strong operating cash flows, cash received from debt and common stock issuances, and cash and investments acquired through businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006, partially offset by common stock repurchases, cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures. As further described under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. At December 31, 2006, approximately $1.9 billion of our $20.6 billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases. Financing and Investing Activities In addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities, we use commercial paper and long term debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had commercial paper and long term debt outstanding of approximately $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. Our debt to total capital ratio was 26.4% and 28.5% as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, 42 Table of Contents respectively. We believe the prudent use of debt optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, our outstanding commercial paper had interest rates of approximately 5.3% to 5.5%. On December 1, 2006, our Health Care Services business segment acquired the Student Insurance Division (Student Resources) of The MEGA Life and Health Insurance Company through an asset purchase agreement. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, we issued a 10 year, 5.4% promissory note for approximately $95 million and paid approximately $1 million in cash in exchange for the net assets of Student Resources. On February 24, 2006, our Health Care Services business segment acquired John Deere Health Care, Inc. (JDHC). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $515 million in cash, including transaction costs, in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of JDHC. We issued commercial paper to finance the JDHC purchase price. JDHC has been renamed UnitedHealthcare Services Company of the River Valley, Inc. On December 20, 2005, the Company acquired PacifiCare. Under the terms of the agreement, PacifiCare shareholders received 1.1 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $21.50 in cash for each share of PacifiCare common stock they owned. Total consideration issued for the transaction was approximately $8.8 billion, composed of approximately 99.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $5.3 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of July 6, 2005), approximately $2.1 billion in cash, $960 million in cash paid to retire PacifiCares existing debt and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately $420 million issued in exchange for PacifiCares outstanding vested common stock options. On September 19, 2005, our Health Care Services business segment acquired Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $185 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of NHP. We issued commercial paper to finance the NHP purchase price. On October 16, 2006, we executed a $7.5 billion 364 day revolving credit facility in order to ensure the Companys immediate and continued access to additional liquidity, if necessary. The credit facility is available for working capital purposes as well as to pay or repay any outstanding borrowings of the Company. We have entered into amendments to this credit facility to provide us with additional time to deliver to the lenders this 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 and our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under our $7.5 billion credit facility. In March 2006, we refinanced outstanding commercial paper by issuing $650 million of floating rate notes due March 2009, $750 million of 5.3% fixed rate notes due March 2011, $750 million of 5.4% fixed rate notes due March 2016 and $850 million of 5.8% fixed rate notes due March 2036. The floating rate notes due March 2009 are benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and had an interest rate of 5.5% at December 31, 2006. In December 2005, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion five year revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program. We increased the credit facility to $1.3 billion and extended the maturity date to December 2010. We entered into amendments to our $1.3 billion credit facility to provide us with additional time to deliver to the lenders our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 and our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006, to obtain our lenders agreement and acknowledgement that the delivery of a notice of default or notice of acceleration under any indenture or credit agreement that is being contested by the Company in good faith does not cause a default or event of default under the credit agreement, and to obtain a waiver of any potential default that may arise as a result of our determination that our historical financial information should not be relied upon and as a result of 43 Table of Contents our restatement of our historical financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under our $1.3 billion credit facility. In November and December 2005, we issued $2.6 billion of commercial paper primarily to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of the PacifiCare acquisition described above and to retire a portion of the PacifiCare debt at the closing of the acquisition, as well as to refinance current maturities of long term debt. In October 2005, we executed a $3.0 billion 364 day revolving credit facility to support a $3.0 billion increase in our commercial paper program in order to finance the cash portion of the PacifiCare acquisition. We terminated the 364 day revolving credit facility in March 2006. In March 2005, we issued $500 million of 4.9% fixed rate notes due March 2015. We used the proceeds from this borrowing for general corporate purposes, including repayment of commercial paper, capital expenditures, working capital and share repurchases. To more closely align interest costs with the floating interest rate received on our cash and cash equivalent balances, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges. The interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2006 with variable rates that are benchmarked to LIBOR, and are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate liability, recorded at fair value, for all existing interest rate swaps was approximately $73 million. These fair value hedges are accounted for using the short cut method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), whereby the hedges are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and the carrying value of the long term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Since these amounts completely offset, we have reported both the swap liability and the debt liability within debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and there have been no net gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2006, the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 4.9% to 5.7%. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and long term debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, long term debt and shareholders equity) below 50%. After giving effect to the credit agreement amendments and waivers that we obtained from our lenders, we believe we are in compliance with the requirements of our debt covenants. On August 28, 2006 we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold certain of our debt securities alleging a violation of our indenture governing our debt securities. This followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. On or about November 2, 2006, we received a purported notice of acceleration from the holders who previously sent the notice of default that purports to declare an acceleration of our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 as a result of our not filing our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Our indenture requires us to provide to the trustee copies of the reports we are required to file with the SEC, such as our quarterly reports, within 15 days of filing such reports with the SEC. On October 25, 2006, we filed an action in the United States District Federal Court for the District of Minnesota seeking a declaratory judgment that we are not in default under the terms of the indenture. Immediately prior to the filing of this Form 10 K, we filed our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, as well as an amendment to our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Should the Company ultimately be unsuccessful in this matter, the Company may be required to retire all or a portion of the $850 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due March 2036. We intend to prosecute the declaratory judgment action vigorously. PacifiCare had approximately $100 million par value of 3% convertible subordinated debentures (convertible notes), which were convertible into approximately 5.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Groups common stock and $102 million of cash as of December 31, 2005. In December 2005, we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected 44 Table of Contents to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture governing the convertible notes. The compensation consisted of the present value of interest through October 18, 2007, the earliest redemption date, plus a pro rata share of $1 million. On January 31, 2006, approximately 91% of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer, for which we issued 4.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock, valued at $282 million, and cash of $93 million. Our senior debt is rated A with a negative outlook by Standard & Poors (S&P), A with a negative watch by Fitch, and A3 with a negative outlook by Moodys. Our commercial paper is rated A 1 with a negative outlook by S&P, F 1 with a negative watch by Fitch, and P 2 with a negative outlook by Moodys. Moodys downgraded our rating in October 2006 citing concerns about corporate governance following the release of the WilmerHale Report (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We do not expect this Moodys downgrade to significantly affect our borrowing capacity or costs. A significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. See Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices Credit Ratings for additional information. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 40.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $56 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we had Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 136.7 million shares of our common stock. Our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital. The Company suspended purchases under its stock repurchase program in the third quarter of 2006 pending completion of our restatement (which is reflected in this Form 10 K) and becoming current in our periodic SEC filings. The Company intends to resume its stock repurchase program in 2007. We currently have $1.0 billion remaining under our universal S 3 shelf registration statement (for common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities), although we will be unable to issue securities on Form S 3 on a primary basis until we have timely filed all reports required to be filed with the SEC for a twelve month period. We may offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering. Under our S 4 acquisition shelf registration statement, we have remaining issuing capacity of 48.6 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities. We filed a separate S 4 registration statement for the 99.2 million shares issued in connection with the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare described previously. Contractual Obligations, Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Commitments The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2006, under our various contractual obligations, off balance sheet arrangements and commitments (in millions): 2007 2008 to 2009 2010 to 2011 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper (1) $ 1,483 $ 1,850 $ 750 $ 3,373 $ 7,456 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper (2) 366 581 438 1,660 3,045 Operating Leases 156 273 167 370 966 Purchase Obligations (3) 182 144 30 5 361 Future Policy Benefits (4) 121 339 325 1,186 1,971 Other Long Term Obligations (5) 74 12 325 399 Total Contractual Obligations $ 2,308 $ 3,261 $ 1,722 $ 6,919 $ 14,210 (1) Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of acceleration is remote. (2) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2006 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. 45 Table of Contents (3) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. (4) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay (See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The payable is offset by a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica. (5) Includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments. The table above includes a facility lease agreement that we signed in 2006. Lease payments are expected to commence under this agreement in March 2009, at the time we occupy the facility, and extend over a 20 year period with total estimated lease payments of $229 million. In conjunction with the PacifiCare acquisition we committed to make $50 million in charitable contributions to the benefit of California health care consumers, which has been accrued on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, we agreed to invest $200 million in Californias health care infrastructure to further health care services to the underserved populations of the California marketplace. The timing and amount of individual contributions and investments are at our discretion, subject to the advice and oversight of local regulatory authorities; however, our goal is to have the investment commitment fully funded by the end of 2010. The investment commitment remains in place for 20 years after full funding. We have committed to specific projects totaling $12 million of the $50 million charitable commitment at this time. Due to the financial restatements previously discussed, the Company has determined that certain options exercised by nonexecutive officer employees in 2006 were discount options subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company notified the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on February 28, 2007 that it would participate in the IRSs resolution program which allows the Company to pay its employees additional tax costs under Section 409A. As such, the Company will take a charge, net of tax benefit, of approximately $55 million in the first quarter of 2007. Currently, we do not have any other material contractual obligations, off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract Beginning January 1, 2006, the Company began serving as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under a contract with CMS. The Company contracts with CMS on an annual basis. Under Medicare Part D, members have access to a standard drug benefit that features a monthly premium, typically with an initial annual deductible, coinsurance of 25% for the member and 75% for the Company up to an initial coverage limit of $2,250 of annual drug costs, no insurance coverage between $2,250 and $5,100 (except the member gets the benefit of the Companys significant drug discounts), and catastrophic coverage for annual drug costs in excess of $5,100 covered approximately 80% by CMS, 15% by the Company and 5% by the member up to an annual out of pocket maximum of $3,600. The Companys contract with CMS includes risk sharing provisions, wherein CMS retains approximately 75% to 80% of the losses or profits outside a pre defined risk corridor. The risk sharing provisions take effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than 2.5% above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the Company in its initial contract application. 46 Table of Contents During 2006, members were permitted to enroll or disenroll in a Medicare Part D plan until May 15, 2006. Once enrolled, most members were allowed to switch plans once before May 15, 2006 (although low income members eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid are allowed to change plans monthly). Contracts are generally non cancelable by enrollees after May 15, 2006. After that date, enrollees may change plans once every year between November 15 and December 31 to take effect January 1 of the following year. As a result of the Medicare Part D benefit design, the Company incurs benefit costs unevenly during the annual contract year. While the Company is responsible for a majority of a Medicare members drug costs up to $2,250, the member is responsible for their drug costs from $2,250 up to $5,100 (at the Companys discounted purchase price). As such, the Company incurs disproportionately higher benefit claims in the first half of the contract year as compared with last half of the contract year, when comparatively more members will be incurring claims above the $2,250 initial coverage limit. Although the Company also incurs costs for individuals with annual pharmacy claims in excess of $5,100, these costs represent a much smaller portion of total contract costs, and will be incurred primarily in the second half of the year. The uneven timing of Medicare Part D pharmacy benefit claims results in losses in the first half of year that entitle the Company to risk share adjustment payments from CMS. Accordingly, during the interim periods within the contract year we record a net risk share receivable from CMS in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This represents the estimated amount payable by CMS to the Company under the risk share contract provisions if the program were terminated based on estimated costs incurred through that interim period. Those losses reverse in the second half of the year and final risk share amounts due to or from CMS, if any, are settled approximately six months after the contract year end. The projected net risk share payable to be paid to CMS as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $350 million. AARP In January 1998, we entered into a ten year contract with AARP to provide health insurance products and services to members of AARP. These products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional Medicare (Medicare Supplement insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, health insurance focused on persons between 50 to 64 years of age, and other products. Under the terms of this Medicare Supplement insurance contract, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. We are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program. Premium revenues from these AARP Supplemental Health Insurance offerings were approximately $5.0 billion in 2006, $4.9 billion in 2005 and $4.5 billion in 2004. The underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF). The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member services expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we would have to fund the deficit. Any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. As further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the RSF balance at December 31, 2006 is currently sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks associated with the contract. Under a separate license agreement with AARP, we sell Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plans under the AARP brand name. We assume all operational and underwriting risks and losses for these plans. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to standards established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). These standards, among other things, require 47 Table of Contents these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. We maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require. In 2006, based on 2005 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was approximately $2.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid over $2.5 billion in dividends to their parent companies, including approximately $300 million of special dividends approved by state insurance regulators. The inability of the Companys regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies would impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures, business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, the inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt; however, our cash flows from operating activities generated from our non regulated businesses greatly mitigate this risk. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.9 billion of our $20.6 billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and available for general corporate use. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have either not yet received or processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. Depending on the health care provider and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. 48 Table of Contents In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36 month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the Company as of the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. We do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors. Accordingly, for the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider completion factors in developing medical cost estimates for the most recent months. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2006: Completion Factor Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (1) (in millions) (0.75)% $ 126 (0.50)% $ 84 (0.25)% $ 42 0.25% $ (42 ) 0.50% $ (84 ) 0.75% $ (126 ) Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical costs payable for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2006: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) in Medical Costs Payable (2) (in millions) 3% $ 247 2% $ 165 1% $ 82 (1)% $ (82 ) (2)% $ (165 ) (3)% $ (247 ) (1) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical cost payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. (2) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in medical costs PMPM trend data used in developing medical cost payable estimates for the most recent three months. 49 Table of Contents The analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on the Companys historical experience in estimating its liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations (in millions). FavorableDevelopment Increase (Decrease) to Medical Costs(a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations As Restated (b) As Adjusted (c) As Restated (b) As Adjusted 2002 $ 70 $ (80 ) $ 18,938 $ 18,858 $ 1,969 $ 2,049 2003 $ 150 $ (60 ) $ 21,482 $ 21,422 $ 2,671 $ 2,731 2004 $ 210 $ (190 ) $ 27,858 $ 27,668 $ 3,858 $ 4,048 2005 $ 400 $ (30 ) $ 33,669 $ 33,639 $ 5,080 $ 5,110 2006 $ 430 (d ) $ 53,308 (d ) $ 6,984 (d ) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year. (b) Restated to include the impact of FAS 123R, which we adopted effective January 1, 2006, as well as impacts associated with the restatement described in Note 3 Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (d) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2007 will change as our December 31, 2006 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2007. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of the Companys liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2006, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the Companys liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2006; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2006 was driven primarily by growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. As our medical costs payable estimate increases in amount due to increases in the fully insured consumer base and inflationary increases in medical costs, the absolute dollar amount of subsequent changes to that estimate will increase even if the accuracy of our medical costs payable estimate remains consistent as a percentage of the original estimate. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2006 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding the AARP business, 2006 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $71 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.03 per share. Historic Stock Option Measurement Dates The selection by the Company of the methodologies described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to determine the measurement dates of historic stock option grants involved judgment and careful evaluation of all relevant facts and circumstances for each historical grant. The Company believes it has used the most appropriate methodologies. However, the Company also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustments would have changed under two alternative methodologies for determining measurement dates. The following table sets forth the incremental effect on earnings before income taxes that would result from using the alternate measurement date determination methodologies described below: Communication Date. This methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which stock option grants were communicated to employees, assuming that the communication date is readily 50 Table of Contents identifiable. This was generally the date on which stock option awards became viewable by all optionees on the Companys intranet portal for employee benefits. In the event the communication date was not readily available, with respect to Section 16 officers, this alternative methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which a Section 16 officer filed a Form 4 (or other statement of changes in beneficial ownership) with respect to a specific grant and, for employees who are not Section 16 officers, the date on which the Company has determined that the CEO Certificate was likely executed by the former CEO of the Company. Legal Execution Date. This methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which the Company has determined that the legal documentation approving a grant was likely executed, based on evaluation of all available information. For Section 16 Officers, this date is typically the date on which the Company has determined that the Written Action of the Compensation Committee was likely executed by a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee and, for all other employees, this date is typically the date on which the Company has determined that the CEO Certificate was likely executed by the former CEO of the Company.

We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2006, we had long lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, property, equipment and capitalized software, of $20.6 billion. We review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in 51 Table of Contents circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. Investments As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $10.3 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2006, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $79 million and gross unrealized losses of $53 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investments fair value is other than temporary. We analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. See Cautionary Statements for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation. Inflation The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers. Through contracts with physicians and other health care providers, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. 52 Table of Contents Legal Matters Legal Matters Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices Regulatory Inquiries In March 2006, we received an informal inquiry from the SEC relating to our historic stock option practices. On May 17, 2006, we received a document request from the Internal Revenue Service seeking documents relating to stock option grants and other compensation for the persons who from 2003 to the present were the named executive officers in our annual proxy statements. On May 17, 2006, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York requesting documents from 1999 to the present relating to our stock option practices. On June 6, 2006, we received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Minnesota Attorney General requesting documents from January 1, 1997 to the present concerning our executive compensation and stock option practices. After filing an action in Ramsey County Court, State of Minnesota, captioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated vs. State of Minnesota, by Lori Swanson, Attorney General, we filed a Motion for Protective Order which was denied by the trial court. We are pursuing an appeal of the Order denying the Protective Order. On December 19, 2006, we received from the staff of the SEC Enforcement Division a formal order of investigation into the Companys historic stock option practices. We have also received requests for documents from U.S. Congressional committees relating to our historic stock option practices and compensation of executives. With the exception of the Civil Investigative Demand from the Minnesota Attorney General, we have generally cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the regulatory authorities. At the conclusion of these regulatory inquiries, we could be subject to regulatory or criminal fines or penalties, as well as other sanctions or other contingent liabilities, which could be material. Litigation Matters On March 29, 2006, the first of several shareholder derivative actions was filed against certain of our current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The action has been consolidated with six other actions and is captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Shareholder Derivative Litigation. The consolidated amended complaint is brought on behalf of the Company by several pension funds and other shareholders and names certain of our current and former directors and officers as defendants, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. The consolidated amended complaint generally alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, were unjustly enriched, and violated the securities laws in connection with our historic stock option practices. The consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified money damages, injunctive relief and rescission of the options. On June 26, 2006, our Board of Directors created a Special Litigation Committee under Minnesota Statute 302A.241, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, with the power to investigate the claims raised in the derivative actions and a shareholder demand, and determine whether the Companys rights and remedies should be pursued. Based on the existence of our Special Litigation Committee, defendants have moved to dismiss or in the alternative to stay the litigation pending resolution of the Special Litigation Committee process. A consolidated derivative action, reflecting a consolidation of two actions, is also pending in Hennepin County District Court, State of Minnesota. The consolidated complaint is captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Derivative Litigation. The action was brought by two individual shareholders and names certain of our current and former officers and directors as defendants, as well as the Company as nominal defendant. On February 6, 2007, the State Court Judge entered an order staying the action pending resolution of the Special Litigation Committee process. On May 5, 2006, the first of seven putative class actions alleging a violation of the federal securities laws was brought by an individual shareholder against certain of our current and former officers and directors in the United 53 Table of Contents States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On December 8, 2006, a consolidated amended complaint was filed consolidating the actions into a single action. The action is captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated PSLRA Litigation. The action was brought by lead plaintiff California Public Employees Retirement System against the Company and certain of our current and former officers and directors. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that defendants, in connection with the same alleged course of conduct identified in the shareholder derivative actions described above, made misrepresentations and omissions during the period between January 20, 2005 and May 17, 2006, in press releases and public filings that artificially inflated the price of our common stock. The consolidated amended complaint also asserts that during the class period, certain defendants sold shares of our common stock while in possession of material, non public information concerning the matters set forth in the complaint. The consolidated amended complaint alleges claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), 20(a) and 20A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The action seeks unspecified money damages and equitable relief. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on February 6, 2007. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. On June 6, 2006, a purported class action captioned Zilhaver v. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, was filed against the Company and certain of our current and former officers and directors in the United State District Court for the District of Minnesota. This action alleges that the fiduciaries to the Company sponsored 401(k) plan violated ERISA by allowing the plan to continue to hold Company stock. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 6, 2007. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. On August 28, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold certain of our debt securities alleging a violation of our indenture governing our debt securities. This follows our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. On October 25, 2006, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, captioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated v. Cede & Co. and the Bank of New York, seeking a declaratory judgment that we are not in default under the terms of the indenture. On or about November 2, 2006, we received a purported notice of acceleration from the holders who previously sent the notice of default that purports to declare an acceleration of our 5.80% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 as a result of our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Immediately prior to the filing of this Form 10 K, we filed our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, as well as an amendment to our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Should the Company ultimately be unsuccessful in this matter, we may be required to retire all or a portion of the $850 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due March 2036. We intend to vigorously prosecute the declaratory judgment action. Other Legal Matters Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. We record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters. These matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. Beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against both UnitedHealthcare and PacifiCare, and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. In December 2000, a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving the Company and our affiliates in the Southern District Court of Florida, Miami division. Generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of ERISA and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits. Other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. The trial court granted the health care providers motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the class action status of the RICO claims, but reversed as to the 54 Table of Contents breach of contract, unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims. During the course of the litigation, there have been co defendant settlements. On January 31, 2006, the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against PacifiCare, and on June 19, 2006, the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against UnitedHealthcare brought by the lead plaintiff. The tag along lawsuits remain outstanding. On July 27, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the dismissal of the claims against UnitedHealthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. On March 15, 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. On April 13, 2000, we removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes of action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest payments. An amended complaint was filed on August 25, 2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class and a non ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA claims and the claims brought by the American Medical Association, a third amended complaint was filed on January 11, 2002. On October 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On May 21, 2003, we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the American Medical Association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff. On May 26, 2004, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based, in part, due to lack of standing. On July 16, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking to assert RICO violations. On December 29, 2006, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices. The Companys primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long term debt. Approximately $20.3 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2006 were debt securities. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed income investment portfolio at December 31, 2006, the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $337 million. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. To mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short term investments. Including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $6.1 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and approximately $1.4 billion had fixed rates as of December 31, 2006. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt. At December 31, 2006, we had $312 million of equity investments, a portion of which were held by our UnitedHealth Capital business in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio. Concentrations of Credit Risk Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject UnitedHealth Group to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under 55 Table of Contents an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As discussed more fully in Note 5 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our life and annuity business. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2006, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. Cautionary Statements The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believes, anticipates, expects, plans, seeks, intends, will likely result, estimates, projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward looking statements about future results. Any or all forward looking statements in this Form 10 K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices Matters relating to or arising out of our historic stock option practices, including regulatory inquiries, litigation matters, downgrades in our credit ratings, and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company. As described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 3 Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K, in early 2006, our Board of Directors initiated an independent review of the Companys stock option practices from 1994 to 2005. The independent review was conducted by the Independent Committee with the assistance of independent counsel, WilmerHale, and independent accounting advisors. On October 15, 2006, we announced that the Independent Committee and WilmerHale had completed their review of the Companys stock option practices and reported the findings to the non management directors of the Company. As a result of our historic stock option practices, we restated, in this Form 10 K, our previously filed financial statements, we are subject to various regulatory inquiries, litigation matters and credit rating downgrades, and we may be subject to further cash and noncash charges, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 56 Table of Contents Regulatory Inquiries The SEC is conducting a formal investigation into the Companys historic stock option practices. In May 2006, the Company received a request from the Internal Revenue Service seeking documents relating to stock option grants and other compensation for the persons who from 2003 to the present were named executive officers in the Companys annual proxy statements. We also received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in May 2006 requesting documents from 1999 to the present relating to the Companys historic stock option practices. In June 2006, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Minnesota Attorney General requesting documents from January 1, 1997 to the present concerning the Companys executive compensation and historic stock option practices. We have also received document requests from U.S. Congressional committees in connection with these issues. We have not resolved any of these matters. We cannot provide assurance that the Company will not be subject to adverse publicity, regulatory or criminal fines or penalties, as well as other sanctions or other contingent liabilities or adverse customer reactions in connection with these matters. See Item 7 Legal Matters for a more detailed description of these inquiries and document requests. Litigation Matters We and certain of our current and former directors and officers are defendants in a consolidated federal securities class action, an ERISA class action, and state and federal shareholder derivative actions relating to our historic stock option practices. We also have received several shareholder demands relating to our historic stock option practices. Our Board of Directors has designated an unaffiliated Special Litigation Committee, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, to investigate the claims raised in the derivative actions and shareholder demands, and determine whether the claims should be pursued. In addition, following our announcement that we would delay filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold certain of our debt securities alleging a violation of the indenture governing our debt securities. Subsequently, we filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is not in default under the terms of the indenture. The Company subsequently received a purported notice of acceleration from these holders who previously sent the notice of default that purports to declare an acceleration of the Companys 5.80% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036, of which an aggregate of $850 million principal amount is outstanding. In connection with the departure of William W. McGuire, M.D., our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we received an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota in November 2006 granting a joint motion for temporary injunctive relief made by plaintiffs and Dr. McGuire. According to the order, Dr. McGuire is preliminarily enjoined from exercising any Company stock options without Court approval, and the Company and Dr. McGuire are preliminarily enjoined from taking any further action pursuant to or having any effect on Dr. McGuires employment agreement, as amended, and other related agreements, and while the preliminary injunction is in effect, no payments will be made to Dr. McGuire under these agreements, including any payments under Dr. McGuires Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan. These actions are in preliminary stages, and we cannot provide assurance that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 7 Legal Matters for a more detailed description of these proceedings and shareholder demands. In addition, we may be subject to additional litigation or other proceedings or actions arising out of the Independent Committees review, the Special Litigation Committees review and the related restatement of our historical financial statements. Litigation and any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 57 Table of Contents Credit Ratings As a result of their concerns related to our historic stock option practices, Moodys downgraded our A2 senior debt rating to A3 with a negative outlook in October 2006 and AM Best downgraded our financial strength ratings from A+ to A with a negative outlook in November 2006. Standard & Poors and FitchRatings confirmed their existing ratings and their negative outlook (Standard & Poors) and negative watch (FitchRatings) on the Companys ratings. If our business results deteriorate significantly, or if there is an event, outcome or action as a result of the regulatory inquiries and document requests or the pending civil litigation, which is materially adverse to the Company, our credit ratings may be further downgraded. A significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for the Company or limit the Companys access to capital. Potential Additional Cash and Noncash Charges As described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 3 Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K, the Company, after completing its internal review of the accounting treatment of all stock option grants and after consultation with the SECs Office of the Chief Accountant on certain interpretive accounting issues, recorded additional cash and noncash stock based compensation expenses, and related tax effects, with regard to certain past stock option grants, and restated previously filed financial statements included in this Form 10 K. While we believe we have made appropriate judgments in determining the financial and tax impacts of our historic stock option practices, we cannot provide assurance that the SEC or the IRS will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial and tax impacts. If the SEC or the IRS disagrees with our financial or tax adjustments and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements, we may have to further restate our prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, other adjustments for non operating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock option related matters arising under litigation, and regulatory reviews by the SEC, IRS, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Congressional committees and Minnesota Attorney General, the amount and timing of which are uncertain but which could be material. Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Business We must effectively manage our health care costs. Under our risk based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk based products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12 month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. We base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period; however, medical cost inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for UnitedHealthcares commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2006 would have been reduced by approximately $170 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. If these 58 Table of Contents estimates prove too high or too low, the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results. That change can be either positive or negative to our results. We face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate. For our Uniprise and Health Care Services segments, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente and WellPoint, Inc., numerous for profit organizations and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. Our Specialized Care Services and Ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses. The addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier or provider arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. Our relationship with AARP is important. Under a ten year contract with AARP, which commenced in 1998, we provide Medicare Supplement insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, health insurance focused on those ages 50 to 64 and other products to AARP members. As of December 31, 2006, this Supplemental Health Insurance program represented approximately $5.0 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 3.8 million AARP members. We also have a separate license agreement with AARP to brand certain of our Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The AARP contracts may be terminated by us or AARP at the end of their respective initial terms and may also be terminated early under certain circumstances, including a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangements depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. Some of the effects of changes in Medicare remain uncertain. The changes in Medicare as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are complex and wide ranging and continue to affect our businesses. We have taken advantage of new opportunities created by the MMA to partner with the federal government, including Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage Regional PPOs, Private Fee for Service Plans and Special Needs Plans for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. We have invested considerable resources in creating new Medicare product offerings for these initiatives and in analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with these new programs and other changes arising from the MMA. Legislative or regulatory changes to these programs could have a significant impact on us. Additionally, our ability to successfully participate in the Medicare Part D program depends in part on coordination of information and information systems between us, CMS and state governments. The inability to receive correct information due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us could adversely affect our business. Additionally, our participation in the Medicare Part D program is based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, pharmaceutical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare Part D program or otherwise, our results could be materially affected. Any positive or negative developments for the Medicare Part D program as a whole are likely to have a significant impact on us as a result of the size of our enrollment in our Medicare Part D program. 59 Table of Contents We are subject to funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. We participate as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid programs and receive revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state governments. Funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. An unexpected reduction in government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Our business is subject to routine government scrutiny, and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions, including integration of acquisitions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. We participate in federal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future. State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage determinations; mandated benefits and minimum medical expenditures; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; and government sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. We typically are involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These may include routine, regular and special investigations, examinations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. In addition, public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services. Relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers are important to our business. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially 60 Table of Contents dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices. In any particular market, these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider. To the extent that a capitated provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. The nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by provider groups. See Legal Matters for a more detailed description of our pending litigation matters. The Company is largely self insured with regard to litigation risks; however, we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize risks associated with catastrophic claims. Although we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters. Although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that may differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products. In connection with the PacifiCare merger, we acquired a PBM business, Prescription Solutions. We also provide pharmacy benefits management services through UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions. Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions are subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies. While we do not believe that the PBM is a fiduciary, if a court were to determine that our PBM business acts as a fiduciary under ERISA, we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies, preferred drug listings and drug management programs, contracting network practices, specialty drug distribution and other transactions. Our PBM also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our PBM subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties. We also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy. 61 Table of Contents Our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been taking steps to consolidate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care providers, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, failure to consolidate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. The value of our intangible assets may become impaired. Due largely to our recent acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $18.7 billion as of December 31, 2006, representing approximately 40% of our total assets. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. Our knowledge and information related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services. We must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality. The use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as this term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. Compliance with these proposals, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
