Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. 2007 Financial Performance Highlights UnitedHealth Group had strong results in 2007. The Company achieved growth across each of its reporting segments and generated net earnings of $4.7 billion, representing an increase of 12% over 2006. Other financial performance highlights include: Diluted net earnings per common share of $3.42, an increase of 15% over 2006. Consolidated revenues of $75.4 billion, an increase of 5% over 2006. Earnings from operations of $7.8 billion, up $865 million, or 12%, over 2006. Operating margin of 10.4%, up from 9.8% in 2006. Cash flows from operations of $5.9 billion, representing 126% of 2007 net earnings. 2007 Results Compared to 2006 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues are comprised of premium revenues from risk based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; product revenues; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care services and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. For both premium risk based and fee based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through our pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business, Prescription Solutions, revenues are derived from products sold and from administrative services. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix syndicated content products. 20 Consolidated revenues in 2007 of $75.4 billion increased by $3.9 billion, or 5%, over 2006 driven primarily by rate increases on premium based and fee based services and growth in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services. Premium Revenues. Consolidated premium revenues totaled $68.8 billion in 2007, an increase of $3.1 billion, or 5%, over 2006. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk based products. Premium revenues for Commercial Markets (UnitedHealthcare and Uniprise) in 2007 totaled $36.2 billion, an increase of $623 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products and due to premiums from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products in 2007 primarily due to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2007 totaled $26.0 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 7%, over 2006. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. AmeriChoice premium revenues increased by $732 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and rate increases at OptumHealth, which contributed a premium revenue increase of 11% over 2006. Service Revenues. Consolidated service revenues in 2007 totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $340 million, or 8%, over 2006. This was driven primarily by a 38% increase in Ingenix service revenues due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. In addition, Commercial Markets service revenues increased due to a 3% increase in the number of individuals served under commercial fee based arrangements during 2007, as well as annual rate increases. Product Revenues. Consolidated product revenues in 2007 totaled $898 million, an increase of $161 million, or 22%, over 2006. The increase was driven by pharmacy sales growth at Prescription Solutions primarily due to providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members. Investment and Other Income. Investment and other income during 2007 totaled $1.1 billion, representing an increase of $273 million, or 31%, over 2006. Interest income increased by $239 million in 2007, driven by increased levels of cash and fixed income investments, due in part to deposits held for certain government sponsored programs during 2007 and the lack of share repurchase activity in the first two and a half months of 2007. Net realized gains on sales of investments were $38 million in 2007 and $4 million in 2006. We expect a slight decline in investment income in 2008 due to the declining interest rate environment in early 2008, as well as a comparatively lower level of invested asset balances expected in 2008. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues). The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 81.2% in 2006 to 80.6% in 2007. This was primarily due to a decrease in the medical care ratio relating to Ovations which was partially offset by an increase in the commercial medical care ratio resulting from the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment, as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007. 21 For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information and other facts and circumstances, that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2007 included approximately $420 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2006 included approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2007 increased $2.1 billion, or 4%, to $55.4 billion, primarily due to an annual medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk based business due to medical cost inflation and increased utilization, as well as growth in Ovations Medicare programs, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2007 of 14.0% was consistent with 2006. The operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, offset by the effect of business mix change as fee based businesses such as Ingenix increase in size and impact, as well as increased investment in technology, service and product enhancements; incremental marketing and advertising costs for Medicare Advantage products; and expenses in the first quarter of 2007 associated with the application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to our historical stock option practices, as described below. Operating costs in 2007 totaled $10.6 billion, an increase of $602 million, or 6%, over 2006. This increase was primarily due to general operating cost inflation and was also impacted by the items discussed above. Included in the operating costs for 2007 is $176 million ($112 million net of tax benefit) of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A to our historical stock option practices. As part of our review of the Companys historical stock option practices, we determined that certain stock options granted to individuals who were nonexecutive officer employees at the time of grant were granted with an exercise price that was lower than the closing price of our common stock on the applicable accounting measurement date, subjecting these individuals to additional tax under Section 409A. The Company elected to pay these individuals for the additional tax costs relating to such stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007. For any outstanding stock options subject to additional tax under Section 409A that were granted to nonexecutive officer employees, the Company increased the exercise price and committed to make cash payments to these optionholders for their vested options based on the difference between the original stock option exercise price and the revised increased stock option exercise price. The payments will be made on a quarterly basis upon vesting of the applicable awards. The first payment of $110 million was made to optionholders in January 2008 for options vested through December 31, 2007. Aggregate future payments will be $38 million, assuming all applicable options vest during 2008 and 2009. If the modified stock options are subsequently exercised, the Company will recover these cash payments at that time from exercise proceeds at the revised increased stock option exercise prices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expense ($55 million net of tax benefit) for the payment of certain optionholders tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expense ($57 million net of tax benefit) for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. These amounts have been recorded as corporate expenses and have not been allocated to individual business segments. As previously disclosed, in December 2006, the Company entered into agreements with individuals who were executive officers of the Company at the time of grant of an applicable stock option to increase the exercise price of certain outstanding stock options. No compensation was payable to any of those individuals as a result of the increase in the exercise price of their stock options. 22 Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2007 totaled $768 million, an increase of $169 million, or 28%, over 2006. This was primarily due to costs associated with increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions as a result of providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members in 2007. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2007 was $796 million, an increase of $126 million, or 19%, over 2006. This increase was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006, as well as separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2006. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in both 2007 and 2006. Business Segments During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed the transition to our new segment reporting structure which reflects how our chief operating decision maker now manages our business. Our new reporting structure has four reporting segments: Health Care Services, which now includes our Commercial Markets (UnitedHealthcare and Uniprise), Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses; OptumHealth; Ingenix; and Prescription Solutions (formerly included in the Ovations business). Historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was revised to reflect our new segment operating and financial reporting structure. The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments for the years ended December 31: (in millions) 2007 2006 PercentChange Revenues Health Care Services $ 71,199 $ 67,817 5% OptumHealth 4,921 4,342 13% Ingenix 1,304 956 36% Prescription Solutions 13,249 4,084 224% Eliminations (15,242 ) (5,657 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 75,431 $ 71,542 5% Earnings from Operations Health Care Services $ 6,595 $ 5,860 13% OptumHealth 895 809 11% Ingenix 266 176 51% Prescription Solutions 269 139 94% Corporate (176 ) nm Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 7,849 $ 6,984 12% nm not meaningful 23 Health Care Services The Health Care Services segment is composed of the Commercial Markets, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. Commercial Markets is comprised of UnitedHealthcare, which offers a comprehensive array of consumer oriented health benefit plans and services for local, small and mid sized employers and individuals nationwide, and Uniprise, which provides these services on a dedicated basis to large, multi site employers. Ovations provides health and well being services to individuals age 50 and older and AmeriChoice provides network based health and well being services to state Medicaid programs and the beneficiaries of those programs. The financial results of Commercial Markets, Ovations and AmeriChoice have been aggregated in the Health Care Services segment due to the similar economic characteristics, products and services, types of customers, distribution methods and operational processes, and regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including our contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. Health Care Services had revenues of $71.2 billion in 2007, representing an increase of $3.4 billion, or 5%, over 2006. Commercial Markets revenues of $40.3 billion in 2007 increased by $821 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was driven mainly by average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products, an increase in the number of individuals served by commercial fee based products and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products in 2007 primarily due to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee based products. Ovations revenues of $26.5 billion in 2007 increased by approximately $1.8 billion, or 7%, over 2006. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. The remaining Health Care Services revenue increase resulted from an increase in AmeriChoice revenues of $750 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2007 were $6.6 billion, representing an increase of $735 million, or 13%, over 2006. This increase was principally driven by a decrease in the medical care ratio for Ovations primarily due to favorable medical cost trends and an increase in the number of individuals served by certain Medicare products and related rate increases discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in individuals served by commercial risk based products and an increase in the related medical care ratio. The Commercial Markets medical care ratio increased to 82.6% in 2007 from 80.5% in 2006 and the UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 82.1% in 2007 from 79.8% in 2006. These increases were mainly due to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007, which was partially driven by costs from higher benefit utilization in December 2006 primarily relating to high deductible risk based products. The Health Care Services operating margin for 2007 was 9.3%, an increase from 8.6% in 2006, which reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and disciplined operating cost management as well as the factors discussed above. 24 The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31: (in thousands) 2007 2006 Commercial Risk based 10,805 11,285 Commercial Fee based 14,720 14,415 Total Commercial 25,525 25,700 Medicare Advantage 1,370 1,445 Medicaid 1,710 1,465 Standardized Medicare Supplement 2,400 2,275 Total Public and Senior 5,480 5,185 Total Health Care Services Medical Benefits 31,005 30,885 The number of individuals served with commercial products as of December 31, 2007 decreased by 175,000, or 1%, from the prior year. The number of individuals served with commercial fee based products as of December 31, 2007 increased by 305,000, or 2%, over 2006 driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk based products to fee based products, partially offset by employment attrition at continuing customers. The number of individuals served with commercial risk based products decreased by 480,000, or 4%, primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and the conversion of individuals to fee based products. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2007 decreased by 75,000, or 5%, from 2006, primarily due to a decline in participation in private fee for service offerings, while individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement products increased by 125,000, or 5%, due to new customer relationships. Medicaid enrollment increased 245,000, or 17%, in 2007 primarily due to new customer gains, including 180,000 individuals served under the TennCare program in Tennessee. OptumHealth OptumHealth provides health, well being and financial services to people and organizations nationwide through personalized health advocacy and engagement, specialized benefits such as behavioral, dental and vision offerings, and health based financial services. OptumHealth revenues of $4.9 billion increased by $579 million, or 13%, over 2006. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. OptumHealth earnings from operations in 2007 of $895 million increased $86 million, or 11%, over 2006 primarily due to the membership growth and rate increases discussed above. The OptumHealth operating margin declined from 18.6% in 2006 to 18.2% in 2007 due to a continued business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by effective operating cost management. Ingenix Ingenix offers solutions to a spectrum of health care market participants on a national and international basis, including data management services, software products, publications, consulting and actuarial services, business process outsourcing services, clinical research outsourcing, pharmaceutical data and consulting services, and revenue cycle management solutions. Ingenix revenues for 2007 of $1.3 billion increased by $348 million, or 36%, over 2006. This was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. Ingenix earnings from operations in 2007 were $266 million, up $90 million, or 51%, from 2006. This increase in earnings from operations was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 and effective operating cost management. The operating margin 25 was 20.4% in 2007, up from 18.4% in 2006. This increase in operating margin was largely driven by business growth and operating cost management described above. Prescription Solutions Prescription Solutions offers a comprehensive array of PBM and specialty pharmacy management services to employer groups, union trusts, seniors through Medicare prescription drug plans, and commercial health plans. Prescription Solutions revenues for 2007 of $13.2 billion increased by $9.2 billion, or 224%, over 2006. This was primarily driven by providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and stand alone Part D members. Intersegment revenues were eliminated in consolidation and amounted to $12.4 billion and $3.4 billion for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations in 2007 of $269 million increased $130 million, or 94%, from 2006 due largely to the expansion of services to Medicare Part D members discussed above. The operating margin was 2.0% in 2007, a decrease from 3.4% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin reflected the comparatively lower margin earned in the high volume Ovations Medicare Part D prescription drug service contract. 2006 Results Compared to 2005 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues in 2006 of $71.5 billion increased by $25.1 billion, or 54%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 21% in 2006 principally driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program on January 1, 2006, rate increases on premium based and fee based services and growth in individuals served across our business segments. Following is a discussion of our 2006 consolidated revenue for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues. Consolidated premium revenues totaled $65.7 billion in 2006, an increase of $23.6 billion, or 56%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, consolidated premium revenues increased by $8.8 billion, or 21%, over 2005. The increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk based products. Commercial Markets premium revenues in 2006 totaled $35.6 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion, or 27%, over 2005. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Commercial Markets premium revenues were essentially flat compared to 2005. This was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products, offset by lower premium yields from new business primarily due to a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high deductible lower premium products (with correspondingly lower medical costs), and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products primarily due to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2006 totaled $24.4 billion, an increase of $15.2 billion, or 165%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately $8.3 billion, or 92%, over 2005. The increase was primarily driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. OptumHealth premium revenues increased by approximately $1.0 billion over 2005. This was primarily due to the acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc. (PacifiCare) and strong growth in the number of individuals served by several OptumHealth businesses under premium based arrangements. The remaining premium revenue increase primarily resulted from membership growth and premium revenue rate increases in AmeriChoices Medicaid programs, which contributed premium revenue increases of approximately $278 million, or 8%, over 2005. 26 Service Revenues. Service revenues in 2006 totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of $602 million, or 16%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, service revenues increased by approximately 12% over 2005. The increase in service revenues was primarily driven by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals served by commercial fee based arrangements during 2006, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by approximately 22% due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Product Revenues. Product revenues in 2006 totaled $737 million, an increase of $579 million over 2005. This was primarily due to increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Investment and Other Income. Investment and other income during 2006 totaled $871 million, representing an increase of $366 million over 2005. Interest income increased by $372 million in 2006, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed income investments during the year, due in part to the acquisition of PacifiCare, as well as higher yields on fixed income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $4 million in 2006 and $10 million in 2005. Medical Costs The consolidated medical care ratio increased from 80.0% in 2005 to 81.2% in 2006. This medical care ratio increase resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of PacifiCare and launch of the Medicare Part D program, both of which carry a higher medical care ratio than the historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. Medical costs for 2006 include approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2006 increased $19.6 billion, or 58%, to $53.3 billion, due to the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program and a medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk based business. Medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program for 2006 were $4.9 billion. The medical cost trend was due to both medical inflation and increases in health care consumption. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2006 of 14.0%, improved from 15.4% in 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program and the PacifiCare acquisition. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee based revenues. The decrease in the operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration, and an insurance recovery of $43 million. These items were partially offset by a $22 million charitable contribution to the United Health Foundation and approximately $44 million of additional cash expenses related to the stock option review, exclusive of share based compensation expense. Operating costs in 2006 totaled $10.0 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 40%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, operating costs increased by approximately 13% over 2005. The increase was primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program as well as a 4% increase in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services during 2006 (excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005), growth in OptumHealth and Ingenix, general operating cost inflation, and the specific items discussed above, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment, cost savings associated with acquisition integrations and other cost management initiatives. 27 Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2006 totaled $599 million, an increase of $510 million over 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2006 was $670 million, an increase of $217 million, or 48%, over 2005. Approximately $85 million of this increase was related to intangible assets from PacifiCare and other businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. The remaining increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in 2006 and in 2005. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31: (in millions) 2006 2005 PercentChange Revenues Health Care Services $ 67,817 $ 44,119 54% OptumHealth 4,342 3,127 39% Ingenix 956 796 20% Prescription Solutions 4,084 78 nm Eliminations (5,657 ) (1,695 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 71,542 $ 46,425 54% Earnings from Operations Health Care Services $ 5,860 $ 4,376 34% OptumHealth 809 574 41% Ingenix 176 130 35% Prescription Solutions 139 nm Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 6,984 $ 5,080 37% nm not meaningful Health Care Services Health Care Services had revenues of $67.8 billion in 2006, representing an increase of $23.7 billion, or 54%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $8.6 billion, or 20%, over 2005. Commercial Markets revenues of $39.5 billion in 2006 increased by $8.1 billion, or 26%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Commercial Markets revenues increased by approximately 2% over 2005. This was primarily due to an 8% increase in the number of individuals served with commercial fee based products and annual service fee rate increases for self insured customers, as well as average premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcares renewing risk based products, partially offset by lower premium yields from a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high deductible lower premium 28 products and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products in 2006 primarily due to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee based products. Ovations revenues of $24.6 billion in 2006 increased by approximately $15.2 billion, or 162%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, Ovations revenues increased by $7.8 billion, or 85%, over 2005. The increase was primarily driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to a 8% increase in AmeriChoice revenues, excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, primarily driven by membership growth and premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2006 were $5.9 billion, representing an increase of $1.5 billion, or 34%, over 2005. This increase was principally driven by acquisitions and increases in the number of individuals served by Ovations Medicare and Part D products and Commercial Markets fee based products. The segment also benefited by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration. These initiatives also reduced labor and occupancy costs in the transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. The Commercial Markets medical care ratio increased to 80.5% in 2006 from 79.6% in 2005 and the UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 79.8% in 2006 from 78.6% in 2005, mainly due to the impact of the PacifiCare acquisition and changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services operating margin for 2006 was 8.6%, a decrease from 9.9% in 2005. This decrease was driven mainly by the acquisition of PacifiCare and the new Medicare Part D program, which have lower operating margins than historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31: (in thousands) 2006 2005 Commercial Risk based 11,285 11,350 Commercial Fee based 14,415 13,240 Total Commercial 25,700 24,590 Medicare Advantage 1,445 1,185 Medicaid 1,465 1,290 Standardized Medicare Supplement 2,275 2,150 Total Public and Senior 5,185 4,625 Total Health Care Services Medical Benefits 30,885 29,215 The number of individuals served by commercial products as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately 1.1 million, or 5%, over the prior year. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, commercial business individuals served increased by 565,000, or 3%, over the prior year. This included an increase of approximately 1.0 million in the number of individuals served with commercial fee based products, driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk based products to fee based products, offset by a decrease of approximately 475,000 in the number of individuals served with commercial risk based products primarily due to the Companys internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee based products. Excluding businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products increased by 230,000 from 2005 primarily due to new customer relationships, while individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement products increased by 125,000, or 6%, due to new 29 customer gains. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Medicaid enrollment increased 65,000, or 5%, primarily due to new customer gains. OptumHealth OptumHealth revenues of $4.3 billion increased by $1.2 billion, or 39%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, revenues increased by 20% over the prior period. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. Earnings from operations in 2006 of $809 million increased $235 million, or 41%, over 2005. OptumHealth operating margin was 18.6% in 2006, up from 18.4% in 2005. Realized improvements in operating cost structure and benefits from the integration of PacifiCare specialty operations in 2006 were partially offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products. Ingenix Ingenix revenues for 2006 of $956 million increased by $160 million, or 20%, over 2005. This was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses, as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Earnings from operations in 2006 were $176 million, up $46 million, or 35%, from 2005. Operating margin was 18.4% in 2006, up from 16.3% in 2005. These increases in earnings from operations and operating margin were primarily due to growth in the health information and pharmaceutical services businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management, and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Prescription Solutions Results for Prescription Solutions in 2006 included revenues of $4.1 billion, earnings from operations of $139 million and operating margin of 3.4%. The 2005 results included $78 million of revenue and no earnings from operations. The increases in 2006 were primarily due to the timing of the acquisition of this business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources Liquidity and Financial Condition We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short term obligations in longer term, investment grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. Factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our Board of Directors approved investment policy, regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. Our long term investments are also available for sale to meet short term liquidity and other needs. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long term debt and the 30 availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from premiums, fee income and investment income. Any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with estimated future health care costs. In 2007, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $190 million. Change in Capital Structure. On October 31, 2007, we announced that we may increase the debt component of our capital structure to the 40 percent range of debt to total capital. Effective with our debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2007 and share repurchases through year end, the debt component of our capital structure increased to 35.4%. Refer to Financing Activities below for further detail of the debt issuances, including the February 2008 issuance. These events increased our debt to total capital ratio and will reduce our weighted average total cost of capital. This change will also increase our interest expense during 2008, and thereafter as applicable. As a result of this announcement on October 31, 2007, Standard & Poors (S&P) downgraded our senior debt rating one notch from A to A and our commercial paper rating one notch from A1 to A2. S&P maintained our outlook at stable for both our senior debt and commercial paper. On January 9, 2008, Moodys downgraded our senior debt rating to Baa1 and returned our outlook to stable. Moodys affirmed our commercial paper rating at P 2 with a stable outlook. On January 30, 2008, Fitch downgraded our senior debt rating to A with a stable outlook and maintained our commercial paper rating at F 1 with a stable outlook. The interest rates on our debt and commercial paper did not change as a result of the change in debt ratings. We believe the prudent use of debt optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity. Operating Activities Net cash flows from operating activities totaled $5.9 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.1 billion for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash from operating activities in 2007 decreased from 2006 by $649 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in working capital cash flows of $1.5 billion partially offset by an increase of $495 million in net income. The decrease in working capital cash flows was driven by lower medical costs payable growth primarily related to Ovations Medicare programs as the 2006 operating cash flows benefited from the initial establishment of the medical costs payable balance related to the Medicare Part D program, fewer income tax refunds received in 2007 as well as larger income tax payments and the timing of certain government payments and receipts. Overall, our receivables and related days sales outstanding increased primarily as a result of these governmental timing differences, while our commercial business receivables remained relatively flat. Investing Activities Net cash flows used for investing activities totaled $4.1 billion, $2.1 billion and $3.5 billion for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For detail on acquisitions, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing Activities Net cash flows used for financing activities totaled $3.2 billion for 2007. Net cash flows from financing activities totaled $474 million and $836 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. 31 Debt Transactions. In February 2008, we issued a total of $3.0 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $250 million of floating rate notes due February 2011, $550 million of 4.9% fixed rate notes due February 2013, $1.1 billion of 6.0% fixed rate notes due February 2018 and $1.1 billion of 6.9% fixed rate notes due February 2038. The floating rate notes are benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and had an initial interest rate of 4.5%. On the same date, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to receive fixed rates and pay variable rates that are benchmarked to the LIBOR on the February 2013 and February 2018 notes with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $1.7 billion. In November 2007, we issued $500 million of zero coupon notes due November 2022. These zero coupon notes are original issue discount notes with an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of approximately $1.1 billion and an accretion yield of 5.3%. These notes have a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes at the accreted value at certain annual dates in the future, beginning on November 15, 2010. In November 2007, we issued a total of $1.6 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $250 million of 5.1% fixed rate notes due November 2010, $450 million of 5.5% fixed rate notes due November 2012, $250 million of 6.0% fixed rate notes due November 2017 and $650 million of 6.6% fixed rate notes due November 2037. These notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act). In January 2008, we commenced an offer to allow purchasers of the notes to exchange each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the 1933 Act. We expect to complete the exchange in February 2008. In June 2007, we issued a total of $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $500 million of floating rate notes due June 2010, $500 million of 6.0% fixed rate notes due June 2017 and $500 million of 6.5% fixed rate notes due June 2037. The floating rate notes due June 2010 are benchmarked to the LIBOR and had an interest rate of 5.1% at December 31, 2007. These notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. In January 2008, we commenced an offer to allow purchasers of the notes to exchange each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the 1933 Act. We expect to complete the exchange in February 2008. In March 2006, we issued a total of $3.0 billion in senior unsecured debt to refinance outstanding commercial paper. We issued $650 million of floating rate notes due March 2009, $750 million of 5.3% fixed rate notes due March 2011, $750 million of 5.4% fixed rate notes due March 2016 and $850 million of 5.8% fixed rate notes due March 2036. The floating rate notes due March 2009 are benchmarked to the LIBOR and had an interest rate of 5.2% and 5.5% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. PacifiCare had approximately $100 million par value of 3% convertible subordinated debentures (convertible notes) which were convertible into approximately 5.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Groups common stock and $102 million of cash as of December 31, 2005. In December 2005, we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture governing the convertible notes. The compensation consisted of the present value of interest through October 18, 2007, the earliest mandatory redemption date, plus a pro rata share of $1 million. On January 31, 2006, approximately $91 million of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer, for which we issued 4.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock, valued at $282 million, and cash of $93 million and amended the indenture governing these notes. During 2007, approximately $9 million of convertible notes were tendered for conversion, for which we issued 470,119 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock, valued at approximately $24 million, and cash of approximately $10 million. In September 2007, we notified the remaining holders of our intent to fully redeem all outstanding convertible notes on October 18, 2007, the earliest redemption date. As of October 16, 2007, all convertible notes were tendered pursuant to this redemption notice. Hedging Activities. To more closely align interest costs with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalent and investment balances, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from fixed rates to variable rates. The interest rate swap agreements have aggregate 32 notional amounts of $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2007, with variable rates that are benchmarked to the LIBOR. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate asset, recorded at fair value, for all existing interest rate swaps was approximately $151 million. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges and are accounted for using the short cut method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133), whereby the hedges are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and the carrying value of the long term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Since these amounts completely offset, we have reported both the swap asset and the debt liability within debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and there have been no net gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2007, the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 4.1% to 6.1%. Stock Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During 2007, we repurchased 125.3 million shares which were settled for cash on or before December 31, 2007 at an average price of approximately $53 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $6.6 billion. During 2006, we repurchased 40.2 million shares which were settled for cash on or before December 31, 2006 at an average price of approximately $56 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we had Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 171.9 million shares of our common stock. Our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock in 2008. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately $11.0 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively. Our debt to total capital ratio was 35.4% and 26.4% as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discounted basis with maturities up to 270 days. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk. However, a significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. See Cautionary Statements for additional information. Cash and Investments. We maintained a strong liquidity position, with cash and investments of $22.3 billion and $20.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total cash and investments increased by $1.7 billion since December 31, 2006, primarily due to strong operating cash flows, the issuance of debt, and proceeds received from common stock issuances related to exercises of share based awards, partially offset by common stock repurchases, repayments of debt, capital expenditures, and funds paid to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Medicare Part D program. As further described under Dividend Restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. At December 31, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion of our $22.3 billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and common stock repurchases. Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S 3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unlimited amount of debt securities. 33 Ratings. Currently, our senior debt is rated A with a stable outlook by S&P, A with a stable outlook by Fitch, and Baa1 with a stable outlook by Moodys. Our commercial paper is rated A2 with a stable outlook by S&P, F 1 with a stable outlook by Fitch, and P 2 with a stable outlook by Moodys. Debt Covenants. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders equity) below 50%. We were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of December 31, 2007. On August 28, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities. This followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. Bank Credit Facilities. In November 2007, we entered into a $1.5 billion 364 day revolving credit facility in order to expand our access to liquidity. The credit facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2007, we had no amounts outstanding under this bank credit facility. In May 2007, we amended and restated our $1.3 billion five year revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program. We increased the credit facility to $2.6 billion and extended the maturity date to May 2012. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility. In October 2006, we entered into a $7.5 billion 364 day revolving credit facility. Effective August 3, 2007, we elected to reduce the amount of this facility to $1.5 billion. This credit facility expired on October 15, 2007. Dividend Restrictions. We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to standards established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. In 2007 and 2006, based on the previous years statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amounts of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval were $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys regulated subsidiaries paid approximately $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion in dividends to their parent companies, including approximately $400 million and $300 million of special dividends approved by state insurance regulators, respectively. 34 Contractual Obligations, Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commitments The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2007, under our various contractual obligations, off balance sheet arrangements and commitments: (in millions) 2008 2009 to 2010 2011 to 2012 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper (1) $ 1,946 $ 2,103 $ 1,197 $ 5,763 $ 11,009 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper (2) 484 804 655 4,147 6,090 Operating Leases 173 317 204 345 1,039 Purchase Obligations (3) 204 161 17 382 Future Policy Benefits (4) 167 335 327 1,187 2,016 Unrecognized Tax Benefits (5) 4 210 214 Unfunded Investment Commitments (6) 131 221 6 3 361 Other Long Term Obligations (7) 7 31 408 446 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,116 $ 3,972 $ 2,406 $ 12,063 $ 21,557 (1) Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of acceleration is remote. (2) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2007 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. Includes unamortized discounts from par values. (3) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007. (4) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Unrecognized tax benefits relate to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48). Since the timing of future settlements are uncertain, the long term portion has been classified as Thereafter. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (6) Includes remaining capital commitments for equity investment funds and the investment commitment related to the PacifiCare acquisition discussed below. (7) Includes future payments to optionholders related to the application of Section 409A, as well as obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition discussed below, which have been classified as Thereafter due to uncertainty regarding payment timing. The table above includes a facility lease agreement that we signed in 2006. Lease payments are expected to commence under this agreement in March 2009, at the time we occupy the facility, and extend over a 20 year period with total estimated lease payments of $229 million. In conjunction with the PacifiCare acquisition we committed to make $50 million in charitable contributions for the benefit of California health care consumers, which has been accrued in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have committed to specific projects totaling approximately $18 million of the $50 million charitable commitment at December 31, 2007, of which $6 million was paid. Additionally, we agreed to invest $200 million in 35 Californias health care infrastructure to further health care services to the underserved populations of the California marketplace, of which $8 million was invested at December 31, 2007. The timing and amount of individual contributions and investments are at our discretion subject to the advice and oversight of the local regulatory authorities; however, our goal is to have the investment commitment fully funded by the end of 2010. The investment commitment remains in place for 20 years after funding. The unfunded charitable commitment and investment commitment have been included in the above table. At December 31, 2007, we had pending cash acquisitions. See Note 4 of Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. We do not have any other material contractual obligations, off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract Beginning January 1, 2006, the Company began serving as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. The Company contracts with CMS on an annual basis. Under Medicare Part D, members have access to a standard drug benefit that features a monthly premium, typically with an initial annual deductible, coinsurance of 25% for the member and 75% for the Company up to an initial coverage limit of $2,400 of annual drug costs, no insurance coverage between $2,400 and $5,451 (except the member gets the benefit of the Companys significant drug discounts), and catastrophic coverage for annual drug costs in excess of $5,451 covered approximately 80% by CMS, 15% by the Company and 5% by the member up to an annual out of pocket maximum of $3,850. The Companys contract with CMS includes risk sharing provisions, wherein CMS retains approximately 75% to 80% of the losses or profits outside a pre defined risk corridor. The risk sharing provisions take effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than 2.5% above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the Company in its initial contract application. Contracts are generally non cancelable by enrollees; however, enrollees may change plans during an annual enrollment period each year. As a result of the Medicare Part D product benefit design, the Company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs early in the contract year. While the Company is responsible for approximately 67% of a Medicare Part D beneficiarys drug costs up to $2,400, the beneficiary is responsible for 100% of their drug costs from $2,400 up to $5,451 (at the Companys discounted purchase price). Consequently, the Company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs in the first half of the contract year as compared with the last half of the contract year, when comparatively more members will be incurring claims above the $2,400 initial coverage limit. The uneven timing of Medicare Part D pharmacy benefit claims results in losses in the first half of the year that entitle the Company to risk share adjustment payments from CMS. Accordingly, during the interim periods within the contract year we record a net risk share receivable from CMS in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This represents the estimated amount payable by CMS to the Company under the risk share contract provisions if the program were terminated based on estimated costs incurred through that interim period. Those losses are typically expected to reverse in the second half of the year. Total premium revenues from CMS related to the Medicare Part D program and all other Medicare related programs were approximately 25% of our total consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. As of January 1, 2008, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D coverage by CMS, including: The initial coverage limit increased to $2,510. The catastrophic coverage begins at $5,726. 36 The annual out of pocket maximum increased to $4,050. The risk share provisions take effect if actual costs are more than 5% above or below expected costs. CMS retains 50% to 80% of the losses or profits outside this risk corridor. These changes result in an increase in the amount of losses or profits that we may realize from this contract in 2008 as the amount of risk retained by CMS has diminished. AARP We provide health insurance products and services to members of AARP. These products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional Medicare (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, health insurance focused on persons between 50 to 64 years of age, and other products (Supplemental Health Insurance Program). Under the Supplemental Health Insurance Program, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. We are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings. Premium revenues from our portion of the AARP Supplemental Health Insurance Program were approximately $5.3 billion in 2007, $5.0 billion in 2006 and $4.9 billion in 2005. The underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF). The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we would have to fund the deficit. Any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. As further described in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks and liabilities associated with the contract. Under separate trademark license agreements with AARP, we sell AARP branded Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plans and Medicare Advantage plans. We pay AARP a license fee for the use of the trademark and member data and assume all operational and underwriting risks. On October 3, 2007, we entered into new agreements with AARP which amended our existing arrangements. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but 37 not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36 month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us as of the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. We do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors. Accordingly, for the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control, as well as through a review of near term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2007: Completion Factor Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (1) (in millions) (0.75)% $ 135 (0.50)% $ 90 (0.25)% $ 45 0.25% $ (45 ) 0.50% $ (90 ) 0.75% $ (135 ) 38 Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical costs payable for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2007: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (2) (in millions) 3% $ 258 2% $ 172 1% $ 86 (1)% $ (86 ) (2)% $ (172 ) (3)% $ (258 ) (1) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical cost payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. (2) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in medical costs PMPM trend data used in developing medical cost payable estimates for the most recent three months. The analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience in estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations: FavorableDevelopment Increase (Decrease)to Medical Costs (a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations (in millions) As Reported As Adjusted (b) As Reported As Adjusted (b) 2005 $ 400 $ (30 ) $ 33,669 $ 33,639 $ 5,080 $ 5,110 2006 $ 430 $ 10 $ 53,308 $ 53,318 $ 6,984 $ 6,974 2007 $ 420 (c ) $ 55,435 (c ) $ 7,849 (c ) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year. (b) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (c) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2008 will change as our December 31, 2007 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2008. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2007, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2007; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2007 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding the AARP business, 2007 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $72 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.03 per share. 39 Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2007, we had long lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and property, equipment and capitalized software, of $20.7 billion. We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. Investments As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $13.4 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2007, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $182 million and gross unrealized losses of $27 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investments fair value is other than temporary. We analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular 40 quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. See Cautionary Statements for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation. Legal Matters A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. Concentrations of Credit Risk Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2007, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2007, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. Cautionary Statements The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believes, anticipates, expects, plans, seeks, intends, will likely result, estimates, projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward looking statements about future results. Any or all forward looking statements in this Form 10 K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. 41 Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historical Stock Option Practices Matters relating to or arising out of our historical stock option practices, including regulatory inquiries, litigation matters, and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In early 2006, our Board of Directors initiated an independent review of the Companys historical stock option practices from 1994 to 2005. The independent review was conducted by an independent committee comprised of three independent directors of the Company (Independent Committee) with the assistance of independent counsel and independent accounting advisors. On October 15, 2006, we announced that the Independent Committee had completed their review of the Companys historical stock option practices and reported the findings to the non management directors of the Company. As a result of our historical stock option practices, we restated our previously filed financial statements, we are subject to various regulatory inquiries and litigation matters, and we may be subject to further cash and noncash charges, the outcome of any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Regulatory Inquiries As previously disclosed, the SEC and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York are conducting investigations into the Companys historical stock option practices and the Company has received requests for documents from the Minnesota Attorney General and various Congressional committees in connection with these issues and the Companys executive compensation practices. We have not resolved these matters. We cannot provide assurance that the Company will not be subject to adverse publicity, regulatory or criminal fines, penalties, or other sanctions or contingent liabilities or adverse customer reactions in connection with these matters. In addition, we may be subject to additional regulatory inquiries arising out of the review of the Independent Committee, the review of a special litigation committee, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, appointed by our Board of Directors to review claims asserted in federal and state shareholder derivative claims relating to our historical stock option practices (Special Litigation Committee), and the related restatement of our historical financial statements. Regulatory inquiries may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any regulatory inquiry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation Matters We and certain of our current and former directors and officers are defendants in a consolidated federal securities class action, an Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) class action, and state and federal shareholder derivative actions relating to our historical stock option practices. We also have received shareholder demands relating to those practices. In addition, following our announcement that we would delay filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities. We cannot provide assurance that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings and shareholder demands. In addition, we may be subject to additional litigation, proceedings or actions arising out of the Independent Committees review, the Special Litigation Committees review and the related restatement of our historical financial statements. Litigation regulatory proceedings or actions may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 42 Potential Additional Cash and Noncash Charges While we believe we have made appropriate judgments in our restated financial statements in determining the financial impacts of our historical stock option practices, we cannot provide assurance that the SEC will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impacts, including the adjustments that we made based on our determination of the measurement dates for our historical stock option grants. If the SEC disagrees with our financial adjustments and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements, we may have to further restate our prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, other adjustments for non operating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock option related matters arising under litigation and the above referenced regulatory reviews, the amount and timing of which are uncertain but which could be material. Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Business If we fail to effectively estimate and manage our health care costs, the profitability of our risk based products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results. Under our risk based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk based products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a 12 month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. We base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed contract period; however, medical cost inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2007 would have been reduced by approximately $190 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. If these estimates prove too low, they will have a negative impact on our future results. If we fail to comply with or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in federal and state regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. The broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering those regulations, as well as future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions, including integration of certain acquisitions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. 43 We participate in federal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future. State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage determinations; mandated benefits and minimum medical expenditures; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; consumer driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms; confidentiality of health information; and government sponsored programs. For example, from time to time, Congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. Additionally, there have been legislative attempts to limit ERISAs preemptive effect on state laws. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations. We cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, the health care industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by: adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services; requiring us to change our products and services; or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. In August 2007, we entered into a multi state national agreement with regulatory offices in 38 states relating to the legacy UnitedHealthcare fully insured commercial business. The agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations, including claims payment accuracy and timeliness, appeals and grievances resolution timeliness, health care professional network/service, utilization review, explanation of benefits accuracy, and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance. The agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to August 2007 and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through December 2010. On a prospective basis, the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee, whereby we will self report quarterly and annually our operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states. We must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement, or be subject to fines and penalties. We are also involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These regulatory activities include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC and other governmental authorities. Reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. For example, in 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care and the California Department of Insurance examined our PacifiCare health plans in California. As a result of these examinations, the California Department of Managed Health Care has assessed a penalty of $3.5 million related to its findings. The California Department of Insurance, however, has not yet levied a financial penalty related to its findings. In addition, public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services. 44 Our business providing PBM services are subject to federal and state regulations associated with the PBM industry and if we fail to comply with these regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In connection with the PacifiCare merger, we acquired a PBM business, Prescription Solutions. We also provide PBM services through UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions. Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions are subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies. In the event a court were to determine that our PBM business acts as a fiduciary under ERISA, we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies, preferred drug listings and drug management programs, contracting network practices, specialty drug distribution and other transactions. Our PBM business also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our PBM subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties. We also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. For our Health Care Services segment, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as Medicare specialty services. For our Prescription Solutions business, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS/Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and Ingenix business segments also compete with a number of other businesses. The addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier or health care professional arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals) in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. If we do not complete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership does not increase as we expect, if membership declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A reduction or less than expected increase in Medicare and Medicaid program funding and or our failure to retain and acquire Medicare, Medicaid and State Medicaid Childrens Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP) enrollees could adversely affect our revenues and financial results. We participate as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and various Medicaid and SCHIP programs and receive revenues from the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP programs to provide benefits under these programs. Our participation in these programs is through bids that are submitted periodically. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these programs is dependent upon 45 many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. A reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Our ability to retain and acquire Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by us and our competitors. Under the Medicaid Managed Care program, state Medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid Managed Care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold, which is set by the government after our bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold, we risk losing the members who were auto assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto assigned to us. For example, we lost approximately 650,000 of our auto enrolled low income subsidy members in 2008 because our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors bids and positioning are different than anticipated, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare program or otherwise, our financial results could be materially affected. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices and services. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services. In any particular market, these physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. There can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. 46 If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. The use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm Leach Bliley Act and in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. In addition, despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and or human errors or other similar events. Compliance with any privacy proposals, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. Noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. Our relationship with AARP is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with AARP, we provide AARP branded Medicare Supplement insurance, hospital indemnity insurance and other products to AARP members and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to AARP members and non members. One of our agreements with AARP expands the relationship to include AARP branded Medicare Advantage plans for AARP members and non members. Our agreements with AARP contain commitments regarding corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers. The AARP agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances, including, depending on the agreement, a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company, material changes in the Medicare programs, material harm to AARP caused by the Company, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangements depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, meet our corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and diversity commitments, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. The loss of our AARP relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely subject to various litigation actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups. 47 We are largely self insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters, however, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been taking steps to consolidate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and changing customer patterns. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, failure to consolidate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected. Due largely to our recent acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2007, representing approximately 37% of our total assets. If we make additional acquisitions, it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. 48 Our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states Departments of Insurance. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agencys opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. Downgrades in our ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our financial results. Fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our returns on, and the market value of, fixed income and short term investments, which comprise the majority of the fair value of our investments at December 31, 2007. In addition, defaults by issuers, primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds, who fail to pay or perform on their obligations could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments, which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity. We also invest a smaller proportion of our investments in equity investments, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments. General economic conditions, stock market conditions, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses. 49 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices. The Companys primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long term debt. Approximately $13.0 billion of our investments at December 31, 2007 were debt securities. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed income investment portfolio at December 31, 2007, the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $460 million. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. To mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely align the fixed interest rates of our long term debt with the variable rates of our cash equivalents and short term investments. Including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $8.2 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and $2.8 billion had fixed rates as of December 31, 2007. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our debt by approximately $330 million. At December 31, 2007, we had $383 million of equity investments, a portion of which were held in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio. 50
