BUSINESS OVERVIEW UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well being company, serving more than 70 million Americans. Our focus is on enhancing the performance of the health system and improving the overall health and well being of the people we serve and their communities. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost, support the physician/patient relationship, and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. We provide individuals with access to quality, cost effective health care services and resources. We provide employers and consumers with excellent value, service and support, and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth, profitability and capital discipline. BUSINESS TRENDS Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 16% of gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. Management expects overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, based on inflation, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well being. The rate of growth may be impacted by a variety of factors, including macro economic conditions and proposed health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Adverse Economic Conditions The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for certain of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers and will pressure top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare business. In contrast, our AmeriChoice business has seen increased participation in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. In total, management believes that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability. Management also believes that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how a prolonged economic downturn could affect our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. Proposed Federal Economic Stimulus Package In the short term, our businesses may benefit if proposed elements of the federal economic stimulus package responding to the current recession are signed into law. These include expansion of funding to state programs, 31 Table of Contents which could mitigate funding pressure for AmeriChoice Medicaid offerings at the state level, expansion of coverage for recently unemployed workers through their former employers plans, which could enhance participation in UnitedHealthcare benefit programs, and funding for health care information technology, which could expand market opportunities for Ingenix. Proposed Health Care Reforms There is regular dialogue about health care reforms at both state and national levels, due to the size of and national interest in the health economy. Examples of these health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, such as having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system or a fundamental restructuring of the Medicare or Medicaid programs. The new administration and various congressional leaders have signaled their interest in reducing payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Depending on the extent and phasing of these potential reductions, management believes that the number of seniors participating in Medicare Advantage and the industry wide earnings derived from these plans may fall. However, if payment rates do come down, management believes that there are a number of adjustments we can make to our operations annually, which may partially offset any earnings impact. For example, we can adjust members benefits, we can decide on a county by county basis which geographies to participate in, and we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management. Any payment reductions may be phased in over a number of years. If industry wide Medicare Advantage membership reduces, there is likely to be increased demand for Medicare Supplemental insurance and Part D prescription drug coverage, and in both categories Ovations is also a market leader. We operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses; this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. Therefore, we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for various of our products and services, depending on the scope, shape and timing of health care reforms. It is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid to long term time horizon. For additional discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. 2008 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY We generated net earnings of $3.0 billion, representing a decrease of 36% compared to 2007.

On May 30, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Unison Health Plans (Unison) for approximately $930 million in cash. Unison provides government sponsored health plan coverage to people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee, Delaware, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. through a network of independent health care professionals. This acquisition strengthened our resources and capabilities in these areas. The results of operations and financial condition of Unison have been included in our consolidated results and the results of our Health Care Services reporting segment since the acquisition date. Sierra Health Services, Inc. On February 25, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sierra Health Services, Inc. (Sierra), a diversified health care services company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, for approximately $2.6 billion in cash, representing a price of $43.50 per share of Sierra common stock. This acquisition strengthened our position in the southwest region of the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice approved the acquisition conditioned upon the divestiture of our individual SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada, which represented approximately 30,000 members. The divestiture was completed on April 30, 2008. We received proceeds of $185 million for this transaction which were recorded as a reduction to Operating Costs. Group SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage plans offered through commercial 33 Table of Contents contracts were excluded from the divestiture. Also, we retained Sierras Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Nevada. The results of operations and financial condition of Sierra have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Care Services, OptumHealth and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. Fiserv Health, Inc. On January 10, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Fiserv Health, Inc. (Fiserv Health), a subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc., for approximately $740 million in cash. Fiserv Health is a leading administrator of medical benefits and also provides care facilitation services, specialty health solutions and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. This transaction allows us to expand the capacity of our existing benefits administration businesses and enables existing and new customers to leverage our full range of assets, including ancillary services, our national network and technology tools. The results of operations and financial condition of Fiserv Health have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Care Services, OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. 2008 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2007 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues consist of premium revenues from risk based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; product revenues; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependants. For both premium risk based and fee based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through our Prescription Solutions PBM business, revenues are derived from both products sold and administrative services. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. Consolidated revenues for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the Health Care Services reporting segment. The following is a discussion of consolidated revenues for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues. The premium revenue growth generated by our Health Care Services reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase. This increase was due to the growth in individuals served by our Public and Senior Markets Group, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in 2008, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Service Revenues. The increase in service revenues for 2008 was driven by an increased number of individuals served by fee based product arrangements in the Health Care Services reporting segment, primarily due to the Fiserv Health acquisition. In addition, our Ingenix reporting segment generated service revenue growth from its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions. Product Revenues. Product revenues for 2008 increased due to increased prescription volume at our Prescription Solutions reporting segment, primarily related to the Fiserv Health acquisition. 34 Table of Contents Investment and Other Income. The decrease in investment and other income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily as a result of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents, decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows, decreased deposits held for certain government sponsored programs and increased other than temporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2008 increased primarily due to medical cost inflation, acquisitions completed in 2008 and growth in Ovations Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. Our consolidated medical care ratio increase was primarily driven by premium rates advancing more slowly than medical costs in 2008 for certain risk based products in the commercial, senior and behavioral care markets. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. Medical costs for 2008 included approximately $230 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2007 included approximately $420 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, increased in 2008 primarily due to certain expenses as discussed below, acquisitions completed in 2008, costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from fee based businesses. Operating costs for 2008 include $882 million for the proposed settlements of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, net of expected insurance proceeds, and $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out of network medical services, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in expenses for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership of our individual Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada relating to the Sierra acquisition. These amounts have been recorded in the corporate segment. For a discussion of the proposed settlements, see Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating costs for 2007 include $176 million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to our historical stock option practices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. These amounts have been recorded in the corporate segment. For an expanded discussion of our Section 409A charges, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased due to increased prescription volume at our Prescription Solutions reporting segment, primarily related to the Fiserv Health acquisition. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements, as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to recent business acquisitions. Interest Expense Interest expense increased due to an increase in our debt outstanding, which was partially offset by lower market interest rates on our floating rate debt. Income Taxes The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of tax free investment income to total earnings. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: Health Care Services, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice; OptumHealth; Ingenix; and Prescription Solutions. Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Care Services customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Care Services customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to Health Care Services by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 36 Table of Contents The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments for the years ended December 31: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Revenues Health Care Services $ 75,857 $ 71,199 $ 67,817 $ 4,658 7 % $ 3,382 5 % OptumHealth 5,225 4,921 4,342 304 6 % 579 13 % Ingenix 1,552 1,304 956 248 19 % 348 36 % Prescription Solutions 12,573 13,249 4,084 (676 ) (5 )% 9,165 224 % Eliminations (14,021 ) (15,242 ) (5,657 ) 1,221 nm (9,585 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 81,186 $ 75,431 $ 71,542 $ 5,755 8 % $ 3,889 5 % Earnings from Operations Health Care Services $ 5,068 $ 6,595 $ 5,860 $ (1,527 ) (23 )% $ 735 13 % OptumHealth 718 895 809 (177 ) (20 )% 86 11 % Ingenix 229 266 176 (37 ) (14 )% 90 51 % Prescription Solutions 363 269 139 94 35 % 130 94 % Corporate (1,115 ) (176 ) (939 ) nm (176 ) nm Consolidated Earnings from Operations $ 5,263 $ 7,849 $ 6,984 $ (2,586 ) (33 )% $ 865 12 % Operating Margin Health Care Services 6.7 % 9.3 % 8.6 % (2.6 )% 0.7 % OptumHealth 13.7 % 18.2 % 18.6 % (4.5 )% (0.4 )% Ingenix 14.8 % 20.4 % 18.4 % (5.6 )% 2.0 % Prescription Solutions 2.9 % 2.0 % 3.4 % 0.9 % (1.4 )% Consolidated Operating Margin 6.5 % 10.4 % 9.8 % (3.9 )% 0.6 % nm not meaningful Health Care Services The revenue growth in Health Care Services for 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our Public and Senior Markets Group, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the 2008 acquisitions of Sierra, Fiserv Health, and Unison, partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial risk based products and Medicare Part D products and a decrease in investment income. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $41.8 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 4%. The UnitedHealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for Health Care Services in 2008. Ovations revenues of $28.1 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products gained through both organic growth and the Sierra acquisition and premium rate increases, which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of 675,000 stand alone Medicare Part D members primarily due to the reassignment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of certain dual eligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $6.0 billion in 2008, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 34%, over the comparable 2007 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans, premium rate increases and the acquisition of Unison in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in Health Care Services earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the UnitedHealthcare risk based business and pressure on gross margins in Medicare Part D 37 Table of Contents prescription drug plans, partially offset by acquisitions. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 83.5% in 2008 from 82.6% in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases, net of customer benefit package changes, did not fully match the rise in medical costs, and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business, which typically carries a higher medical care ratio. Health Care Services operating margin was 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease from 9.3% in 2007 primarily driven by the factors discussed above. The following summarizes the number of individuals served, by major market segment and funding arrangement, at December 31: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Commercial Risk based 10,360 10,805 11,285 (445 ) (4 )% (480 ) (4 )% Commercial Fee based 15,985 14,720 14,415 1,265 9 % 305 2 % Total Commercial 26,345 25,525 25,700 820 3 % (175 ) (1 )% Medicare Advantage 1,495 1,370 1,445 125 9 % (75 ) (5 )% Medicaid 2,515 1,710 1,465 805 47 % 245 17 % Standardized Medicare Supplement 2,540 2,400 2,275 140 6 % 125 5 % Total Public and Senior 6,550 5,480 5,185 1,070 20 % 295 6 % Total Health Care Services Medical Benefits 32,895 31,005 30,885 1,890 6 % 120 % The number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions, which included the addition of 1,315,000 fee based members from Fiserv Health and the addition of 310,000 risk based individuals gained through the Sierra acquisition. These additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of 805,000, or 3%, from December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial risk based products and the impact of a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products at December 31, 2008 increased through the addition of 60,000 seniors from our acquisition of Sierra and organic growth of 95,000 seniors, partially offset by the divestiture of 30,000 individuals in Nevada related to the Sierra acquisition. Medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of 320,000 and 60,000 individuals from our Unison and Sierra acquisitions, respectively, and strong organic growth of 425,000 individuals. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment. OptumHealth provided services to approximately 60 million consumers at December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 1 million individuals year over year. Earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for risk based behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business. Ingenix The improvement in Ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions. The decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during 2008 for certain research projects which were cancelled, as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment. Prescription Solutions The decreased Prescription Solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dual eligible beneficiaries described above through Medicare Part D 38 Table of Contents prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment, and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization, partially offset by revenues related to the Fiserv Health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $11.0 billion and $12.4 billion for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the Fiserv Health acquisition, gains in mail service drug fulfillment, and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. 2007 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2006 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues increased in 2007 primarily due to rate increases on premium based and fee based services and growth in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services. Premium Revenues. Consolidated premium revenues increased in 2007 primarily due to premium rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk based products. Premium revenues for UnitedHealthcare in 2007 totaled $36.2 billion, an increase of $623 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products and due to premiums from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products in 2007 primarily due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2007 totaled $26.0 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 7%, over 2006. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare Supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. AmeriChoice premium revenues increased by $732 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and rate increases at OptumHealth, which contributed a premium revenue increase of 11% over 2006. Service Revenues. The 2007 increase in consolidated service revenues was driven primarily by a 38% increase in Ingenix service revenues due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. In addition, UnitedHealthcare service revenues increased due to a 3% increase in the number of individuals served under commercial fee based arrangements during 2007, as well as annual rate increases. Product Revenues. The 2007 increase in consolidated product revenues was driven by pharmacy sales growth at Prescription Solutions primarily due to providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members. Investment and Other Income. Interest income increased by $239 million in 2007, driven by increased levels of cash and fixed income investments, due in part to deposits held for certain government sponsored programs during 2007 and the lack of share repurchase activity in the first two and one half months of 2007. Net realized gains on sales of investments were $38 million in 2007 and $4 million in 2006. Medical Costs The consolidated medical care ratio decreased primarily due to a decrease in the medical care ratio relating to Ovations which was partially offset by an increase in the commercial medical care ratio resulting from our 39 Table of Contents internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment, as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007. Medical costs for 2007 included approximately $420 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2006 included approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2007 increased primarily due to an annual medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk based business due to medical cost inflation and increased utilization, as well as growth in Ovations Medicare programs, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2007 was consistent with 2006. The operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, offset by the effect of business mix change as fee based businesses such as Ingenix increase in size and impact, as well as increased investment in technology, service and product enhancements; incremental marketing and advertising costs for Medicare Advantage products; and expenses in the first quarter of 2007 associated with the application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A to our historical stock option practices, as described in 2008 Results Compared to 2007 Results above. The increase in operating costs in 2007 was primarily due to general operating cost inflation and was also impacted by the items discussed above. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased in 2007 primarily due to costs associated with increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions as a result of providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members in 2007. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2007 was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006, as well as separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2006. Reporting Segments Health Care Services UnitedHealthcare revenues of $40.3 billion in 2007 increased by $821 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was driven mainly by average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcares renewing commercial risk based products, an increase in the number of individuals served by commercial fee based products and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products in 2007 primarily due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee based products. Ovations revenues of $26.5 billion in 2007 increased by approximately $1.8 billion, or 7%, over 2006. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. The remaining Health Care Services revenue increase 40 Table of Contents resulted from an increase in AmeriChoice revenues of $750 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. The increase in Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2007 was principally driven by a decrease in the medical care ratio for Ovations primarily due to favorable medical cost trends and an increase in the number of individuals served by certain Medicare products and related rate increases discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in individuals served by commercial risk based products and an increase in the related medical care ratio. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 82.6% in 2007 from 80.5% in 2006. This increase was mainly due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007, which was partially driven by costs from higher benefit utilization in December 2006 primarily relating to high deductible risk based products. The Health Care Services operating margin for 2007 was 9.3%, an increase from 8.6% in 2006, which reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and disciplined operating cost management as well as the factors discussed above. The increase in the number of individuals served with commercial fee based products as of December 31, 2007 was driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk based products to fee based products, partially offset by employment attrition at continuing customers. The number of individuals served with commercial risk based products decreased primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and the conversion of individuals to fee based products. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2007 decreased primarily due to a decline in participation in private fee for service offerings, while individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement products increased due to new customer relationships. Medicaid enrollment increased in 2007 primarily due to new customer gains, including 180,000 individuals served under the TennCare program in Tennessee. OptumHealth The OptumHealth revenues increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. OptumHealth earnings from operations increased in 2007 primarily due to the membership growth and rate increases. The OptumHealth operating margin declined from 18.6% in 2006 to 18.2% in 2007 due to a continued business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by effective operating cost management. Ingenix The Ingenix revenues increase in 2007 was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. The increase in earnings from operations was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 and effective operating cost management. The operating margin was 20.4% in 2007, up from 18.4% in 2006. This increase in operating margin was largely driven by business growth and operating cost management described above. Prescription Solutions The Prescription Solutions revenues increase in 2007 was primarily driven by providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and stand alone Part D members. 41 Table of Contents Intersegment revenues were eliminated in consolidation and amounted to $12.4 billion and $3.4 billion for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations increased largely due to the expansion of services to Medicare Part D members discussed above. The operating margin was 2.0% in 2007, a decrease from 3.4% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin reflected the comparatively lower margin earned in the high volume Ovations Medicare Part D prescription drug service contracts. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity and Financial Condition We manage our cash, investments and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term, investment grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. These investments are made pursuant to our Board of Directors approved investment policy, which generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances, which focuses on preservation of capital, diversification and duration. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt, as well as the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses by making capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions and repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from net earnings, prior to depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic and customer diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs. 42 Table of Contents A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below. For the Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Sources of Cash: Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 4,238 $ 5,877 $ 6,526 Maturities and Sales of Investments 8,598 3,365 4,096 Proceeds from Issuance of Long Term Debt 2,981 3,582 3,000 Other 1,770 1,962 2,395 Total Sources of Cash 17,587 14,786 16,017 Uses of Cash: Purchases of Investments (9,251 ) (6,379 ) (4,851 ) Cash Paid for Acquisitions, net of cash assumed and dispositions (3,813 ) (262 ) (670 ) Common Stock Repurchases (2,684 ) (6,599 ) (2,345 ) Other (3,278 ) (3,001 ) (3,252 ) Total Uses of Cash (19,026 ) (16,241 ) (11,118 ) Net (Decrease) Increase in Cash $ (1,439 ) $ (1,455 ) $ 4,899 Net cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.6 billion in 2008, or 28%, primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of $1.7 billion which included payments of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices. For detail on these settlements, see Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2008, our cash, cash equivalent and available for sale investment balances of $21.4 billion included $7.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $13.5 billion of debt securities and $477 million of equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our investment portfolio has a relatively short average duration and a weighted average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2008. Included in the debt securities balance is $3.3 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is AA as of December 31, 2008 for the securities for which such information is available. Commercial Paper. Commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities up to 270 days. As of December 31, 2008, we had $101 million of outstanding commercial paper with interest rates ranging from 5.1% to 7.1%. This range in rates reflects increases in the market rates for Tier 2 credit rated commercial paper. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices. During 2008, we repurchased 72 million shares at an average price of approximately $37 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.7 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 103 million shares of our common stock. 43 Table of Contents Capital Resources As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had commercial paper and long term debt outstanding of $12.8 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments. We maintained a highly liquid position, with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $21.6 billion as of December 31, 2008. As further described under Dividend Restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $865 million of our $21.6 billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases. Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S 3 shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registering an unlimited amount of debt securities. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2008 were as follows: Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 Stable A Negative A Negative Commercial Paper P 2 n/a A 2 n/a F1 n/a See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of our risks related to downgrades in our credit ratings. Debt Covenants. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio below 50%. Our debt to total capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders equity) was 38.1% and 35.4% as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. We were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of December 31, 2008. In August 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities. This followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the proceeding regarding the purported default. Bank Credit Facilities. In November 2008, we entered into a $750 million 364 day revolving bank credit facility which replaced our $1.5 billion 364 day revolving bank credit facility entered into in November 2007. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2008, the interest rate ranged from 2.9% to 4.3%. In May 2007, we amended and restated our $1.3 billion five year revolving bank credit facility which included increasing the capacity. There is currently $2.5 billion available under this credit facility which matures in May 2012. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2008, the interest rate ranged from 0.6% to 2.0%. 44 Table of Contents These credit facilities support our commercial paper program and are available for general working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. Dividend Restrictions. We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to regulations and standards established by their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures, business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, an inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt; however, our cash flows from operations of our unregulated businesses, as well as liquidity at the parent level in the form of cash and cash equivalent balances and commercial paper or bank funding, mitigate this risk. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of our risks related to dividend restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries. In 2008, based on the 2007 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was $3.0 billion. As of December 31, 2008, our regulated subsidiaries have paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators. In 2007, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was $2.5 billion. In 2007, $2.9 billion was paid to their parent companies, including $400 million of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2008, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2009 2010 to 2011 2012 to 2013 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper (a) $ 1,456 $ 1,819 $ 1,515 $ 8,004 $ 12,794 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper (b) 425 793 724 5,792 7,734 Operating Leases 258 425 303 688 1,674 Purchase Obligations (c) 149 45 1 195 Future Policy Benefits (d) 154 335 326 1,196 2,011 Unrecognized Tax Benefits (e) 2 205 207 Unfunded Investment Commitments (f) 134 82 10 10 236 Other Long Term Obligations (g) 56 2 319 377 Total Contractual Obligations $ 2,634 $ 3,501 $ 2,879 $ 16,214 $ 25,228 (a) Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of acceleration is remote. (b) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2008 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. Includes unamortized discounts from par values. (c) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes 45 Table of Contents agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2008. (d) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Unrecognized tax benefits relate to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48). Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long term portion has been classified as Thereafter. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and the investment commitment related to the PacifiCare acquisition. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (g) Includes future payments to optionholders related to the application of Section 409A, as well as obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition discussed below, which have been classified as Thereafter due to uncertainty regarding payment timing. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142 3). FSP 142 3 amends the factors to be considered in developing renewal and extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset accounted for under FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP 142 3 is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after January 1, 2009. Early adoption is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FSP 142 3 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R), which replaces FAS No. 141, Business Combinations. FAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in our financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively to all new acquisitions closing on or after January 1, 2009. Early adoption of this standard is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 141R will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The 46 Table of Contents standard is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 160 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36 month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. We do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors. Accordingly, for the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease 47 Table of Contents Control, as well as through a review of near term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2008: Completion FactorsIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs (in millions) (0.75)% $ 148 (0.50)% $ 99 (0.25)% $ 49 0.25% $ (49 ) 0.50% $ (98 ) 0.75% $ (146 ) Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2008: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs (in millions) 3% $ 281 2% $ 187 1% $ 94 (1)% $ (94 ) (2)% $ (187 ) (3)% $ (281 ) The analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations: (in millions) FavorableDevelopment Increase (Decrease)to Medical Costs (a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations As Reported As Adjusted (b) As Reported As Adjusted (b) 2006 $ 430 $ 10 $ 53,308 $ 53,318 $ 6,984 $ 6,974 2007 $ 420 $ 190 $ 55,435 $ 55,625 $ 7,849 $ 7,659 2008 $ 230 $ (c) $ 60,359 $ (c) $ 5,263 $ (c) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year. (b) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (c) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2009 will change as our December 31, 2008 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2009. 48 Table of Contents Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2008, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2008, however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2008 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2008 net earnings would increase or decrease by $48 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.04 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs, coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate are expected to have higher medical costs. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. Necessary and available diagnosis data collected and captured by us and health care providers is submitted to CMS within prescribed deadlines. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets As of December 31, 2008, we had long lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and property, equipment and capitalized software, of $24.6 billion. We review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the 49 Table of Contents future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. There were no material impairments at December 31, 2008. Investments As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $14.1 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2008, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $312 million and gross unrealized losses of $349 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investments fair value is other than temporary. We analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, asset backed, and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. If securities are downgraded below policy minimums, subsequent to purchase, they will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2008, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A. As of December 31, 2008, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $7.4 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, approximately $7.2 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2008 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts, which may materially impact our interest expense. The fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $13.7 billion of our investments were fixed rate debt securities, and approximately $5.6 billion of our debt was fixed rate term debt with no related interest rate swap contracts. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. The differential between the fixed rates received and the variable rates paid is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our swap agreements converted a majority of our interest expense from a fixed to variable rates to better offset the impact of market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. In January 2009, we terminated $4.9 billion notional of interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions to lock in the benefit of current low market interest rates. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2008 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments Fair Value ofDebt 2% $ 149 $ 133 $ (1,009 ) $ (719 ) 1% 74 66 (504 ) (392 ) (1)% (74 ) (66 ) 497 436 (2)% (149 ) (133 ) 1,012 974 (a) Including the impact of the termination of the interest rate swap contracts in January 2009, a hypothetical 1% change in market interest rates would impact the interest expense per annum by $18 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had $477 million of equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were held in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments. 51 Table of Contents
