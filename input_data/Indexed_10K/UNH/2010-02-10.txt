EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well being company, serving more than 70 million Americans. Our focus is on improving the overall health and well being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost, support the physician/patient relationship, and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. These core competencies are focused in two market areas, health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. In aggregate, these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets. Each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well being: access, affordability, quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from services performed for customers that self insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. For both risk based and fee based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from Ingenix health intelligence and contract research businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities. Our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold, or other than temporarily impaired. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. 31 Table of Contents Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business, however, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government sponsored public sector programs, will change the dynamics of our results. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. Cash Flows We generate cash primarily from premiums, service revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims, purchases of investments, common stock repurchases and payments on long term debt. For more information on our cash flows, see Liquidity below. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 17% of U.S. gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, based on inflation, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro economic conditions and proposed health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers, putting pressure on top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth businesses. This workplace attrition contributed more than half of the 7% decrease in UnitedHealthcares commercial membership during 2009, and this attrition trend is expected to continue at a generally elevated level until national employment stabilizes. In contrast, our AmeriChoice business is experiencing growth in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to recessionary conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points. Changes in federal monetary policy have reduced the level of investment income received on our portfolio on a year over year basis. In total, we believe that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability. We also believe that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. 32 Table of Contents American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Our businesses may benefit from elements of the federal economic stimulus package that was enacted in response to the current recession. These elements include expansion of funding to state programs, which could mitigate funding pressure for AmeriChoice Medicaid offerings at the state level, and funding for health care information technology, which could expand market opportunities for Ingenix. Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes. Both houses of Congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform, which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law. Examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers, imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, guaranteed coverage requirements, elimination of pre existing condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits, restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards, or restructuring the Medicare or Medicaid programs, including reducing payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. We cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be. Any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years, but, if enacted, could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our operating results, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes. The administration and various congressional leaders have advanced proposals to reduce payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Further, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010. Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by these reductions. If industry wide Medicare Advantage membership declines, there is likely to be increased demand for Medicare Supplemental insurance and Part D prescription drug coverage, and in both categories Ovations is a market leader. We operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses; this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. Therefore, we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for our various products and services, depending on the scope, shape and timing of health care reforms. It is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid to long term time horizon. For discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. 33 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following summarizes the consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31: (in millions, except percentages and pershare data) Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 REVENUES: Premiums $ 79,315 $ 73,608 $ 68,781 $ 5,707 8 % $ 4,827 7 % Services 5,306 5,152 4,608 154 3 544 12 Products 1,925 1,655 898 270 16 757 84 Investment and other income 592 771 1,144 (179 ) (23 ) (373 ) (33 ) Total revenues 87,138 81,186 75,431 5,952 7 5,755 8 OPERATING COSTS: Medical costs 65,289 60,359 55,435 4,930 8 4,924 9 Medical care ratio 82.3 % 82.0 % 80.6 % 0.3 1.4 Operating costs 12,734 13,103 10,583 (369 ) (3 ) 2,520 24 Operating cost ratio 14.6 % 16.1 % 14.0 % (1.5 ) 2.1 Cost of products sold 1,765 1,480 768 285 19 712 93 Depreciation and amortization 991 981 796 10 1 185 23 Total operating costs 80,779 75,923 67,582 4,856 6 8,341 12 EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS 6,359 5,263 7,849 1,096 21 (2,586 ) (33 ) Operating margin 7.3 % 6.5 % 10.4 % 0.8 (3.9 ) Interest expense (551 ) (639 ) (544 ) (88 ) (14 ) 95 17 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 5,808 4,624 7,305 1,184 26 (2,681 ) (37 ) Provision for income taxes (1,986 ) (1,647 ) (2,651 ) 339 21 (1,004 ) (38 ) Tax rate 34.2 % 35.6 % 36.3 % (1.4 ) (0.7 ) NET EARNINGS $ 3,822 $ 2,977 $ 4,654 $ 845 28 % $ (1,677 ) (36 ) % DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE $ 3.24 $ 2.40 $ 3.42 $ 0.84 35 % $ (1.02 ) (30 ) % RETURN ON EQUITY 17.3 % 14.9 % 22.4 % 2.4 % (7.5 ) % TOTAL PEOPLE SERVED 70 73 71 (3 ) (4 ) % 2 3 % ACQUISITIONS AIM Healthcare Services, Inc. On June 1, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of AIM Healthcare Services, Inc. (AIM) for approximately $440 million in cash. AIM is a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions for health care payer and hospital clients in all 50 states. This acquisition strengthened our capabilities to simplify and improve administration in the health care industry. The results of operations and financial condition of AIM have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Ingenix reporting segment since the acquisition date. Unison Health Plans. On May 30, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Unison Health Plans (Unison) for approximately $930 million in cash. Unison provides government sponsored health plan coverage to people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee, Delaware, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. through a network of independent health care professionals. This acquisition strengthened our resources and capabilities in these areas. The results of operations and financial condition of Unison have been included in our consolidated results and the results of our Health Benefits reporting segment since the acquisition date. 34 Table of Contents Sierra Health Services, Inc. On February 25, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sierra Health Services, Inc. (Sierra), a diversified health care services company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, for approximately $2.6 billion in cash, representing a price of $43.50 per share of Sierra common stock. This acquisition strengthened our position in the southwest region of the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice approved the acquisition conditioned upon the divestiture of our individual Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada, which represented approximately 30,000 members. The divestiture was completed on April 30, 2008. We received proceeds of $185 million for this transaction, which were recorded as a reduction to Operating Costs. Group Medicare Advantage plans offered through commercial contracts were excluded from the divestiture. Also, we retained Sierras Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Nevada. The results of operations and financial condition of Sierra have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. Fiserv Health, Inc. On January 10, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Fiserv Health, Inc. (Fiserv Health), a subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc., for approximately $740 million in cash. Fiserv Health is a leading administrator of medical benefits and also provides care facilitation services, specialty health solutions and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. This transaction allows us to expand the capacity of our existing benefits administration businesses and enables existing and new customers to leverage our full range of assets, including ancillary services, our national network and technology tools. The results of operations and financial condition of Fiserv Health have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, aggregate consideration paid, net of cash assumed for smaller acquisitions was $95 million, $94 million and $262 million, respectively. These acquisitions were not material to our results of operations. 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in risk based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market. The effect of 2008 Health Benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk based businesses, elevated medical costs due to the H1N1 influenza virus, unemployment related benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $310 million and $230 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management, which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums, a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate. 35 Table of Contents Operating costs for 2008 included $882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out of network medical services, $50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008. Income Tax Rate Our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate, which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice; OptumHealth; Ingenix; and Prescription Solutions. Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 36 Table of Contents The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Revenues Health Benefits $ 81,341 $ 75,857 $ 71,199 $ 5,484 7 % $ 4,658 7 % OptumHealth 5,528 5,225 4,921 303 6 304 6 Ingenix 1,823 1,552 1,304 271 17 248 19 Prescription Solutions 14,452 12,573 13,249 1,879 15 (676 ) (5 ) Eliminations (16,006 ) (14,021 ) (15,242 ) (1,985 ) nm 1,221 nm Consolidated revenues $ 87,138 $ 81,186 $ 75,431 $ 5,952 7 % $ 5,755 8 % Earnings from Operations Health Benefits $ 4,788 $ 5,068 $ 6,595 $ (280 ) (6 )% $ (1,527 ) (23 )% OptumHealth 636 718 895 (82 ) (11 ) (177 ) (20 ) Ingenix 246 229 266 17 7 (37 ) (14 ) Prescription Solutions 689 363 269 326 90 94 35 Corporate (1,115 ) (176 ) 1,115 nm (939 ) nm Consolidated earnings from operations $ 6,359 $ 5,263 $ 7,849 $ 1,096 21 % $ (2,586 ) (33 )% Operating Margin Health Benefits 5.9 % 6.7 % 9.3 % (0.8 )% (2.6 )% OptumHealth 11.5 13.7 18.2 (2.2 ) (4.5 ) Ingenix 13.5 14.8 20.4 (1.3 ) (5.6 ) Prescription Solutions 4.8 2.9 2.0 1.9 0.9 Consolidated operating margin 7.3 % 6.5 % 10.4 % 0.8 % (3.9 )% nm not meaningful The following summarizes the number of individuals served by our Health Benefits segment, by major market segment and funding arrangement, at December 31: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Commercial risk based 9,415 10,360 10,805 (945 ) (9 )% (445 ) (4 )% Commercial fee based 15,210 15,985 14,720 (775 ) (5 ) 1,265 9 Total commercial 24,625 26,345 25,525 (1,720 ) (7 ) 820 3 Medicare Advantage 1,790 1,495 1,370 295 20 125 9 Medicaid 2,900 2,515 1,710 385 15 805 47 Standardized Medicare supplement 2,680 2,540 2,400 140 6 140 6 Total public and senior 7,370 6,550 5,480 820 13 1,070 20 Total people served by Health Benefits 31,995 32,895 31,005 (900 ) (3 )% 1,890 6 % 37 Table of Contents Health Benefits Revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income driven by lower short term investment yields. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $40.8 billion for 2009 decreased by $1.0 billion, or 2%, compared to 2008, as the reduction in individuals served was partially offset by premium rate increases. Ovations revenues of $32.1 billion for 2009 increased by $4.1 billion, or 15%, over 2008, primarily due to an increase in individuals served through Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare Supplement offerings, as well as premium rate increases. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $8.4 billion for 2009, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 40%, over the comparable 2008 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans and premium rate increases as well as the full year impact from the mid 2008 Unison acquisition. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a $166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business, partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses. The 2009 UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 84.0% from 83.5% in 2008, largely due to elevated medical costs related to the H1N1 influenza virus and a higher proportion of participants receiving care under unemployment related benefit continuation programs. Health Benefits operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations. OptumHealth Increased OptumHealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in large scale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients, which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, OptumHealth provided services to approximately 58 million and 60 million consumers, respectively. Earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above, start up costs for new large contracts and lower investment income, partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management. Ingenix Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business, new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions. The decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings, including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion, hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $12.6 billion and $11.0 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, strong success under performance based purchasing arrangements, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. 38 Table of Contents 2008 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2007 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The premium revenue growth generated by our Health Benefits reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase. This increase was due to the growth in individuals served by public and senior markets businesses, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in 2008, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Investment and Other Income. The decrease in investment and other income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily because of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents, decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows, decreased deposits held for certain government sponsored programs and increased other than temporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2008 increased primarily due to medical cost inflation, acquisitions completed in 2008 and growth in Ovations Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. For 2008 and 2007, medical costs included $230 million and $420 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio increased in 2008 primarily due to certain expenses as described in 2009 Results of Operations Compared to 2008 Results above, acquisitions completed in 2008, costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from fee based businesses. Operating costs for 2007 include $176 million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to our historical stock option practices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. For an expanded discussion of our Section 409A charges, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements, as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to business acquisitions. Income Tax Rate The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of tax free investment income to total earnings. 39 Table of Contents Reporting Segments Health Benefits The revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our Public and Senior Markets Group, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the 2008 acquisitions of Sierra, Fiserv Health, and Unison, partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial risk based products and Medicare Part D products and a decrease in investment income. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $41.8 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 4%. The UnitedHealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for Health Benefits in 2008. Ovations revenues of $28.1 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products gained through both organic growth and the Sierra acquisition and premium rate increases, which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of 675,000 stand alone Medicare Part D members primarily due to the reassignment by CMS of certain dual eligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $6.0 billion in 2008, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 34%, over the comparable 2007 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans, premium rate increases and the acquisition of Unison in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the UnitedHealthcare risk based business and pressure on gross margins in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, partially offset by acquisitions. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 83.5% in 2008 from 82.6% in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases, net of customer benefit package changes, did not fully match the rise in medical costs, and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business, which typically carries a higher medical care ratio. Health Benefits operating margin was 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease from 9.3% in 2007 primarily driven by the factors discussed above. The number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions, which included the addition of 1,315,000 fee based members from Fiserv Health and the addition of 310,000 risk based individuals gained through the Sierra acquisition. These additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of 805,000, or 3%, from December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial risk based products and the impact of a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products at December 31, 2008 increased through the addition of 60,000 seniors from our acquisition of Sierra and organic growth of 95,000 seniors, partially offset by the divestiture of 30,000 individuals in Nevada related to the Sierra acquisition. Medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of 320,000 and 60,000 individuals from our Unison and Sierra acquisitions, respectively, and strong organic growth of 425,000 individuals. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment. OptumHealth provided services to approximately 60 million consumers at December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 1 million individuals year over year. Earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for risk based behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business. Ingenix The improvement in Ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions. The decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during 2008 for certain research projects, which were cancelled, as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment. 40 Table of Contents Prescription Solutions The decreased Prescription Solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dual eligible beneficiaries described above through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization, partially offset by revenues related to the Fiserv Health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $11.0 billion and $12.4 billion for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the Fiserv Health acquisition, gains in mail service drug fulfillment, and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation, amortization and other non cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The diversity of our businesses, our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk based businesses, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs, partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term, investment grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2009, based on the 2008 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid was $3.1 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. The increase in the proportion of extraordinary dividends to total dividends in 2009 primarily reflects the acceleration of dividend timing, as well as the size of specific dividends beyond ordinary levels. Given expected statutory capital levels, we anticipate lower overall regulated subsidiary dividends in 2010. 41 Table of Contents Our non regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions, repaying debt and or repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Results A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sources of Cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 5,625 $ 4,238 $ 5,877 Sales of investments 4,040 5,568 1,271 Maturities of investments 2,675 3,030 2,094 Issuance of long term debt 2,981 3,582 Interest rate swap termination 513 Other 546 1,770 1,962 Total sources of cash 13,399 17,587 14,786 Uses of Cash: Purchases of investments (6,466 ) (9,251 ) (6,379 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and disposition (486 ) (3,813 ) (262 ) Retirement of long term debt (1,350 ) (500 ) (950 ) Common stock repurchases (1,801 ) (2,684 ) (6,599 ) Repayments of commercial paper, net (99 ) (1,346 ) Other (823 ) (1,432 ) (2,051 ) Total uses of cash (11,025 ) (19,026 ) (16,241 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash $ 2,374 $ (1,439 ) $ (1,455 ) 2009 Cash Flows Compared To 2008 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.4 billion, or 33%, primarily due to the payment in 2008 of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices, the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in risk based products in the public and senior markets businesses, and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with CMS related to Medicare Part D. Additionally, we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts. We anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings, the timing of certain CMS payments and the impact of a legislated change to the timing of payments for Medicare Part D claims. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $4.1 billion, or 81%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments, which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $1.7 billion due to the issuance of long term debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our policy on offsetting cash balances. These items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts. 42 Table of Contents 2008 Cash Flows Compared To 2007 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.6 billion, or 28%, primarily due to the decrease in net earnings, which included payments for the settlement of two class action lawsuits described above. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $925 million, or 22%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and increases in the usage of cash in 2008 for purchases of investments offset by the 2008 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $2.6 billion, or 81%, primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases in 2008 offset by the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalent and available for sale investment balances of $24.2 billion included $9.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (which included $2.3 billion held by non regulated entities), $13.8 billion of debt securities and $577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2009. Included in the debt securities balance were $3.0 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties. A number of different guarantors guarantee the securities, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is AA as of December 31, 2009. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and significant cash and cash equivalent balances at our regulated and unregulated entities, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities of up to 270 days through third party broker dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Bank Credit Facility. We have a five year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2009. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.4% to 0.7%. Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio below 50%. Our debt to total capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders equity, was 32.1% and 38.1% as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. We complied with the requirements of all debt covenants as of December 31, 2009. 43 Table of Contents Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S 3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of debt securities. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt Baa1 Stable A Negative A Negative Commercial paper P 2 n/a A 2 n/a F1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes. We believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost. We used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market. In 2009, we repurchased 74.3 million shares at an average price of approximately $24 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2009, we had Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 28.7 million shares of our common stock. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2009, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2010 2011 to 2012 2013 to 2014 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 2,164 $ 1,361 $ 1,559 $ 6,089 $ 11,173 Interest on debt (b) 545 659 406 3,549 5,159 Operating leases 255 420 272 644 1,591 Purchase obligations (c) 115 31 146 Future policy benefits (d) 139 353 337 1,152 1,981 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 19 104 123 Unfunded investment commitments (f) 138 42 24 16 220 Other obligations (g) 210 80 252 542 Total contractual obligations $ 3,585 $ 2,946 $ 2,598 $ 11,806 $ 20,935 (a) See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (b) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term, including the effect of the debt tender described in Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For variable rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2009 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. Includes unamortized discounts from par values. (c) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009. 44 Table of Contents (d) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long term portion has been classified as Thereafter. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and the investment commitment related to the PacifiCare acquisition. (g) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration related to a business acquisition, certain employee benefit programs, and charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs and the charitable contributions have been classified as Thereafter. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2009, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009 13). This update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables relative selling price. The provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2009 13. We have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, or do not apply to our operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but 45 Table of Contents not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2009, 2008 and 2007, included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $310 million, $230 million and $420 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36 month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2009: Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 171 (0.50) 114 (0.25) 57 0.25 (57 ) 0.50 (113 ) 0.75 (169 ) 46 Table of Contents Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2009: Medical Cost PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 332 2 222 1 111 (1) (111 ) (2) (222 ) (3) (332 ) The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2009, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2009; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2009 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2009 net earnings would increase or decrease by $52 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.04 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. 47 Table of Contents CMS deploys a risk adjustment model, which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. We and other health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a two step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting units assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2010 and determined that no impairment existed as of December 31, 2009. Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by potential health care reforms as discussed in Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes above, as any passed legislation may significantly change the forecasts and long term growth rate assumptions for some or all of our reporting units. Intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., customer lists and trademarks). We do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. We calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. We consider many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year. 48 Table of Contents Investments As of December 31, 2009, we had investments with a carrying value of $14.6 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2009, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $493 million and gross unrealized losses of $50 million. We evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. 49 Table of Contents The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2009 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $58 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A. As of December 31, 2009, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2009, $9.8 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $750 million of our debt as of December 31, 2009 was at interest rates that vary with market rates. The fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, $14.0 billion of our investments were fixed rate debt securities and $10.4 billion of our debt was fixed rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time in normal markets, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap 50 Table of Contents contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. In January 2009, we terminated interest rate swap contracts with $4.9 billion in notional value to lock in the benefit of low market interest rates. This gain will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixed rate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2009 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments Fair Value ofDebt 2% $ 196 $ 15 $ (1,059 ) $ (1,187 ) 1 98 8 (540 ) (633 ) (1) (15 ) (6 ) 541 730 (2) nm nm 1,075 1,579 nm not meaningful (a) Given the low absolute level of short term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2009, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates has been floored at zero and does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense. As of December 31, 2009, we had $577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments. 51 Table of Contents
