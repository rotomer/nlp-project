EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well being company, whose focus is on improving the overall health and well being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost; support the physician/patient relationship; and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to help make health care work better. These core competencies are focused in two market areas, health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. In aggregate, these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets. Each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well being: access, affordability, quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from fee based services performed for customers that self insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants. For both risk based and fee based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from Ingenix health intelligence and consulting businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities. Our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold, or other than temporarily impaired. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider 37 Table of Contents contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government sponsored public sector programs and recently enacted Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. In 2011, we expect consumer usage of the health system to increase, resuming its upward growth pattern from the recent moderation in utilization growth. We will work to manage medical cost trends through affordable network relationships, pay for performance reimbursement programs for care providers, and targeted clinical initiatives around improving quality and affordability. However, an increase in utilization will likely result in increased medical costs and an increase in our medical care ratio. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio. Cash Flows We generate cash primarily from premiums, service and product revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs, payments on debt, purchases of investments, acquisitions, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. For more information on our cash flows, see Liquidity below. 2011 Business Realignment On January 1, 2011, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. For example, in 2011 OptumHealths results of operations will include our clinical services assets, including Southwest Medical multi specialty clinics in Nevada and our Evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly, which had historically been reported in UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual and UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, respectively. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individuals results of operations will include OptumHealth Specialty Benefits, including dental, vision, life and disability. There were no changes to our reportable segments as a result of these changes. Our periodic filings beginning with our first quarter 2011 Form 10 Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 18% of U.S. gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in 38 Table of Contents the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro economic conditions and enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Health Care Reforms. In the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. HHS, the DOL and the Treasury Department have issued regulations (or proposed regulations) on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation, all of which have a variety of effective dates. We operate a diversified set of businesses that focus on health care, and our business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium rate increases for certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs or expose us to an increased risk of liability, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We also anticipate that the Health Reform Legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality, as well as in prevention, wellness and disease management. We believe demand for many of our service offerings, such as consulting services, data management, information technology and related infrastructure construction, disease management, and population based health and wellness programs will continue to grow. Beginning in 2011, health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals) will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Rebate payments, if any, for 2011 would be made in mid 2012. The potential for and size of the rebates will be measured at the market level, by state and by licensed subsidiary. This disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in estimates of rebates owed in total. In the aggregate, the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained. Depending on the results of the calculation, there is a broad range of potential rebate and other business impacts and there could be meaningful disruption in local health care markets if companies decide to adjust their offerings in response to these requirements. For example, companies could elect to change pricing, modify product features or benefits, adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market. Companies could also seek to adjust their operating costs to support reduced premiums by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non medical product features and services. Companies continue to face a significant amount of uncertainty given the breadth of possible changes, including changes in the competitive environment, state rate approval, fluctuations in medical costs, the statistical variation that results from assessing business by state, by license and by market and the potential for meaningful market disruption in 2011 and 2012. We have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to this legislation, including reducing broker commissions, and are evaluating changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment. These changes could impact future growth in these products. Other market participants could also implement changes to their business practices in response to this legislation, which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share. The Health Reform Legislation also requires HHS to maintain an annual review of unreasonable increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS recently proposed a regulation that defines a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10%, and the proposed rule clarifies that the HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes. The proposed regulation further requires health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10% or more. The 39 Table of Contents Federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases and providing funding to assist in those state level reviews. Ultimately, rate approval responsibility still lies with the states under the proposed regulation. Depending on the level of anticipated increased scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression. Effective in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs and 7% on generic prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This statutory reduction in drug prices for seniors in the coverage gap may cause people who may have had difficulty affording their medications to increase their pharmaceutical usage. The change in pricing could also have secondary effects, such as changing the mix of brand name and generic drug usage by seniors. We have incorporated the anticipated impact of these changes in our 2011 product pricing and pharmacy benefit management business plan. As part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. Separately, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of 1.6% for 2011. We expect the 2011 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage plans will take effect (plans will ultimately receive 95% of Medicare fee for service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased in over two to six years, depending on the level of payment reduction in a county. All of these changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels. There are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we can adjust members benefits, decide on a county by county basis which geographies to participate in and seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management. Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses. Quality bonus payments may further offset these anticipated rate reductions as CMS quality rating bonus payments are phased in over three years beginning in 2012. We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the anticipated increase in the number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Part D and Medicare Supplement insurance offerings. The Health Reform Legislation presents additional opportunities and challenges over the longer term, including the assessment of an annual $8 billion insurance industry assessment beginning in 2014, the operation of state based exchanges for individuals and small businesses beginning in 2014, and numerous other commercial and governmental plan requirements. Individual states may also accelerate their procurement of Medicaid managed care services for sizeable groups of Medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads when Medicaid market expansions take place in 2014. The law could increase near term business growth opportunities for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Due to the complexity of the health care system and the numerous changes that are taking place, the longer term effect of the new legislation remains difficult to assess. Court proceedings related to the Health Reform Legislation, such as the ruling by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida (in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general and or governors) that declared the entire legislation unconstitutional, and the potential for Congressional action to impede implementation, create additional uncertainties with respect to the law. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation and the related risk factors, see Item 1, Business Government Regulation and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our customers, and have put pressure on our overall growth and 40 Table of Contents operating profitability. If the current economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Government funding pressure, coupled with adverse economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to current economic conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I.

Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth. Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs. For 2010 and 2009, there was $800 million and $310 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in 2010 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels; more efficient claims handling and processing, which results in higher completion factors; a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state based assessments. The medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services, successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses, which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses, goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at Ingenix, which is discussed in more detail below, an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the Medicare Advantage annual enrollment period, costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation, increased advertising costs, and the absorption of new business development and start up costs. Income Tax Rate The increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the Health Reform Legislation. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community & State; OptumHealth; Ingenix; and Prescription Solutions. 42 Table of Contents See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues. Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at managements estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

In 2010, revenues were $41.2 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $35.9 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $10.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. In 2009, revenues were $40.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $32.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $8.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Health Benefits earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above, continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental customers, a general moderation in year over year growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth for 2010 were driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets, partially offset by a loss of some smaller specialty benefits customers. The operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business, new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the Mental Health Parity Act. Ingenix Increased revenues in Ingenix for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance. The decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3 branded clinical trial service businesses. In addition, increases in the mix of lower margin business, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business and higher prescription volumes. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $14.5 billion and $12.6 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Prescription Solutions operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performance based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management. 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in 44 Table of Contents risk based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market. The effect of 2008 Health Benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk based businesses, elevated medical costs due to the H1N1 influenza virus, unemployment related benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $310 million and $230 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management, which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums, a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate. Operating costs for 2008 included $882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out of network medical services, $50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008. Income Tax Rate Our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate, which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes. Reporting Segments Health Benefits Revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income driven by lower short term investment yields. 2009 revenues were $40.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $32.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $8.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. 2008 revenues were $41.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $28.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $6.0 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a $166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business, partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses. Health Benefits operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations. 45 Table of Contents OptumHealth Increased OptumHealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in large scale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients, which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. Earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above, start up costs for new large contracts and lower investment income, partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management. Ingenix Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business, new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions. The decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings, including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion, hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $12.6 billion and $11.0 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, strong success under performance based purchasing arrangements, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our businesses while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non cash expenses. The risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses, geographies and customers; our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk based businesses; and continued productivity improvements in our operating costs. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term, liquid, investment grade, debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in 46 Table of Contents the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiarys level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2010, based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was $3.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion, including $686 million of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. The total dividends received in both 2010 and 2009 included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. In some cases, ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and or accelerated timing. Our non regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Results A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 6,273 $ 5,625 $ 4,238 Sales of investments 2,593 4,040 5,568 Maturities of investments 3,105 2,675 3,030 Proceeds from customer funds administered 974 204 0 Proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, net 930 0 0 Proceeds from issuance of long term debt 747 0 2,981 Interest rate swap termination 0 513 0 Other 299 342 1,770 Total sources of cash 14,921 13,399 17,587 Uses of cash: Purchases of investments (7,855 ) (6,466 ) (9,251 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and disposition (2,304 ) (486 ) (3,813 ) Retirement of long term debt (1,583 ) (1,350 ) (500 ) Common stock repurchases (2,517 ) (1,801 ) (2,684 ) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (878 ) (739 ) (791 ) Dividends paid (449 ) (36 ) (37 ) Repayments of commercial paper, net 0 (99 ) (1,346 ) Other (12 ) (48 ) (604 ) Total uses of cash (15,598 ) (11,025 ) (19,026 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash $ (677 ) $ 2,374 $ (1,439 ) 47 Table of Contents 2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $648 million, or 12%, for 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings, an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments, and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program and payment for the settlement of the American Medical Association class action litigation related to reimbursement for out of network medical services. We anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings and the early receipt of certain 2011 premium payments in late 2010. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010, decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and uses of operating cash to purchase investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $664 million, or 29%, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock. 2009 Cash Flows Compared To 2008 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.4 billion, or 33%, primarily due to the payment in 2008 of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices, the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in risk based products in the public and senior markets businesses, and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with CMS related to Medicare Part D. Additionally, we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $4.1 billion, or 81%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments, which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $1.7 billion due to the issuance of long term debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. These items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalent and available for sale investment balances of $25.7 billion included $9.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $974 million was held by non regulated entities), $16.1 billion of debt securities and $516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.5 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of 2.2 years and a weighted average credit rating of AA as of December 31, 2010. Included in the debt securities balance are $2.7 billion of 48 Table of Contents state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is AA as of December 31, 2010. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt through third party broker dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We had $930 million of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Our issuance of commercial paper in 2010 was to maintain ample liquidity at the holding company level. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $2.5 billion five year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. As of December 31, 2010, the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.5% to 0.7%. Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio below 50%. Our debt to total capital ratio, calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity, was 30.1% and 32.1% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2010. Debt Issuance. In October 2010, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes under our February 2008 S 3 shelf registration statement. The issuance included $450 million of 3.875% fixed rate notes due October 2020 and $300 million of 5.700% fixed rate notes due October 2040. We intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch (a) A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt Baa1 Stable A Stable A Negative bbb+ Stable Commercial paper P 2 n/a A 2 n/a F1 n/a AMB 2 n/a (a) On January 12, 2011, Fitch updated their ratings outlook on our senior unsecured debt to stable. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions to maintain financial flexibility and mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, subject to certain preset parameters. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. In 2010, we repurchased 76 million shares at an average price of approximately $33 per share and an aggregate cost of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 48 million shares of our common stock. 49 Table of Contents Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes. We believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost. We used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes. Dividends. In May 2010, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders and moved us to a quarterly dividend payment cycle. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends are at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. Prior to May 2010, our policy had been to pay an annual dividend. The following table provides details of our dividend payments: Year AggregateAmount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) 2008 $ 0.030 $ 37 2009 0.030 36 2010 0.405 449 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2010, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2011 2012 to 2013 2014 to 2015 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 3,008 $ 2,228 $ 1,780 $ 11,360 $ 18,376 Operating leases 259 431 285 579 1,554 Purchase obligations (b) 264 114 5 1 384 Future policy benefits (c) 126 356 380 1,625 2,487 Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 20 0 0 147 167 Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) 364 100 0 2,268 2,732 Other obligations (f) 76 88 72 12 248 Total contractual obligations $ 4,117 $ 3,317 $ 2,522 $ 15,992 $ 25,948 (a) Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. Coupon payments have been calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2010 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010. (c) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts and health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long term portion has been classified as Thereafter. 50 Table of Contents (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition, interest rate swaps and various other long term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as Thereafter. (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2010, we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have determined that there have been no recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to our operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions. Each period, we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs 51 Table of Contents is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2010, 2009 and 2008, included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $800 million, $310 million and $230 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36 month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2010: Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 186 (0.50) 124 (0.25) 62 0.25 (61 ) 0.50 (122 ) 0.75 (183 ) Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2010: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 366 2 244 1 122 (1) (122 ) (2) (244 ) (3) (366 ) The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents managements best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2010, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes 52 Table of Contents the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2010; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2010 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2010 net earnings would increase or decrease by $51 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.05 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. Beginning in 2011, premium revenue subject to the medical loss ratio rebates of the Health Reform Legislation will be recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract, if that amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated premium will be revised each period to reflect current experience. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model, which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. We and other health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for additional information regarding these audits. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether 53 Table of Contents goodwill is impaired, we perform a two step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting units assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2011, which considered our business realignment, and determined that other than the $172 million impairment related to certain of Ingenixs businesses, no goodwill impairment existed as of December 31, 2010. Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, Business Government Regulation. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms could affect our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I. Intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts and trademarks). We do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible assets (or asset groups) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. We calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. We consider many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year. Investments As of December 31, 2010, we had investments with a carrying value of $16.8 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2010, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $527 million and gross unrealized losses of $81 million. We evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the 54 Table of Contents security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity securitys cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2010 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $74 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. 55 Table of Contents LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference in this report. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as A. As of December 31, 2010, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2010, $9.1 billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $7.1 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2010 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, $16.3 billion of our investments was fixed rate debt securities and $4.0 billion of our debt was fixed rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. Our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments Fair Value ofDebt 2% $ 182 $ 163 $ (1,177 ) $ (860 ) 1 91 82 (602 ) (471 ) (1) (10 ) (21 ) 613 560 (2) nm nm 1,227 1,240 nm not meaningful (a) Given the low absolute level of short term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2010, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero. As of December 31, 2010, we had $516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments. 57 Table of Contents
