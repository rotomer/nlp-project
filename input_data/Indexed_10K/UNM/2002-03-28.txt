ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction On June 30, 1999, Unum Corporation (Unum) merged with and into Provident Companies, Inc. (Provident) under the name UnumProvident Corporation. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. The historical financial results discussed herein give effect to the merger as if it had been completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented. See Notes 1 and 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion. The following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein in Item 8. The trends in new annualized sales in the Employee Benefits, Individual, and Voluntary Benefits segments are indicators of the Companys potential for growth in its respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new products. The Company emphasizes integrated selling that combines employee benefit coverages, individual products, and voluntary workplace products. The Company has closely linked its various incentive compensation programs to the achievement of its goals for new sales and persistency. Critical Accounting Policies Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits The two primary categories of liabilities for policy and contract benefits are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred and have future benefits to be paid. Policy reserves equal the present value of the difference between future policy benefits and expenses and future premiums, allowing a margin for profit. These reserves are applicable for the majority of the Companys business, which is traditional non interest sensitive in nature. The claim payments are estimated using assumptions established when the policy was issued. Generally accepted accounting principles require that these assumptions not be subsequently modified unless the policy reserves are determined to be inadequate. Throughout the life of the policy, the reserve is based on the original assumptions used for the policys issue year. A claim reserve is established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Policy reserves for a particular policy continue to be maintained after a claim reserve has been established. Claim reserves generally equal the Companys estimate, at the current reporting period, of the present value of the liability for future benefits to be paid on a claim. A claim reserve for a specific claim is based on assumptions derived from the Companys actual historical experience as to claim duration as well as the specific circumstances of the claimant such as benefits available under the policy, the covered benefit period and the age and occupation of the claimant. Consideration is given to historical trends in the Companys experience and to expected deviations from historical experience that result from changes in benefits available, changes in the Companys risk management policies and procedures, and other economic, environmental, or societal factors. Reserves for claims that are estimated to have already been incurred but that have not yet been reported to the Company are based on factors such as historical claim reporting patterns, the average cost of claims, and the expected volumes of incurred claims. Claim reserves, unlike policy reserves, are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors impacting claim experience change. The Company reviews annually, or more frequently as appropriate, emerging experience to ensure that its claim reserves provide the Companys current estimate of adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits. This review includes the determination of a range of reasonable estimates within which the reserve must fall. 18 Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs The Company defers certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortizes (expenses) these costs over the life of the related policies. The Company uses its own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of its business in determining the expected life of the policies. Approximately 94 percent of the Companys deferred policy acquisition costs relates to traditional non interest sensitive products, for which the costs are amortized in proportion to the estimated premium income to be received over the life of the policies. The estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is higher than in the later years due to anticipated policy lapses, which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy. Amortization of deferred costs on traditional products is adjusted annually to reflect the actual policy lapse experience as compared to the anticipated experience. The Company will experience increased amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected. Deferred costs related to group and individual disability products are amortized over a twenty year period. Approximately 60 percent and 85 percent of the original deferred costs related to group disability products are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen, respectively. For individual disability policies, approximately 50 percent and 70 percent of the original deferred costs are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen, respectively. Deferred costs for group life products are amortized over a fifteen year period, with approximately 20 percent of the cost expected to remain at year ten. Valuation of Fixed Maturity Securities In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, the Company evaluates market conditions, relevant industry conditions and trends, rating agency actions, offering prices, trends of earnings, and other key measures for the related security. When a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period results to the extent of the decline in value. Private placement fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of approximately $4.2 billion, or 17.0 percent of total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2001, do not have readily determinable market prices. For these securities, the Company uses internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. All such investments are classified as available for sale. The Companys ability to liquidate its positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market, and the Company may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner. Although the Company believes its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors may not reflect those of an active market. The Company believes that generally these private placement securities carry a credit quality comparable to companies rated Baa by major credit rating organizations. As of December 31, 2001, the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following: . Risk free interest rates of 4.30 percent for five year maturities to 5.47 percent for 30 year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for U.S. Treasury Bonds with similar maturities. . Current Baa corporate bond spreads ranging from 1.48 percent to 2.99 percent plus an additional 30 basis points were added to the risk free rate to consider the lack of liquidity. . An additional ten basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments. . Additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk. Historically, the Companys realized gains or losses on dispositions of its private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above. 19 Reinsurance Receivable Reinsurance is a contractual agreement whereby the Companys reinsurance partners assume a defined portion of the risk for future benefits payable under reinsurance contracts. The reinsurance receivable reported as an asset in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition includes amounts due from the Companys reinsurers on current claims and estimates of amounts that will be due on future claims. Policy reserves and claim reserves reported in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition are not reduced for reinsurance. The reinsurance receivable is generally equal to the policy reserves and claim reserves related to the risk being reinsured. The Company reduces the reinsurance receivable if recovery is not likely due to the financial position of the reinsurer or if there is disagreement between the Company and the reinsurer regarding the liability of the reinsurer. Results of Operations 2001 Significant Transactions and Events The September 11, 2001 tragedy resulted in a 2001 before tax charge of $24.0 million, or $15.6 million after tax. This charge included estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of $65.0 million less an estimated $41.0 million recoverable from the Companys reinsurers. The charge did not include any indirect costs which the Company incurred in developing specialized procedures for filing claims resulting from the attacks and in providing additional support to impacted policyholders and group clients. The Companys reinsurance program provides a significant layer of catastrophic coverage for its individual disability and its group life, accidental death and dismemberment, travel accident, long term disability, and short term disability lines of business through a group of highly rated major national and international reinsurance organizations. Because of the quality and level of the Companys various reinsurance coverages, the Company does not anticipate that any of its reinsurers will be unable to cover the claims incurred as a result of the events. Should this occur, however, all of the Companys insurance subsidiaries are sufficiently capitalized such that each insurance subsidiary will be able to satisfy these claims and will face no liquidity or risk based capital issues. The effects on each line of business are disclosed in the following discussions of segment operating results. During 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to limit its liabilities pertaining to the Lloyds syndicate participations. Separately, the Company also reinsured 100 percent of the group disability reinsurance reserves and all future business underwritten and managed by Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc., a subsidiary of D&H. The transaction, in which reserves of approximately $323.8 million were ceded to the reinsurer, had an effective date of January 1, 2001. In a separate but related transaction, the Company also sold the reinsurance management operations of Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc. and divested the remaining assets of that facility. During 2001, the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis certain cancer policies written by one of the Companys insurance subsidiaries and ceded approximately $113.6 million of reserves to the reinsurer. The transaction had an effective date of November 1, 2001. In 2001, the Company acquired the assets of EmployeeLife.com, an Internet Capital Group partner company. This new subsidiary, Benefit Technologies, Inc. (doing business under the name BenefitAmerica), will enhance customer service by offering Internet business solutions to help employers efficiently manage and administer employee benefits. The Company also acquired Resource Opportunities, Inc. (ROI), a national provider of medical and vocational case management services. ROI will improve GENEXs ability to service its customers, in turn benefiting the Companys insurance customers. Also in 2001, the Company sold Provident National Assurance Company, an inactive insurance subsidiary. Provident National Assurance Companys general account liabilities were reinsured by another subsidiary of the Company, and the excess capital and surplus was transferred to the parent to reduce short term borrowings. During 2001, the Company wrote off the remaining goodwill balance related to its operations in Argentina, resulting in a decrease in before tax and after tax operating income of $5.4 million. In 2001, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $35.2 million related to its investment in the foreign reinsurance operations, which lowered the 2001 tax rate below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35 percent. Additionally, as a 20 result of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom during 2000 that allows additional group tax relief among companies with common ownership, the Company began recognizing foreign tax benefits during 2001. During 2001 the Company redeemed its $172.5 million par value 8.8% monthly income debt securities (junior subordinated debt), which were due in 2025 but callable at par in 2000 and thereafter. This early redemption is expected to lower the Companys financing costs in 2002 through the use of commercial paper available at lower interest rates. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a write off of the remaining deferred debt cost of $4.5 million associated with the issuance of the securities. The extraordinary loss, net of a $1.6 million tax benefit, was $2.9 million. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141), Business Combinations, and No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. Application of the non amortization provision is expected to increase 2002 earnings $21.3 million before tax and $20.2 million after tax. In connection with the initial adoption of SFAS 142, the Company will perform the required transitional goodwill impairment tests. Any impairment loss resulting from the transitional goodwill impairment tests will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle and will be presented as a separate caption, net of tax, in the income statement. The impairment loss, if any, is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 2000 Significant Transactions and Events During 2000, the Company completed a series of strategic transactions designed to more closely focus its operations on its core businesses, increase its financial flexibility, support its present credit and claims paying ratings, increase the risk based capital ratios of the insurance subsidiaries involved, and lower its leverage ratios. The primary transaction involved agreements under which the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis substantially all of the individual life insurance and corporate owned life insurance policies written by the Companys insurance subsidiaries, as well as a small block of individually underwritten group life insurance. The reinsurance agreements were effective as of July 1, 2000. Separately, the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis the future claim payments on one of the Companys insurance subsidiaries long duration group long term disability claims that were incurred prior to January 1, 1996. The agreement was effective January 1, 2000. During 2000, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement under which one of the Companys insurance subsidiaries will cede through a net quota share reinsurance agreement 50 percent of the group life volume above the aggregate retention limit. The treaties are five year quota share treaties ceding 25 percent of premium, life volume, and paid claims to each reinsurer. The reinsurance agreements were effective as of October 1, 2000. During 2000, the Company purchased a single premium annuity for its retirees, which allowed the release of the related pension plan liability and resulted in a net before tax gain of $116.1 million. The pension plan transaction enabled the Company to provide a higher level of administrative service for its retirees while also locking in favorable pension plan performance. Also in 2000, the Company increased reserves $65.6 million in the Companys long term disability business and $21.9 million in the reinsurance operations, wrote off assets and established loss provisions of $15.5 million in the reinsurance operations, and accrued consolidation and benefit expenses of $9.4 million. See the discussions of segment operating results contained herein for further information. 1999 Significant Transactions and Events As a result of the aforementioned merger at June 30, 1999, certain accounting policy changes were made during 1999. The following summarizes these changes as well as the expenses related to the merger and the early retirement offer to employees. Generally, because of the effort and time involved, reviews and updates of assumptions related to benefit liabilities are periodically undertaken over time and are reflected in the calculation of benefit liabilities as completed. Many 21 factors influence assumptions underlying reserves, and considerable judgment is required to interpret current and historical experience underlying all of the assumptions and to assess the future factors that are likely to influence the ultimate cost of settling existing claims. Prior to the June 30, 1999 merger, Unums process and assumptions used to calculate the discount rate for claim reserves of certain disability businesses differed from that used by Provident. While Unums and Providents methods for calculating the discount rate for disability claim reserves were both in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management believed that the combined entity should have consistent discount rate accounting policies and methods for applying these policies for similar products. The previous Unum methodology used the same investment strategy for assets backing both liabilities and surplus. Providents methodology, which allows for different investment strategies for assets backing surplus than those backing product liabilities, was determined by management to be the more appropriate approach for the combined entity. Accordingly, at June 30, 1999, the Company adopted Providents method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves. The impact on 1999 earnings related to the change in method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves was $240.7 million before tax and $156.5 million after tax. The charge was reflected in the Employee Benefits, Individual, and Other segments as an increase in benefits to policyholders of $191.7 million, $38.9 million, and $10.1 million, respectively. Subsequent to the merger date, the Company began to integrate the valuation procedures of the two organizations to provide for a more effective linking of pricing and reserving assumptions and to facilitate a more efficient process for adjusting liabilities to emerging trends. Included in this integration activity were a review and an update of assumptions that underlie policy and contract benefit liabilities. The purpose of the study was to confirm or update the assumptions which were viewed as likely to affect the ultimate liability for contract benefits. Accordingly, as a result of the merger, the Company accelerated the performance of its normal reviews of the assumptions underlying reserves to determine the assumptions that the newly merged Company will use in the future for pricing, performance management, and reserving. The review resulted in an increase in the benefits and reserves for future benefits for the Companys domestic group long term disability unpaid claim liabilities. As a result of the review, the Company increased its policy and contract benefit liabilities $359.2 million in the third quarter of 1999, which reduced 1999 results $359.2 million before tax and $233.5 million after tax. During 1999, the Company recorded before tax expenses related to the merger of approximately $184.7 million ($139.6 million after tax) for severance and related costs, exit costs for duplicate facilities and asset abandonments, and investment banking, legal, and accounting fees. The Company also recorded in 1999 a before tax expense of approximately $125.9 million ($81.8 million after tax) related to the early retirement offer to the Companys employees. These expenses are reported in the Corporate segment as other operating expenses and are further discussed in the section "Corporate Segment Operating Results." Additionally, in 1999 the Company expensed $24.7 million ($16.1 million after tax) of incremental costs associated with the merger. These incremental costs consist primarily of compensation, training, integration, and licensing costs. See Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of these charges and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion of capital and financing needs. During 1999 the Company also recognized $327.8 million of before tax charges related to its reinsurance operations. These charges were as follows (in millions of dollars): North American Reinsurance Operations Loss on Sale of A&H and LTC Reinsurance Management $ 12.9 Operations (includes write off of $6.0 million of goodwill) Loss on Reinsurance of A&H and LTC Risk Participations 12.7 Provision for Losses on Retained Business 42.1 International Reinsurance Operations Provision for Losses on Lloyds of London Syndicate Participations 186.5 Provision for Losses on Reinsurance Pool Participations Other than Lloyds 21.9 Goodwill Impairment Excluding Amount Recognized on Sale 51.7 Total Before tax Charge $327.8 22 See "Other Segment Operating Results" and Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of these charges and the Companys reinsurance operations. A portion of the losses recognized in 1999 relating to the Companys reinsurance operations does not receive a tax benefit, which unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate. Additionally, a portion of the 1999 expenses related to the merger was non deductible for federal income tax purposes, resulting in a 1999 tax rate that was less than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. In 1999, the Company recorded refunds from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the final settlement of remaining issues for the 1986 through 1992 tax years. The refund of taxes was $30.4 million, and interest on the refunds was $35.4 million. Overall, including interest and the tax provision thereon, 1999 results increased $36.8 million due to settlements of prior year tax issues.

The Company has adjusted its focus within the Employee Benefits segment to integrated selling that combines long term disability, short term disability, and group life products. During 2001, 28 percent of all new sales included long term disability, short term disability, and group life combined coverage. This compares to 32 percent and 26 percent for 2000 and 1999, respectively. 24 Sales for Employee Benefits, on both a submitted and effective date basis, are as follows: (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2001 % Change 2000 % Change 1999 Sales Submitted Date Basis Group Long term Disability $ 398.4 19.4% $ 333.8 (13.3)% $ 385.2 Group Short term Disability 176.9 19.1 148.5 (13.7) 172.0 Group Life 338.4 12.4 301.0 (1.6) 305.8 Accidental Death & Dismemberment and Group Long term Care 85.8 8.1 79.4 (11.3) 89.5 Total $ 999.5 15.9 $ 862.7 (9.4) $ 952.5 Sales Effective Date Basis Long term Disability $ 356.2 12.0% $ 318.0 (31.9)% $ 466.9 Short term Disability 166.7 32.9 125.4 (38.3) 203.1 Group Life 362.9 63.8 221.5 (34.5) 338.3 Accidental Death & Dismemberment and Group Long term Care 82.1 2.6 80.0 (10.5) 89.4 Total $ 967.9 29.9 $ 744.9 (32.1) $1,097.7 Sales related to employee benefits can fluctuate significantly due to large case size and timing of sales submissions. The Company implemented a number of initiatives throughout 2000 which helped maintain the sales momentum achieved during the last half of 2000 and continuing into 2001, including targeted incentive plans, organizational changes to create a greater focus on the customer, and enhanced communication with producers. In order to give the appropriate focus to the Companys primary business markets, the Company has national practice groups that focus on large employers, executive benefits, and voluntary benefits. These national practice groups partner with the Companys sales force and representatives from claims, customer service, and underwriting to present coverage solutions to potential customers and to manage existing customer accounts. The Company expects that these actions will continue to favorably impact sales growth, but management intends to maintain pricing discipline to balance sales growth and profitability, which may slow the rate of long term sales growth. The Company monitors persistency and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current periods amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Persistency during 2001 for group disability, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment products was generally improved overall from that experienced in 2000 but was unfavorable for certain issue years when compared to the persistency expected at the time the business was written, resulting in additional amortization of $41.5 million. The majority of the unfavorable persistency occurred in more recently issued business, which has higher associated unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs. The additional amortization related to persistency in 2000 and 1999 was $34.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively. It is expected that persistency for the foreseeable future may continue to be lower than historical levels. The Companys 2001 renewal program was generally successful at retaining business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated. It is expected that the additional premium and related profits associated with renewal activity will emerge throughout 2002. The Company intends to maintain a disciplined approach in the re pricing of renewal business, while balancing the need to maximize persistency and retain producer relationships. This approach may lead to lower profit margins on affected cases than originally planned. Revenue from the managed disability line of business, which includes the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries GENEX Services, Inc. and Options and Choices, Inc., totaled $150.6 million in 2001, compared to $126.1 million in 2000 and $107.8 million in 1999. 25 Group Disability Group disability revenue was $3,352.7 million in 2001 compared to $3,200.4 million in 2000. Group disability reported income of $336.9 million for 2001 compared to $211.0 million for 2000. Group disability results for 2001 include $7.3 million for losses related to September 11, 2001, with estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of $9.0 million less an estimated $1.7 million recoverable from the Companys reinsurers. The income for 2000 includes an increase of $65.6 million in group long term disability claim reserves, discussed more fully below. Positive impacts on 2001 income were a $152.3 million revenue increase and a change in the benefit ratio from 87.1 percent in 2000 to 84.1 percent in 2001, excluding losses related to September 11 for 2001 and the $65.6 million reserve increase for 2000. The commission ratio also improved slightly relative to 2000. Negatively impacting income was an increase in the operating expense ratio in 2001 compared to 2000. The 2001 results include $26.3 million of additional amortization necessitated by the higher level of group long term and short term disability terminations experienced during 2001 relative to that which was expected at the time the business was written. The additional amortization during 2000 was $25.8 million. For both 2001 and 2000, the disability business retained is relatively more profitable than the business that terminated. A critical part of the Companys strategy for group disability involves executing its renewal program and managing persistency, both of which management expects will have a positive impact on future premium growth and profitability. The Company has implemented pricing changes in the group disability line wherein prices may increase or decrease by market segment, as appropriate, to respond to current claim experience and other factors and assumptions. Persistency during 2001 on the overall block of group disability improved over 2000, with long term disability persistency at 84.9 percent compared to 81.6 percent last year and short term disability at 82.1 percent versus 80.7 percent in 2000. However, persistency on business sold in 1999 and 2000 has been unfavorable when compared to what was expected when the business was sold, resulting in additional amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs that have a relatively high remaining asset balance. The fundamentals underlying risk results in the group disability line continued to exhibit overall improvement in 2001, as demonstrated by the lower benefit ratio. Claim recovery rates in 2001 continued to be above historical levels but the increase in the claim recovery rates has slowed, as expected, as the Company has now fully implemented the improvements to its claim processes. Both submitted and paid claim incidence for long term disability increased over recent years, with a portion of the increase attributable to industries impacted by the weaker economy. However, in comparing 2001 results with 2000, there was no significant increase in the types of claims normally associated with a weaker economy. For short term disability, both the average claim duration and paid incidence increased from the prior year. The average weekly indemnity continued to increase as well, but the premium per life grew at a slightly higher level. The Company expects to modify its product and pricing strategy in short term disability to be more selective in the product options offered in the large case market, with a focus on self funded or experience rated products. Group disability revenue was $3,200.4 million in 2000 compared to $3,029.0 million in 1999. The high terminations and slow sales decreased the earned premium growth compared to that experienced during 1999 and 1998. Group disability reported income of $211.0 million for 2000 compared to a loss of $225.7 million for 1999. Included in the income for 2000 was an increase of $65.6 million in group long term disability claim reserves, which represented approximately 1.2 percent of total group long term disability claim reserves. The increase, which resulted from lengthening the projected average claim duration for certain of the Companys group long term disability claims, was not a result of deteriorating experience but was believed appropriate based on the Companys assessment of the ultimate settlement of these claims. The 1999 loss of $225.7 million was the result of the $191.7 million charge resulting from lowering the discount rate used to calculate certain of Unums disability claim reserves to conform with Providents process and assumptions and the $359.2 million charge resulting from the revision in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the ultimate cost of unpaid group long term disability claims, as discussed in the preceding "Results of Operations." See Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion. 26 Excluding the adjustments to the disability claim liabilities discussed in the preceding paragraph, the benefit ratio for group disability was 83.5 percent in 1999 compared to 87.1 percent in 2000. For long term disability, the ratio for 2000 was higher than in 1999. The paid claim incidence for long term disability was lower than 1999 due to lower claim acceptance rates, and the rate of net claim resolutions continued to increase during 2000. The 2000 submitted claim incidence rate for long term disability was higher than the rate for 1999. The claims disruption charge taken in the fourth quarter of 1998 resulted in a $50.3 million charge for the group long term disability line of business for the expected increase in claims durations due to managements expectation that productivity in the claims organization would be impacted as a result of planning, consolidation, and integration efforts related to the merger. If the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim durations had not been anticipated at December 31, 1998, the 1999 loss for the group long term disability line of business would have been negatively impacted by $50.3 million. However, the shortfall of the actual 1999 experience below that assumed resulted in a negative effect on 1999 results of $18.1 million. The benefit ratio for short term disability decreased marginally during 2000 from the 1999 ratio. The incidence of submitted claims for short term disability remained relatively constant throughout 2000 and 1999, declining slightly in 2000 compared to the 1999 rate. Negative impacts on the benefit ratio in 2000 were the average claim duration, which increased to its highest level in recent periods during 2000, and an increase in the average weekly indemnity. Additionally, the increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs had a negative impact on 2000 income. This increase resulted from $25.8 million of additional amortization necessitated by the higher level of group long term and short term disability terminations experienced during 2000 relative to that which was expected at the time the business was written. The additional amortization during 1999 was $4.2 million. Also included in 1999 is $3.3 million of amortization related to the write off of the unamortized balance of deferred costs related to certain discontinued products in the foreign operations. Income in 2000 was positively impacted by a 5.7 percent revenue increase and an improvement in both the commission and operating expense ratios relative to 1999. As previously disclosed under "Results of Operations," during 2000 the Company entered into a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance agreement to cede the future claim payments on one of its insurance subsidiaries long duration group long term disability claims which were incurred prior to January 1, 1996. The agreement was effective January 1, 2000. As discussed under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements," certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the Companys business. Components of claims experience, including but not limited to, incidence levels and claims duration, may be worse than expected. Management monitors claims experience in group disability and responds to changes by periodically adjusting prices, refining underwriting guidelines, changing product features, and strengthening risk management policies and procedures. The Company expects to price new business and re price existing business, at contract renewal dates, in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these and other factors, including interest rates, on new claim liabilities. Given the competitive market conditions for the Companys disability products, it is uncertain whether pricing actions can entirely mitigate the effect. The Company, similar to all financial institutions, has some exposure if a severe and prolonged recession occurs, but management believes that the Company is well positioned if a weaker economy were to occur. Many of the Companys products can be re priced, which would allow the Company to reflect in its pricing any fundamental change which might occur in the risk associated with a particular industry or company within an industry. The Company has a well diversified book of insurance exposure, with no disproportionate concentrations of risk in any one industry. Because of improvements made in the claims organization in recent years, the Company believes it can respond to increased levels of submitted claims which might result from a slowing economy. Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Long term Care Group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and long term care reported income of $179.2 million in 2001 compared to $214.0 million in 2000. Included in 2001 income is additional benefit expense of $6.7 million related to the September 11, 2001 tragedy. 27 Group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and long term care reported an increase in revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 due to increases in both premium income and net investment income. Premium growth was attributable to strong sales results in 2001 and improvements in persistency. Persistency for group life was 84.6 percent in 2001, an increase over the 81.5 percent for 2000. For accidental death and dismemberment, persistency was 83.0 percent and 79.5 percent for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Offsetting the 2001 revenue increase was an increase in the benefit ratio and operating expense ratio when compared to the previous year reporting period. The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for 2001 includes $15.2 million of additional amortization due to the higher level of terminations for group life and accidental death and dismemberment products experienced than expected at the time the policies were written. The unfavorable variance of actual to expected terminations occurred primarily in the group life product line. The additional amortization during 2000 was $8.3 million. Group life submitted and paid incidence continued to remain high in 2001, although the incidence rates during the last six months of the year were lower than the rates for the first half of 2001. The average paid claim size has also increased compared to the prior year, and waiver incidence continues to be above recent levels. The claim recovery rate on waiver claims has increased, somewhat mitigating the impact of the increase in waiver incidence. Group life 2001 benefits include estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of $17.0 million less an estimated $14.0 million recoverable from the Companys reinsurers, for a net increase in benefits of $3.0 million related to the September 11, 2001 tragedy. The Company has implemented several actions in the group life line of business, including tighter underwriting guidelines and pricing changes, and is developing case specific remedial plans for under performing business. The Company believes these actions will improve profitability in group life, but it is uncertain whether these actions will restore the profitability that this line of business has historically reported. As a result of the actions implemented, it is expected that the sales growth rate in this business will slow from that experienced in recent years. This was evidenced by the rate of growth reported for group life sales in the fourth quarter of 2001, with a 15.2 percent and 27.0 percent decline, compared to the fourth quarter of 2000, reported for submitted and effective date basis sales, respectively. The 2001 benefit ratio for accidental death and dismemberment was higher than 2000 primarily due to a significant increase in the average paid claim amounts. The rate of claim incidence in 2001 did not change significantly over the prior year. The 2001 results for accidental death and dismemberment include estimated gross ultimate losses of $25.0 million less estimated reinsurance recoverables of $21.3 million, for a net increase in benefits of $3.7 million related to the September 11, 2001 tragedy. These losses relate to both accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident coverages. Group long term care reported a very slight decrease in the benefit ratio for 2001 compared to 2000, although the last two quarters of 2001 reported increasing benefit ratios relative to the first half of the year and to prior year quarters. The reinsurance transaction entered into during 2000 under which an insurance subsidiary of the Company cedes through a net quota share reinsurance agreement 50 percent of the group life volume above the aggregate retention limit does not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and is therefore accounted for as a deposit. As such, there is no effect on reported premium income or benefits. The only impact on the income statement is the risk charge paid to the reinsurers. See Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of the reinsurance transactions. Group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and long term care reported income of $214.0 million in 2000 compared to $239.5 million in 1999. Group life and long term care both reported an increase in revenue for 2000 compared to 1999 due to increases in premium income and net investment income. Offsetting the revenue increase was an increase in the benefit ratio when compared to 1999. Group life reported a higher benefit ratio in 2000 compared to the prior year due to an increase in the average paid claim size and waiver incidence, partially offset by a decrease in paid mortality incidence. 28 The 2000 benefit ratio for accidental death and dismemberment was higher than 1999 due to an increase in the average paid claim size. Submitted incidence for accidental death and dismemberment improved relative to 1999. Group long term care reported a higher benefit ratio for 2000 compared to 1999. The long term care net claim resolution rate for 2000 is below the average rate for 1999, primarily due to a decrease in claim recoveries. The 2000 incidence rates for both submitted and paid claims improved over the prior year. The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for 2000 includes $8.3 million of additional amortization due to the higher level of terminations for group life and accidental death and dismemberment products experienced during 2000 relative to that which was expected at the time the policies were written. Positively impacting 2000 income was an improvement in the commission and operating expense ratios.

Individual Disability New annualized sales in the individual disability line of business were $145.1 million in 2001, compared to $116.1 million in 2000 and $124.1 million in 1999. The Company developed a new individual disability product portfolio that was released for sale in approved states early in the fourth quarter of 2000. The new portfolio utilizes a modular approach offering customers a range of product options and features. This portfolio was designed to combine the best features from prior Company offerings and includes return to work incentives and optional long term care conversion benefits and or benefits for catastrophic disabilities. Management expects that premium income in the individual disability line will grow on a year over year basis as the portfolio transition produces increasing levels of new sales of individual disability products and as a result of an increased focus on integrated disability sales in group and individual, as well as other sales initiatives discussed under "Employee Benefits Segment Operating Results." The persistency of individual disability business continues to be stable. 29 Revenue was $2,615.8 million for 2001 compared to $2,585.6 million in 2000. Income in the individual disability line of business was $274.8 million in 2001, a decrease of 3.7 percent over the prior year. Included in the results for 2001 was $14.0 million of estimated gross ultimate losses related to September 11, 2001, less an estimated recoverable from reinsurers of $4.0 million. Excluding this $10.0 million loss, income would have been essentially level with 2000. The benefit ratio of 107.7 percent for 2001 was slightly higher than the 2000 ratio of 106.6 percent. The interest adjusted loss ratio was 63.6 percent and 63.4 percent for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Submitted and paid claim incidence rates for the overall individual disability line of business increased from 2000 and are higher than recent historical incidence rates. The claim recovery rate for 2001 increased compared to the 2000 results. Individual disability also benefited from a slightly improved commission ratio for 2001 as compared to 2000, but the operating expense ratio increased. The overall individual disability results for 2001 were negatively impacted by the business issued during the mid 1990s and prior years. The interest adjusted loss ratios for later issue years are significantly below the overall ratio of 63.6 percent, even in the more poorly performing market segments and product lines. The improvement in the later issue year business reflects the substantial product, distribution, and underwriting changes made during that time period. The Company is reviewing internal and external alternatives, including reinsurance, for improving the overall results in its individual disability line of business, particularly as related to business issued prior to the mid 1990s. Revenue was $2,585.6 million in 2000 compared to $2,371.9 million in 1999. The growth in 2000 revenue was driven primarily by the growth in premium income as well as net investment income and other income. Premium income in 2000 included $96.6 million from an inforce block of individual disability business reinsured effective January 1, 2000. Other income benefited from the income on assets held in trust under this reinsurance arrangement. Net investment income for individual disability increased due to the increase in the level of invested assets allocated to this line of business. Income in the individual disability line of business was $285.3 million in 2000, an increase of $28.6 million from the prior year. As discussed in the preceding "Results of Operations," in the second quarter of 1999 the Company lowered the discount rate used to calculate certain of Unums disability claim reserves to conform with Providents process and assumptions, which decreased individual disability income by $38.9 million in 1999. Excluding this 1999 adjustment, individual disability income decreased $10.3 million in 2000 compared to 1999. See Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion. This line reported an increase in the benefit ratio for 2000 compared to last years ratio, excluding the 1999 discount rate change. Submitted incidence for 2000 was slightly higher than the average for the year 1999, while paid incidence improved relative to the prior year. The claim acceptance rate declined throughout 1999 and 2000, and the net claim resolution rate for 2000 increased from 1999. Offsetting these trends was an increase in reserves for existing claims. Individual disability benefited from improved commission and operating expense ratios for 2000 as compared to 1999. The amortization of value of business acquired increased in 2000 primarily as a result of the amortization on the block of inforce business reinsured effective January 1, 2000. As noted in the "Employee Benefits Segment Operating Results," claim resolution rate assumptions were revised downward in the fourth quarter of 1998 for claim operations integration activities related to the merger. The Company recorded a $100.3 million charge in the fourth quarter of 1998 in the Individual segment related to the revised claim resolution rates for individual disability. If the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim durations had not been anticipated at December 31, 1998, income for the individual disability line of business would have been negatively impacted by $100.3 million in 1999. In addition, the excess of the actual 1999 experience over that assumed resulted in a positive effect on income of $25.6 million. Individual Long term Care The individual long term care line of business reported a 35 percent increase in premium income for 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to new sales growth. New annualized sales for long term care were $53.8 million for 2001, $47.7 million for 2000, and $40.0 million for 1999. The Company expects the strong sales momentum in individual long term care to continue. Net investment income continues to increase due to the growth in this line of business. 30 Income in the individual long term care line of business was $15.9 million in 2001 compared to $12.8 million for 2000, primarily due to an increase in revenue and an improvement in the commission and operating expense ratios. The benefit ratio increased when compared to 2000. The increase over the prior year resulted primarily from an increase in the active life reserve. Paid incidence was essentially unchanged from 2000, and the claim recovery rate increased. The individual long term care line of business reported increased premium income for both 2000 and 1999 as compared to the previous years, primarily due to continued new sales growth. Income for 2000 was $12.8 million, compared to a loss of $2.6 million in 1999. The increase in revenue, as well as improvements in both the benefit ratio and operating expense ratios, contributed to the year over year increase.

These products include life insurance and health products, primarily disability, accident and sickness, and cancer. Revenue in the Voluntary Benefits segment increased to $928.8 million in 2001 from $859.3 million in 2000 primarily due to the increase in premium income which was attributable to sales growth and favorable persistency. New annualized sales for 2001 were $296.6 million, an increase of 11.9 percent over the prior year. Management continues its efforts to increase sales through the sales initiatives discussed under "Employee Benefits Segment Operating Results." For 2001, all of the product lines reported an increase in premium income and net investment income over 2000. The life and disability product lines both reported a marginal increase in the benefit ratio relative to 2000. The increase for life was due primarily to an increase in the size of the average paid claim. Claim payments for disability increased due to an increase in the average monthly indemnity and a lengthening of the duration of claims, but the incidence rates remained stable. The benefit ratio for the other line was higher in 2001 compared to 2000 due partially to the poor results from the block of business which was reinsured in the fourth quarter of 2001 and also due to an increase in the average claim size for the Companys other cancer products. 31 As previously discussed, during 2001 the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis certain cancer policies written by the Companys subsidiary, Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company. The transaction closed during the fourth quarter with an effective date of November 1, 2001. The Company ceded approximately $113.6 million of reserves to the reinsurer. The $12.3 million before tax gain on this transaction was deferred and is being amortized into income based upon expected future premium income on the policies ceded. The Company will continue to market its other cancer products. Revenue in the Voluntary Benefits segment increased to $859.3 million in 2000 from $804.5 million in 1999. Sales growth and continued favorable persistency were the primary factors contributing to the increase in premium income. New annualized sales in this segment were $265.0 million in 2000 and $245.3 million in 1999. The investment income growth in 2000 as compared to 1999 was due to the repositioning of the investment portfolio subsequent to the merger. Income for 2000 increased 12.4 percent over 1999, primarily due to revenue growth of $54.8 million. An additional positive impact on 2000 income was a favorable operating expense ratio attributable to costs savings resulting from the merger. The 2000 benefit ratio was higher than the ratio reported in 1999. The primary drivers were an increase in benefits in the life product line and an increase in the incurred and paid loss ratios for the cancer product line.

It is expected that revenue and income in this segment will decline over time as these business lines wind down. Management expects to reinvest the capital supporting these lines of business in the future growth of the Employee Benefits, Individual, and Voluntary Benefits segments. The closed blocks of business have been segregated for reporting and monitoring purposes. 32 Individual Life and Corporate Owned Life As previously discussed, during 2000 the Company reinsured substantially all of the individual life and corporate owned life insurance blocks of business. The Company ceded approximately $3.3 billion of reserves to the reinsurer. The $388.2 million before tax gain on these transactions was deferred and is being amortized into income based upon expected future premium income on the traditional insurance policies ceded and estimated future gross profits on the interest sensitive insurance policies ceded. The unamortized balance of the deferred gain was $343.9 million at the end of 2001 and $373.5 million at the end of 2000. The Company recognized a 2000 before tax realized investment loss of $25.9 million on the fixed maturity securities transferred to the reinsurer. In connection with this realized loss, the Company retrospectively adjusted deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired related to interest sensitive individual life policies with credits to current period amortization of $9.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, to reflect investment experience. See "Investments" for further discussion of the realized investment loss. Total revenue for individual life and corporate owned life insurance was $42.7 million, $236.1 million, and $435.0 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Income for the same periods was $38.9 million, $49.6 million, and $65.6 million. Reinsurance Pools and Management The Companys reinsurance operations include the reinsurance management operations of Duncanson & Holt, Inc. (D&H) and the risk assumption, which includes reinsurance pool participation; direct reinsurance which includes accident and health (A&H), long term care (LTC), and long term disability coverages; and Lloyds of London (Lloyds) syndicate participations. During 1999, the Company concluded that these operations were not solidly aligned with the Companys strength in the disability insurance market and decided to exit these operations through a combination of a sale, reinsurance, and or placing certain components in run off. In 1999, the Company sold the reinsurance management operations of its A&H and LTC reinsurance facilities and reinsured the Companys risk participation in these facilities. The Company also decided to discontinue its London accident reinsurance pool participation beginning in year 2000. With respect to Lloyds, the Company implemented a strategy which limited participation in year 2000 underwriting risks, ceased participation in Lloyds underwriting risks after year 2000, and managed the run off of its risk participation in open years of account of Lloyds reinsurance syndicates. During 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to limit its liabilities pertaining to the Lloyds syndicate participations. Separately, the Company also reinsured 100 percent of the group disability reinsurance reserves and all future business underwritten and managed by Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc., a subsidiary of D&H. The transaction, in which reserves of approximately $323.8 million were ceded to the reinsurer, had an effective date of January 1, 2001. In a separate but related transaction, the Company also sold the reinsurance management operations of Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc. and divested the remaining assets of that facility during 2001. See Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of the reinsurance operations. During 2001, the reinsurance pools and management operations reported a gain of $0.1 million compared to losses of $32.7 million in 2000 and $279.7 million in 1999. Included in the 2000 results were $37.4 million of charges related to the Companys London accident reinsurance pool participation. During 1999, the Company recorded charges of $270.1 million resulting from its decision to exit these pools, but at that time there was insufficient information to fully evaluate all of the exposures. During 2000, additional changes to fund these exposures and provide for the run off of its participation resulted in a claim reserve adjustment of $21.9 million and uncollectible receivables and loss provisions of $15.5 million. In 1999, an additional $57.7 million was recorded in the Corporate segment related to the write off of goodwill. See "Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7 and Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 for further discussion of the 1999 and 2000 charges related to the reinsurance operations. Also, as previously discussed in the preceding "Results of Operations," during 1999 the Company lowered the discount rate used to calculate certain of Unums disability claim reserves to conform with Providents process and assumptions, which decreased the group long term disability reinsurance income reported in this line of business by $10.1 million in 1999. 33 In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a $2.4 million charge related to the revised claim resolution rates for group long term disability reinsurance. If the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim duration had not been anticipated at December 31, 1998, 1999 income for the reinsurance pools and management line of business would have been negatively impacted by $2.4 million. Other Group pension, health insurance, individual annuities, and other closed lines of business had revenue of $201.3 million, $219.4 million, and $279.1 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999 and income of $14.3 million, $26.4 million, and $35.6 million. Decreases in revenue and income are expected to continue as these lines of business wind down. Included in these amounts are the Companys operating results for its operations in Argentina, which produced revenue of $47.1 million, $40.2 million, and $32.9 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999 and income (losses) of $1.1 million, $2.7 million, and $(0.8) million in each of those three years. As previously mentioned, the Company in 2001 wrote off the remaining goodwill balance of $5.4 million related to its operations in Argentina. The goodwill write off is included in the Corporate segment operating results. The net assets related to the Argentina operations were approximately $9.2 million at December 31, 2001. Corporate Segment Operating Results The Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, amortization of goodwill, and certain corporate expenses not allocated to a line of business. Revenue in the Corporate segment was $44.6 million in 2001, $48.1 million in 2000, and $67.7 million in 1999. As previously discussed under "Results of Operations," during 1999 the Company recorded refunds from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the final settlement of remaining issues for the 1986 through 1992 tax years. The interest on the refunds was $35.4 million and is included in 1999 revenue. The Corporate segment reported losses of $169.2 million in 2001, $49.5 million in 2000, and $484.6 million in 1999. Interest and debt expense was $169.6 million in 2001, $181.8 million in 2000, and $137.8 million in 1999. The amortization of goodwill was $26.6 million in 2001, $22.3 million in 2000, and $82.6 million in 1999. The Company recorded write downs of goodwill of $5.4 million in 2001 related to its Argentina operations and $57.7 million during 1999 related to its reinsurance operations. See previous discussion under "Other Segment Operating Results" and Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion. Results for 2000 were positively impacted by the gain of $116.1 million on the pension plan transaction, partially offset by consolidation and benefit accruals of $9.4 million. See previous discussion contained herein in "Results of Operations" and Note 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." As previously discussed, during 1999 the Company recognized $310.6 million of before tax expenses related to the merger and the early retirement offer to employees. These expenses are as follows (in millions of dollars): Employee related expense $ 77.7 Exit activities related to duplicate facilities/asset abandonments 67.4 Investment banking, legal, and accounting fees 39.6 Subtotal 184.7 Expense related to the early retirement offer to employees 125.9 Subtotal 310.6 Income tax benefit 89.2 Total $221.4 Employee related expense consists of employee severance costs, change in control costs, restricted stock costs which fully vested upon stockholder adoption of the merger agreement or upon completion of the merger, and outplacement costs to assist employees who are involuntarily terminated. Severance benefits and change in control costs were $60.2 million, and costs associated with the vesting of restricted stock were $17.5 million. 34 Exit activities related to duplicate facilities/asset abandonments consist of closing of duplicate offices and write off of redundant computer hardware and software. The cost associated with these office closures was approximately $25.6 million, which represents the cost of future minimum lease payments less any estimated amounts recovered under subleases. Also, certain physical assets, primarily computer equipment, redundant systems, and systems incapable of supporting the combined entity, were abandoned as a result of the merger, resulting in a write down of the assets book values by approximately $41.8 million. The exit plan was complete as of June 30, 2000. In addition to the expenses described above, in 1999 the Company expensed $24.7 million of other incremental costs associated with the merger, $21.8 million of which are included in the Corporate segment. These expenses consist primarily of compensation, training, integration, and licensing costs. Investments Investment activities are an integral part of the Companys business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results. Invested assets are segmented into portfolios, which support the various product lines. Generally, the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations and to maximize investment returns, subject to constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations. See Notes 4 and 5 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of the Companys investments and derivative financial instruments. Excluding the net investment income reported in the Other segment, which continues its expected decline as these product lines are sold, reinsured, or wind down, 2001 net investment income increased 8.1 percent over the previous year. The overall yield in the portfolio remains relatively stable at 8.02 percent as of the end of 2001 compared to 8.06 percent at the end of 2000. The Company is actively marketing its real estate investments and presently evaluating the possible sale of all or a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio for replacement with longer duration securities. The Company reported a before tax net realized investment loss of $40.6 million in 2001. The loss was the net of gains of $150.6 million and losses of $191.2 million, including write downs of $153.8 million recognized as a result of managements determination that the value of certain fixed maturity securities had other than temporarily declined. During 2000, the Company reported a net realized investment loss before tax of $14.6 million, including the realized investment loss of $25.9 million on the investment grade fixed maturity securities transferred to the reinsurer in connection with the individual life and corporate owned life reinsurance transactions. The loss on these transferred securities was driven by a change in market interest rates and was not attributable to any credit deterioration. Excluding the reinsurance transaction related loss, the Company reported a net gain of $51.0 million in 2000 from the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities. Offsetting this gain was a $94.0 million realized investment loss recognized because the value of certain fixed maturity securities had other than temporarily declined. The following table provides the distribution of invested assets for the years indicated. Policy loans are reported on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition and in the table below. Policy loans of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion were ceded as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and the investment income thereon is no longer included in income. December 31 2001 2000 Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 78.1% 78.3% Below Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities 8.0 6.6 Equity Securities 0.1 0.1 Mortgage Loans 3.3 4.3 Real Estate 0.2 0.4 Policy Loans 8.9 9.1 Other Invested Assets 1.4 1.2 Total 100.0% 100.0% 35 Fixed Maturity Securities The Companys investment in mortgage backed securities was approximately $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion on an amortized cost basis at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2001, the mortgage backed securities had an average life of 9.5 years and effective duration of 8.5 years. The mortgage backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities. The primary risk involved in investing in mortgage backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal. The Company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates. The Company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives, such as interest only, principal only or residuals, where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates. The Companys exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2001, was $2,261.7 million, representing 8.7 percent of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans, below the Companys internal limit of 10.0 percent of invested assets for this type of investment. The Companys exposure to below investment grade fixed maturities totaled $1,760.8 million at December 31, 2000, representing 7.2 percent of invested assets. The year over year increase resulted from downgrades of existing securities that were previously investment grade rather than the purchase of additional below investment grade securities. Below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher. Also, the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid. The Company expects additional downgrades to occur during 2002, with resulting realized investment losses. The Company does not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by the investments in below investment grade securities, nor does it expect these investments to adversely affect its ability to hold its other investments to maturity. The Company has investments in four special purpose entities whose purposes are to support the Companys investment objectives. These entities are for asset collateralization and contain specific investment securities that do not include the Companys common stock or debt. These investments are described as follows: During 2001, the Company invested in two special purpose entity trusts that have underlying assets consisting of unrelated equity securities. The investments in these trusts qualify as fixed maturity securities under generally accepted accounting principles and were reported at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition contained herein in Item 8. The fair value of these investments was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets based on quoted market prices. The fair value and amortized cost of these investments were $50.5 million and $58.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The Company has an investment in a collateralized bond obligation asset trust in which it is also the investment manager of the underlying high yield securities. This investment was reported at fair value with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of this investment was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets based on quoted market prices. The fair value and amortized cost of this investment was $20.4 million and $46.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $29.4 million and $51.9 million at December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001, the Company had a retained interest in a special purpose entity trust that was securitized with financial assets consisting of a United States Treasury bond and several limited partnership equity interests. This investment was reported at fair value and included with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of this investment was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets, which are based on quoted market prices as well as the limited partnership capital balances. The fair value and amortized cost of this investment was $113.6 million and $122.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001 and $121.8 million and $114.5 million at December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001, the Company had capital commitments of $21.7 million to this special purpose entity trust. These funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from the trust. These amounts may or may not be funded during the term of the trust. 36 Mortgage Loans and Real Estate The Companys mortgage loan portfolio was $941.2 million and $1,135.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types. The incidence of new problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity remains low, and management expects the level of delinquencies and problem loans to remain low in the future. No new mortgage loans were added to the Companys investment portfolio during 2001 and 2000 other than two purchase money mortgages associated with the sale of real estate. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, impaired loans totaled $13.1 million and $17.7 million, respectively. Included in the impaired mortgage loans at December 31, 2001 were $6.4 million of loans which had a related, specific investment valuation allowance of $2.4 million and $6.7 million of loans which had no related, specific allowance. Impaired mortgage loans are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. Restructured mortgage loans totaled $5.7 million and $8.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and represent loans that have been refinanced with terms more favorable to the borrower. Interest lost on restructured loans was immaterial for 2001 and 2000. Real estate was $51.8 million and $116.7 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999. Investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets the Companys investment criteria. If investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value. Occasionally, investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets the Companys investment criteria. Real estate held for sale, which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell, amounted to $7.6 million at December 31, 2001, and $18.3 million at December 31, 2000. The Company uses a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each mortgage loan and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation. The Company establishes an investment valuation allowance for mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio, considering the value of the underlying collateral. Investment valuation allowances for real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets. If a decline in value of a mortgage loan or real estate investment is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired, the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value, and the reduction is recognized as a realized investment loss. Management monitors the risk associated with these invested asset portfolios and regularly reviews and adjusts the investment valuation allowance. As a result of managements most recent review of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and based on managements expectation that delinquencies and problem loans will remain low, the valuation allowance on mortgage loans was reduced $10.5 million during 2001. The real estate valuation allowance was reduced $5.7 million during 2001 in conjunction with the sale of the associated property. At December 31, 2001, the balance in the valuation allowance for mortgage loans and real estate was $2.4 million and $19.9 million, respectively. Other The Companys exposure to non current investments totaled $176.7 million at December 31, 2001, or 0.7 percent of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans. These non current investments are foreclosed real estate held for sale and fixed income securities and mortgage loans that became more than thirty days past due in principal and interest payments. The Company has an investment program wherein it simultaneously enters into repurchase transactions and reverse repurchase transactions with the same party. The Company nets the related receivables and payables in the consolidated statements of financial condition as these transactions are with the same party and include a right of offset. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $391.7 million face value of these contracts in an open position that were offset. 37 Historically, the Company has utilized interest rate futures contracts, current and forward interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, and options on forward interest rate swaps, forward treasuries, or specific fixed income securities to manage duration and increase yield on cash flows expected from current holdings and future premium income. Positions under the Companys hedging programs for derivative activity that were open during 2001 involved current and forward interest rate swaps, as well as currency swaps which are used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency denominated fixed income securities. All transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative. Almost all transactions are associated with the individual and group long term care and the individual and group disability product portfolios. All other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in its insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash. Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions), and operating expenses as well as purchases of new investments. The Company has established an investment strategy that management believes will provide for adequate cash flows from operations. Cash flows from operations were $1,770.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $1,211.5 million and $1,566.7 million for the comparable periods of 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company believes the cash flows from its operations will be sufficient to meet its operating and financial cash flow requirements, excluding the strain placed on capital as a result of the charges recorded in connection with the merger. As a result of the effect on capital during 1999 of the merger related charges, the Company raised approximately $500 million through the debt markets during the fourth quarter of 1999 by securing $200 million of one year bank debt and by issuing commercial paper. The Companys source of cash could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for the Companys insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims. The Companys policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and the Company therefore has minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities. Cash flow could also be negatively impacted by a deterioration in the credit market whereby the Companys ability to liquidate its positions in certain of its fixed maturity securities would be impacted such that the Company might not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner. The Company is dependent upon payments from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its stockholders and to pay its expenses. These payments by the Companys insurance and non insurance subsidiaries may take the form of interest payments on amounts loaned to such subsidiaries by the Company, operating and investment management fees, and or dividends. At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding from its insurance subsidiaries a $150.0 million surplus debenture due in 2006 with a weighted average interest rate during 2001 of 7.85 percent and a $100.0 million surplus debenture due in 2027 with a weighted average interest rate during 2001 of 8.25 percent. Semi annual interest payments are conditional upon the approval by the insurance department of the state of domicile. Restrictions under applicable insurance laws limit the amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities. Generally, for life insurance subsidiaries domiciled or commercially domiciled in the United States, that limitation equals the greater of ten percent of an insurers statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year. Further, pursuant to the 1999 merger of Unum and Provident, the Company is required to obtain approval from the Maine Bureau of Insurance (Maine Bureau) regarding payment of ordinary dividends from the Companys Maine domiciled insurance subsidiary until 2004. The payment of ordinary dividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries is further limited to the amount of statutory surplus as it relates to policyholders. Based on the restrictions under current law, during 2002 $384.9 million is available for the payment of ordinary dividends to the Company from its domestic insurance subsidiaries. Of this amount, $121.8 million is conditional upon approval from the Maine Bureau. 38 The Company also has the ability to draw a dividend from its United Kingdom based affiliate, Unum Limited. Such dividends are limited in amount, based on insurance company law in the United Kingdom, which requires a minimum solvency margin. Approximately $27.5 million will be available for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2002. The amount available during 2001 for the payment of ordinary dividends from the Companys domestic insurance subsidiaries was $359.9 million, including $149.2 million available with approval from the Maine Bureau. Of the total available, $148.6 million was utilized, including $50.0 million as requested by the Company and approved by the Maine Bureau. The amount available during 2001 from Unum Limited was $20.9 million, none of which was utilized. The ability of the Company to continue to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval will be dependent upon the level of earnings of its insurance subsidiaries as calculated under law. In addition to regulatory restrictions, the amount of dividends that will be paid by insurance subsidiaries will depend on additional factors, such as risk based capital ratios, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support the ratings desired by the Company. Regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution to the Company from its non insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2001, the Company had short term and long term debt totaling $161.8 million and $2,004.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2001, approximately $403.0 million was available for additional financing under the Companys revolving credit facilities. The debt to total capital ratio was 29.8 percent at December 31, 2001 compared to 30.2 percent at December 31, 2000. Contingent upon market conditions and corporate needs, management may refinance short term notes payable with longer term securities. During 2001 the Company redeemed its $172.5 million par value 8.8% monthly income debt securities (junior subordinated debt), which were due in 2025 but callable at par in 2000 and thereafter. This early redemption is expected to lower the Companys financing costs in 2002 through the use of commercial paper available at lower interest rates. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a write off of the remaining deferred debt cost of $4.5 million associated with the issuance of the securities. The extraordinary loss, net of a $1.6 million tax benefit, was $2.9 million. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company entered into $1.0 billion senior revolving credit facilities with a group of banks. The facilities, which are split into five year revolver and 364 day portions, replaced a 364 day revolver which expired in October 2000 and a five year revolver which has been canceled. The new facilities are available for general corporate purposes, including support of the Companys $1.0 billion commercial paper program, and contain certain covenants that, among other provisions, include a minimum tangible net worth requirement, a maximum leverage ratio restriction, and a limitation on debt relative to the consolidated statutory earnings of the Companys insurance subsidiaries. The 364 day portion of the credit facilities was renewed as of October 30, 2001. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration on Form S 3 covering the issuance of up to $1.0 billion of securities in order to provide funding alternatives for its maturing debt. The shelf registration became effective in September 2000. In March 2001, the Company completed a long term debt offering, issuing $575.0 million of 7.625% senior notes due March 1, 2011. Contingent upon market conditions and corporate needs, remaining funding under the shelf registration will be used to refinance debt on a longer term basis and or to fund other corporate needs. During the second quarter of 2000, the Company issued $200.0 million of variable rate notes in a privately negotiated transaction. The notes were used to refinance other short term debt and had a weighted average interest rate of 7.52 percent during the first quarter of 2001. The notes matured in April 2001. 39 In 1998, the Company completed a public offering of $200.0 million of 7.25% senior notes due March 15, 2028. In 1998, Provident Financing Trust I, a wholly owned subsidiary trust of the Company, issued $300.0 million of 7.405% capital securities in a public offering. These capital securities, which mature on March 15, 2038, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, have a liquidation value of $1,000 per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances. The Company issued $300.0 million of 7.405% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, which mature on March 15, 2038, to the subsidiary trust in connection with the capital securities offering. The sole assets of the subsidiary trust are the junior subordinated debt securities. In 1998, the Company completed a public offering of $200.0 million of 6.375% senior notes due July 15, 2005, and $200.0 million of 7.0% senior notes due July 15, 2018. In December 1998, the Company issued $250.0 million of 6.75% senior notes, which mature in 2028. Contractual debt and Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities commitments are as follows (in millions of dollars): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 4 to 5 After Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Short term Debt $ 161.8 $ 161.8 $ $ $ Long term Debt 2,004.2 470.2 247.0 1,287.0 Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities 300.0 300.0 Total $2,466.0 $ 632.0 $ 247.0 $ $1,587.0 Commercial paper debt of $470.2 million was classified as long term at December 31, 2001 because the Company has the ability through the senior revolving credit facilities to convert this obligation into long term debt. The Company intends to refinance the commercial paper either by issuing additional commercial paper or by replacing commercial paper debt with long term debt issued under the current shelf registration statement. The Company has an agreement with an outside party wherein the Company is provided computer data processing services and related functions. The contract expires in 2010, but the Company may cancel this agreement effective August 2005 or later upon payment of applicable cancellation charges. The aggregate noncancelable contractual obligation remaining under this agreement is $258.8 million at December 31, 2001, with no annual payment expected to exceed $69.9 million. As previously discussed, at December 31, 2001, the Company had capital commitments of $21.7 million to fund a special purpose entity trust in which the Company has a retained interest. The Company also has capital commitments of $36.6 million to fund certain of its private placement fixed maturity securities. The funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from the issuer. These amounts may or may not be funded during the term of the security. 40 Ratings Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P), Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), Fitch, Inc. (Fitch), and A.M. Best Company (AM Best) are among the third parties that provide the Company assessments of its overall financial position. Ratings from these agencies for financial strength are available for the individual U.S. domiciled insurance company subsidiaries. Financial strength ratings are based primarily on U.S. statutory financial information for the individual U.S. domiciled insurance companies. Debt ratings for the Company are based primarily on consolidated financial information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles. Both financial strength ratings and debt ratings incorporate qualitative analyses by rating agencies on an ongoing basis. If the Company were to experience negative operating trends, it could result in a downgrade of the current ratings, which might impact the Companys ability to sell and retain its business. The table below reflects the current debt ratings for the Company and the financial strength ratings for the U.S. domiciled insurance company subsidiaries.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The following discussion regarding the Companys risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur (sensitivity analysis). Caution should be used in evaluating the Companys overall market risk from the information presented below, as actual results may differ. The Company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks. See Notes 4 and 5 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk, including derivative financial instrument activity. Interest Rate Risk The operations of the Company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations, primarily long term U.S. interest rates. Changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows. Management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes. This analysis is the precursor to the Companys activities in derivative financial instruments. The Company uses interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, exchange traded interest rate futures contracts, and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities. Assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels, the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be $0.8 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The fair values of mortgage loans, which are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost, would decrease by approximately $50 million and $70 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Held to maturity securities are also reported at amortized cost and would decrease by approximately $40 million at December 31, 2000. There were no held to maturity securities at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, assuming a 100 basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels, the fair values of the Companys long term debt would increase approximately $125 million and $100 million, respectively, and the fair values of the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities would increase approximately $40 million and $30 million, respectively. The effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a matrix pricing system whereby all securities were priced with the resulting market rates and spreads assuming a change of 100 basis points. These hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value. The changes in the fair values of long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were determined using discounted cash flows analyses. Because the Company actively manages its investments and liabilities, actual changes could be less than those estimated above. Foreign Currency Risk The Company is also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its foreign operations and certain investment securities dominated in those local currencies. Foreign operations represented 7.4 percent and 7.7 percent of total assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and 8.7 percent and 9.7 percent of total revenue for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Assuming foreign exchange rates decreased 10 percent from the December 31, 2001 and 2000 levels, year end 2001 and 2000 stockholders equity would not be materially affected. 42
