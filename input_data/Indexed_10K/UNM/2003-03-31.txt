ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction The following discusses the Companys restatement of financial information, critical accounting policies and reviews the results of segment operating results, consolidated investments, the Companys liquidity and capital resources, and current debt and financial strength ratings of the Company and its insurance subsidiaries. Restatement of Financial Information During 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments on certain of its fixed maturity securities based on values that included their quoted market prices, as well as to give effect to analysis by the Company with respect to certain issuers of securities that perhaps was not reflected in those market prices. After discussions with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Division of Corporation Finance, the Company has concluded that not relying solely on quoted market prices for its other than temporary impairment charges was an erroneous interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and, accordingly, is restating its previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 to adjust the amounts recorded during 2001 and 2000 on these securities such that the other than temporary impairments are based on the then quoted market prices. The non cash adjustments did not impact the Companys total stockholders equity in any period because the Company had already recorded the unrealized effect of the decreased market value of its fixed maturity securities through stockholders equity in the appropriate periods. The effect of these restatements increased net income $34.2 million in 2002 and decreased net income $38.0 million and $25.3 million in 2001 and 2000. Additional detail is presented below and in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein in Item 8.

Policy reserves equal the present value of the difference between future policy benefits and expenses and future premiums, allowing a margin for profit. These reserves are applicable for the majority of the Companys business, which is traditional non interest sensitive in nature. The claim payments are estimated using assumptions established when the policy was issued. Ordinarily, generally accepted accounting principles require that these assumptions not be subsequently modified unless the policy reserves are determined to be inadequate. Throughout the life of the policy, the reserve is based on the original assumptions used for the policys issue year. A claim reserve is established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. Policy reserves for a particular policy continue to be maintained after a claim reserve has been established for as long as the policy remains in force. Claim reserves generally equal the Companys estimate, at the current reporting period, of the present value of the liability for future benefits and expenses to be paid on a claim. A claim reserve for a specific claim is based on assumptions derived from the Companys actual historical experience as to claim duration as well as the specific characteristics of the claimant such as benefits available under the policy, the covered benefit period, and the age and occupation of the claimant. Consideration is given to historical trends in the Companys experience and to expected deviations from historical experience that result from changes in benefits available, changes in the Companys risk management policies and procedures, and other economic, environmental, or societal factors. Reserves for claims that are estimated to have already been incurred but that have not yet been reported to the Company are based on factors such as historical claim reporting patterns, the average cost of claims, and the expected volumes of incurred claims. Claim reserves, unlike policy reserves, are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change. In a reporting period, actual experience may deviate from the long term assumptions used to determine the claim reserves. The Company reviews annually, or more frequently as appropriate, emerging experience to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses. This review includes the determination of a range of reasonable estimates within which the reserve must fall. The Companys reserves for group and individual disability products include a provision for future payments other than legal expenses on all lawsuits for which the cause of action has already occurred. This includes known lawsuits and those yet to be filed. The reserve amount is the Companys estimate of the payments on all such lawsuits based on past payments and expected future payments. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs The Company defers certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortizes (expenses) these costs over the life of the related policies.Deferred costs include commissions, other agency compensation, certain selection and policy issue expenses, and certain field expenses. Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral. The Company uses its own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of its business in determining the expected life of the policies. Approximately 93 percent of the Companys deferred policy acquisition costs relate to traditional non interest sensitive products, for which the costs are amortized in proportion to the estimated premium income to be received over the life of the policies. The estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years, which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy. Amortization of deferred costs on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience. The Company will experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected. Deferred costs related to group and individual disability products are amortized over a twenty year period. For costs deferred in 2002, approximately 75 percent and 90 percent of the original deferred costs related to group disability products are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen, respectively. For individual disability policies, approximately 45 percent and 75 percent of the original deferred costs are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen, respectively. Deferred costs for group life products are amortized over a fifteen year period, with approximately 85 percent of the cost expected to be amortized by year ten. Deferred costs for group and individual long term care 21 Table of Contents products are amortized over a twenty year period, with approximately 60 percent and 80 percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen, respectively. For costs deferred in 2002, the period of amortization has not changed from the period used for costs deferred in previous years, but the expected proportion of costs amortized in the early years of the life of the policy has been accelerated due to recent Company experience relative to persistency. Valuation of Fixed Maturity Securities In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, the Company evaluates the following factors: The significance of the decline in value. The time period during which there has been a significant decline in value. Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments. The probability of recovering principal and interest. The Companys ability and intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover. Market conditions. Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles. Rating agency actions. Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity. Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings. Any other key measures for the related security. The Companys review procedures include, but are not limited to, biweekly meetings of certain members of the Companys senior management personnel to review reports on the entire portfolio, identifying investments with changes in market value of five percent or more, investments with changes in rating either by external rating agencies or internal analysts, investments segmented by issuer, industry, and foreign exposure levels, and any other relevant investment information to help identify the Companys exposure to possible credit losses. Based on this review of the entire investment portfolio, individual investments may be added to or removed from the Companys watch list, which is a list of securities subject to enhanced monitoring and a more intensive review. The Company also determines if its investment portfolio is overexposed to an issuer that is showing warning signs of deterioration and, if so, the Company makes no further purchases of that issuers securities and may seek opportunities to sell securities it holds from that issuer to reduce the Companys exposure. The Company monitors below investment grade securities as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio as an additional credit risk management strategy, looking specifically at the Companys exposure to individual securities currently classified as below investment grade. If the Company determines that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary, the investment is written down to fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period to the extent of the decline in value. If the decline is considered temporary, the security continues to be carefully monitored. These controls have been established to identify the Companys exposure to possible credit losses and are intended to give the Company the ability to respond rapidly. The Company has no held to maturity fixed maturity securities. All fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value. Fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. Private placement fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of approximately $3.7 billion, or 13.4 percent of total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2002, do not have readily determinable market prices. For these securities, the Company uses internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. Additionally, the Company obtains prices from independent third party brokers to establish valuations for certain of these securities. All such investments are classified as available for sale. The Companys ability to liquidate its positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market, and the Company may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner. Although the Company believes its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market. The Company 22 Table of Contents believes that generally these private placement securities carry a credit quality comparable to companies rated Baa or BBB by major credit rating organizations. As of December 31, 2002, the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following: Risk free interest rates of 2.73 percent for five year maturities to 4.76 percent for 30 year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for U.S. Treasury Bonds with similar maturities. Current Baa corporate bond spreads ranging from 1.26 percent to 2.87 percent plus an additional 30 basis points were added to the risk free rate to consider the lack of liquidity. An additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments. Additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk. Increasing the 30 basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by 1.5 basis points, increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point, and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the December 31, 2002 net unrealized gain in the fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately $1.3 million. Historically, the Companys realized gains or losses on dispositions of its private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above. Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, other than declines that are determined to be other than temporary, are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. If it is subsequently determined that any of these securities are other than temporarily impaired, the impairment loss is reported as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of income. The recognition of the impairment loss does not affect total stockholders equity to the extent that the decline in value had been previously reflected in other comprehensive income. There are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring the Companys fixed maturity securities for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities: The assessment of a borrowers ability to meet its contractual obligations will change. The economic outlook, either domestic or foreign, may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated, and as such, the security may not recover in value. New information may become available concerning the security, such as disclosure of accounting irregularities, fraud, or corporate governance issues. Significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry. Adverse rating agency actions may occur. Reinsurance Receivable Reinsurance is a contractual agreement whereby the Companys reinsurance partners assume a defined portion of the risk for future benefits payable under reinsurance contracts. The reinsurance receivable reported as an asset in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition includes amounts due from the Companys reinsurers on current claims and estimates of amounts that will be due on future claims. Policy reserves and claim reserves reported in the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition are not reduced for reinsurance. The reinsurance receivable is generally equal to the policy reserves and claim reserves related to the risk being reinsured. The Company reduces the reinsurance receivable if recovery is not likely due to the financial position of the reinsurer or if there is disagreement between the Company and the reinsurer regarding the liability of the reinsurer. Results of Operations This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein in Item 8. In the following financial statements and discussions of operating results by segment, operating revenue includes premium income, net investment income, and other income. Operating income or operating loss excludes federal income tax, net realized investment gains and losses, extraordinary losses, and cumulative effects of accounting principle changes.These alternative measures of revenue and income or loss differ from revenue and 23 Table of Contents income (loss) before federal income tax as presented in statements of income prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) due to the exclusion of before tax realized investment gains and losses.The Company believes operating revenue and operating income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses are useful measures of performance. The Companys investment focus is on investment income to support its insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses, and a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business. Realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and not necessarily related to decisions regarding underlying business. However, income excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income as a measure of the Companys profitability. Due to factors discussed under Risk Factors Investments contained herein in Item 1 and the Companys exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities, as discussed in a subsequent section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, the Company may experience realized investment losses. The realization of investment gains and losses will affect future earnings levels as the underlying business is long term in nature and requires that the Company be able to sustain the assumed interest rates in its liabilities. 2002 Significant Transactions and Events Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Transition to the provisions of SFAS 142 required the Company to complete, within the year of adoption, transitional impairment tests of goodwill existing at January 1, 2002, measured as of that date using a fair value approach. The Company had previously, prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, used undiscounted cash flows to determine if goodwill was recoverable. The Company completed the required tests during 2002 and determined the carrying value of its goodwill should be reduced $11.0 million. The charge, net of a $3.9 million tax benefit, was $7.1 million and is reported as a cumulative effect of accounting principle change in the consolidated statements of income. Application of the non amortization provision increased 2002 earnings $21.3 million before tax and $20.2 million after tax. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein for further discussion. In 2002, the Company completed two long term offerings, issuing $250.0 million of 7.375% senior debentures due June 15, 2032 and $150.0 million of 7.250% public income notes due June 15, 2032. The public income notes are redeemable at the Companys option, in whole or in part, on or after June 25, 2007. Proceeds from the offerings were used to refinance existing commercial paper borrowings. Continued declines in the performance of equity investment markets combined with steadily increasing pension liabilities have reduced the Companys pension plans funding level. In December 2002, in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), the Company recorded a $145.0 million non cash minimum pension liability adjustment, net of deferred federal income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The Company expects that its net periodic benefit cost, which is calculated in accordance with SFAS 87, may substantially increase in 2003 due to the recent decline in the stock market and the general decline in overall corporate bond yields that are used to establish the discount rate for projecting the benefit obligation. Based on projections as of December 31, 2002, the Company estimates its net periodic benefit cost for 2003 will be in the range of $50.0 million to $60.0 million compared to a $2.8 million net periodic benefit cost for 2002. During 2002, the Company acquired whereiwork, a provider of online solutions for insurance enrollment, communications, administration, and analysis, at a price of $2.8 million. This acquisition is intended to strengthen and broaden the Companys internet based benefits services currently offered to brokers and employers. The Companys insurance subsidiary in the United Kingdom entered into an agreement during 2002 with Sun Life Financial of Canada (Sun Life) to acquire Sun Lifes United Kingdom group income protection business together with the renewal rights to the group life business at a price of &pound;27.3 million (approximately $43.5 million). The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2003. 24 Table of Contents 2001 Significant Transactions and Events The September 11, 2001 tragedy resulted in a 2001 before tax charge of $24.0 million, or $15.6 million after tax. This charge included estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of $65.0 million less an estimated $41.0 million recoverable from the Companys reinsurers. The charge did not include any indirect costs which the Company incurred in developing specialized procedures for filing claims resulting from the attacks and in providing additional support to affected policyholders and group clients. The Companys reinsurance program provided a significant layer of catastrophic coverage for its individual disability and its group life, accidental death and dismemberment, travel accident, long term disability, and short term disability lines of business. The effects on each line of business are disclosed in the following discussions of segment operating results. During 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to limit its liabilities pertaining to the Lloyds syndicate participations. Separately, the Company also reinsured 100 percent of the group disability reinsurance reserves and all future business underwritten and managed by Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc., a subsidiary of D&H. The transaction, in which reserves of approximately $323.8 million were ceded to the reinsurer, had an effective date of January 1, 2001. In a separate but related transaction, the Company also sold the reinsurance management operations of Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc. and divested the remaining assets of that facility. During 2001, the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis certain cancer policies written by one of the Companys insurance subsidiaries and ceded approximately $113.6 million of reserves to the reinsurer. The transaction had an effective date of November 1, 2001. During 2001 the Company redeemed its $172.5 million par value 8.8% monthly income debt securities (junior subordinated debt), which were due in 2025 but callable at par in 2000 and thereafter. This early redemption was expected to lower the Companys financing costs in 2002 through the use of commercial paper available at lower interest rates. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a write off of the remaining deferred debt cost of $4.5 million associated with the issuance of the securities. The extraordinary loss, net of a $1.6 million tax benefit, was $2.9 million. In 2001, the Company acquired the assets of EmployeeLife.com, an Internet Capital Group partner company. This acquisition should enhance customer service by offering internet business solutions to help employers efficiently manage and administer employee benefits. The Company also acquired Resource Opportunities, Inc. (ROI), a national provider of medical and vocational case management services. ROI will improve GENEXs ability to service its customers, in turn benefiting the Companys insurance customers. Also in 2001, the Company sold Provident National Assurance Company, an inactive insurance subsidiary. Provident National Assurance Companys general account liabilities were reinsured by another subsidiary of the Company, and the excess capital and surplus was transferred to the parent to reduce short term borrowings. During 2001, the Company wrote off the remaining goodwill balance related to its operations in Argentina, resulting in a decrease in before tax and after tax operating income of $5.4 million. In 2001, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $35.2 million related to its investment in the foreign reinsurance operations, which lowered the 2001 tax rate below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35 percent. Additionally, as a result of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom during 2000 that allows additional group tax relief among companies with common ownership, the Company began recognizing foreign tax benefits during 2001. 2000 Significant Transactions and Events During 2000, the Company completed a series of strategic transactions designed to more closely focus its operations on its core businesses, increase its financial flexibility, support its present credit and claims paying ratings, increase the risk based capital ratios of the insurance subsidiaries involved, and lower its leverage ratios. The primary transaction involved agreements under which the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis substantially all of the individual life insurance and corporate owned life insurance policies written by the Companys insurance subsidiaries, as well as a small block of individually underwritten group life insurance. The reinsurance agreements were effective as of July 1, 2000. 25 Table of Contents Separately, the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis the future claim payments on one of the Companys insurance subsidiaries long duration group long term disability claims that were incurred prior to January 1, 1996. The agreement was effective January 1, 2000. During 2000, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement under which one of the Companys insurance subsidiaries will cede through a net quota share reinsurance agreement 50 percent of the group life volume above the aggregate retention limit. The treaties are five year quota share treaties ceding 25 percent of premium, life volume, and paid claims to each reinsurer. The reinsurance agreements were effective as of October 1, 2000. During 2000, the Company purchased a single premium annuity for its retirees, which allowed the release of the related pension plan liability and resulted in a net before tax gain of $116.1 million. The pension plan transaction enabled the Company to provide a higher level of administrative service for its retirees while also locking in favorable pension plan performance.

Sales The Company focuses on integrated selling that combines long term disability, short term disability, and group life products. During 2002, 27 percent of all new sales included long term disability, short term disability, and group life combined coverage. This compares to 28 percent and 32 percent in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company has closely linked its various incentive compensation programs to the achievement of its goals for new sales and persistency. Sales for Employee Benefits, on both a submitted and effective date basis, are reported in the following chart. Administrative services only (ASO) premium equivalents are now reported separately for long term and short term disability as the Company begins to emphasize more ASO and self insured business in the large case disability market. Certain other prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year reporting. 28 Table of Contents Sales for Employee Benefits, on both a submitted and effective date basis, are as follows: (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2002 % Change 2001 % Change 2000 Sales Submitted Date Basis Group Long term Disability Fully Insured $ 393.5 (0.9 )% $ 396.9 24.6 % $ 318.6 ASO Premium Equivalent 38.5 229.1 11.7 25.8 9.3 Group Short term Disability Fully Insured 130.0 (21.0 ) 164.5 14.8 143.3 ASO Premium Equivalent 162.1 62.6 99.7 140.2 41.5 Group Life 289.6 (16.7 ) 347.8 11.5 311.8 Accidental Death & Dismemberment 42.0 (23.2 ) 54.7 8.1 50.6 Group Long term Care 23.5 8.3 21.7 21.2 17.9 Total $ 1,079.2 (1.6 ) $ 1,097.0 22.8 $ 893.0 Sales Effective Date Basis Group Long term Disability Fully Insured $ 419.4 18.2 % $ 354.9 11.9 % $ 317.1 ASO Premium Equivalent 43.3 N.M. 10.7 52.9 7.0 Group Short term Disability Fully Insured 158.1 (2.7 ) 162.5 29.7 125.3 ASO Premium Equivalent 109.1 59.5 68.4 111.8 32.3 Group Life 311.7 (16.4 ) 372.9 60.1 232.9 Accidental Death & Dismemberment 45.1 (14.1 ) 52.5 5.2 49.9 Group Long term Care 25.6 27.4 20.1 4.1 19.3 Total $ 1,112.3 6.7 $ 1,042.0 32.9 $ 783.8 Fully insured sales, on a submitted date basis, for group long term disability decreased $3.4 million in 2002 compared to the prior year. The Companys U.S. operations reported a decrease of 3.8 percent, partially offset by a 19.4 percent sales increase in the Companys United Kingdom operations. Sales in the U.S. operations declined in all case size markets, with the largest decrease occurring in the small case market. Group long term disability ASO sales increased $26.8 million over 2001. Fully insured sales for short term disability were down 21.0 percent in 2002 compared to the prior year due to a decline in sales in all case size markets, offset partially by a 62.6 percent increase in ASO sales. Group life 2002 sales, relative to the prior year, decreased in all case size markets. This was partially due to the Companys strategic decision to focus on integrated sales of life and disability and less on stand alone life. In addition, two large group life cases totaling approximately $41.7 million were sold during 2001. Sales related to employee benefits can fluctuate significantly due to large case size and timing of sales submissions. In order to give the appropriate focus to the Companys primary business markets, the Company has national practice groups that focus on large employers, executive benefits, and voluntary benefits. These national practice groups partner with the Companys sales force and representatives from claims, customer service, and underwriting to present coverage solutions to potential customers and to manage existing customer accounts. The Company expects that this organizational focus on customers will continue to favorably affect sales growth, but management intends to maintain pricing discipline to balance sales growth and profitability, which may slow the rate of long term sales growth. Existing market share, as well as trends in new sales, are indicators of the Companys potential for growth in its respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new products. Negative media attention or downgrades in the financial strength ratings of the Companys insurance subsidiaries may adversely affect the Companys ability to grow sales and renew its existing business. 29 Table of Contents Persistency and Renewal of Existing Business The Company monitors persistency of its existing business and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current periods amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. One way in which the Company monitors persistency is at the overall block of business level (i.e., group long term disability, group short term disability, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment). Persistency, at the overall block of business level, is the year to date rate at which existing business for all issue years in the block of business at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period. In determining whether additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is required due to adverse persistency, the Company measures persistency by issue year (i.e., the rate at which existing business for that specific issue year at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period). The rate of persistency for an overall block of business may improve while individual issue years within the overall block of business may deteriorate and require additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Persistency during 2002 for the overall block of group long term disability on average improved from that experienced in 2001, but the persistency for group life and accidental death and dismemberment was lower than the prior year. Persistency for short term disability, after adjusting for cases transferring from fully insured to ASO, improved over the prior year. Persistency for group long term and short term disability, as well as group life and accidental death and dismemberment, was lower for certain issue years when compared to the persistency expected at the time the business was written. This resulted in additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $22.1 million for 2002. The additional amortization related to persistency in 2001 and 2000 was $41.5 million and $34.1 million, respectively. It is expected that persistency for the foreseeable future may continue to be lower than historical levels, particularly in certain issue years as the Company places increased emphasis on retaining profitable business. The Companys renewal programs have generally been successful at retaining business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated. It is expected that the additional premium and related profits associated with renewal activity will continue to emerge. The Company intends to maintain a disciplined approach in the re pricing of renewal business, while balancing the need to maximize persistency and retain producer relationships. This disciplined approach may lead to lower profit margins on affected renewal cases than originally planned. Group Disability Group disability reported operating revenue of $3,602.8 million for 2002 compared to $3,352.7 million for 2001. Operating income was $333.0 million for 2002 and $336.9 million for 2001. Operating income for 2001 included $7.3 million for losses related to September 11, 2001. Operating revenue improved due to increases in both premium income and net investment income. The $193.1 million growth in premium income compared to the prior year is due to new sales growth in 2001 and 2002 and favorable renewal activity on the existing block of business, offset partially by terminations. Net investment income grew $50.5 million primarily due to the growth in invested assets supporting this line of business. Included in other income are ASO fees of $33.9 million for 2002 and $25.7 million for the prior year. Partially offsetting the growth in operating revenue was an increase in the benefit ratio from 84.1 percent in 2001 to 84.4 percent in 2002. Group disability also experienced a slight increase in its commission ratio and increased operating expenses. Additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to persistency decreased in 2002 relative to 2001, but expected amortization, as determined when the costs were initially capitalized, continues to increase year over year due to the continued growth in the deferred policy acquisition cost asset balance related to new sales growth in the block of business. A critical part of the Companys strategy for group disability involves executing its renewal program and managing persistency, both of which management expects will have a positive effect on future profitability. The Company has implemented a pricing strategy in the group disability line wherein prices may increase or decrease by market segment, as appropriate, to respond to current claim experience and other factors and assumptions, although pricing changes typically lag by several quarters the changes in actual claim experience. 30 Table of Contents Persistency during 2002 on the overall block of group disability improved over 2001, with long term disability persistency at 85.8 percent compared to 84.9 percent in 2001. Short term disability persistency for 2002 was 81.5 percent versus 82.1 percent for the year 2001. Excluding the effects of cases that transferred from fully insured to ASO, short term disability persistency was 82.6 percent for 2002. Although the overall blocks of group long term and short term business experienced favorable persistency in 2002 compared to 2001, certain issue year business did not persist at the levels expected when the business was issued, resulting in $12.9 million of additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. The additional amortization for 2001 was $26.3 million. The 2002 benefit ratio for group disability was higher than in 2001, with the increase attributable to long term disability. Both submitted and paid claim incidence for group long term disability increased from 2001. This continues to be driven in part by economic trends, including lower consumer confidence. Industry segments contributing to the increased submitted incidence levels include wholesale/retail and manufacturing. Claim recovery rates for group long term disability in 2002 were lower than 2001 but were higher than 2000 and continued to be above historical levels. Continued lower claim recovery rates could require reserves to be increased. Payments to settle claims in litigation increased in 2002 compared to 2001 as did the number of new lawsuits filed. For short term disability, the 2002 benefit ratio was lower than in 2001. Paid claim incidence was marginally higher than 2001. The average weekly indemnity and premium per life continued to increase as expected, but the growth in premium per life was greater than the growth in the average weekly indemnity compared to the growth level relationships experienced in 2001. The average claim duration for closed short term disability claims was lower than in 2001. Group disability operating revenue was $3,352.7 million in 2001 compared to $3,200.4 million in 2000. Group disability reported operating income of $336.9 million for 2001 compared to $211.0 million for 2000. Operating income for 2001 includes $7.3 million for losses related to September 11, 2001. Included in the operating income for 2000 was an increase of $65.6 million for group long term disability claim reserves, which represented approximately 1.2 percent of total group long term disability claim reserves. The increase, which resulted from lengthening the projected average claim duration for certain of the Companys group long term disability claims, was not a result of deteriorating experience but was believed appropriate based on the Companys assessment of the ultimate resolution of these claims. Positive effects on 2001 operating income were a $152.3 million operating revenue increase and a change in the benefit ratio from 87.1 percent in 2000 to 84.1 percent in 2001, excluding losses related to September 11 for 2001 and the $65.6 million reserve increase for 2000. The commission ratio also improved slightly relative to 2000. Negatively affecting 2001 operating income was an increase in the operating expense ratio in 2001 compared to 2000. Persistency during 2001 on the overall block of group disability improved over 2000, with long term disability persistency at 84.9 percent compared to 81.6 percent in 2000 and short term disability at 82.1 percent versus 80.7 percent in 2000. The 2001 results include $26.3 million of additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for certain policy issue years necessitated by the higher level of group long term and short term disability terminations experienced during 2001 relative to that which was expected for those issue years at the time the business was written. The additional amortization during 2000 was $25.8 million. For both 2001 and 2000, the disability business retained was relatively more profitable than the business that terminated. The fundamentals underlying risk results in the group disability line continued to exhibit overall improvement in 2001, as demonstrated by the lower benefit ratio. Claim recovery rates in 2001 continued to be above historical levels but the increase in the claim recovery rates slowed, as expected, as the Company had fully implemented the improvements to its claim processes. Both submitted and paid claim incidence for long term disability increased over recent years, with a portion of the increase attributable to industries affected by the weaker economy. However, in comparing 2001 results with 2000, there was no significant increase in the types of claims normally associated with a weaker economy. For short term disability, both the average claim duration and paid incidence increased from 2000. The average weekly indemnity continued to increase as well, but the premium per life grew in 2001 at a slightly higher level. 31 Table of Contents As previously disclosed under Results of Operations, during 2000 the Company entered into a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance agreement to cede the future claim payments on one of its insurance subsidiaries long duration group long term disability claims which were incurred prior to January 1, 1996. The agreement was effective January 1, 2000. As discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements, certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the Companys business. Components of claims experience, including, but not limited to, incidence levels and claims duration, may be worse than expected. Management monitors claims experience in group disability and responds to changes by periodically adjusting prices, refining underwriting guidelines, changing product features, and strengthening risk management policies and procedures. The Company expects to price new business and re price existing business, at contract renewal dates, in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these and other factors, including interest rates, on new claim liabilities. Given the competitive market conditions for the Companys disability products, it is uncertain whether pricing actions can entirely mitigate the effect. The Company, similar to all financial institutions, has some exposure in a severe and prolonged economic recession, but management believes that the Company is well positioned to continue to endure the current economic downturn. Many of the Companys products can be re priced, which would allow the Company to reflect in its pricing any fundamental change which might occur in the risk associated with a particular industry or company within an industry. Although approximately 30 percent of the Companys overall block of group disability business is in the manufacturing and wholesale/retail industry segments, which tend to be economically sensitive, the Company has a well diversified book of insurance exposure, with no disproportionate concentrations of risk in any one industry. Because of changes made in recent years through the application of best practices in the claims organization, the Company believes it can respond to increased levels of submitted claims which might result from a further slowing economy. Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Long term Care Group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and long term care reported 2002 operating revenue of $1,938.4 million, an 8.6 percent increase over 2001, due to increases in premium income and net investment income. Operating income was $245.7 million in 2002 compared to $179.2 million in 2001. Results for 2001 included a net increase in benefits of $6.7 million related to September 11, 2001. Premium growth in 2002 relative to 2001 was attributable to favorable renewal results, strong sales results in 2001, and stable persistency. Persistency for group life, while improved from 2000 levels, was less favorable during 2002 than in 2001, with persistency of 83.9 percent compared to 84.6 percent for 2001. For accidental death and dismemberment, persistency was 82.4 percent for 2002 and 83.0 percent for 2001. The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for 2002 includes $9.2 million of additional amortization due to the higher level of terminations for group life products experienced during 2002 than expected at the time the policies were written. The results for 2001 included $15.2 million of additional amortization, with the unfavorable variance of actual to expected terminations occurring primarily in the group life product line. Group life reported an increase in operating income compared to the prior year. The improvement was attributable to a lower benefit ratio, lower commissions ratio, and an improved operating expense ratio. Submitted and paid claim incidence were both slightly higher than in 2001, but the rate trended downward throughout 2002 from the first quarter of 2002 high. The average paid claim size increased from 2001 and was high relative to historical levels. Incidence rates for group life waiver of premium coverage that results from a policyholders disability also increased slightly over 2001, but waiver recovery rates continued to increase as well. Group life 2001 results included a net increase in benefits of $3.0 million related to September 11, 2001. The Company has implemented several actions in the group life line of business, including tighter underwriting guidelines and pricing changes, and is developing case specific remedial plans for under performing business. The Company believes these actions will improve profitability for group life, but it is uncertain whether these actions will restore the profitability that this line of business has historically reported. As a result of these actions, it is expected that the sales growth rate in this business may continue at a lower level than that experienced in recent years. 32 Table of Contents Accidental death and dismemberment reported an increase in operating income for 2002 relative to 2001. The benefit ratio for accidental death and dismemberment decreased from 2001 as a result of lower incidence, partially offset by an increase in the average paid claim size. This line also benefited from reduced commission and expense ratios. The Company is discontinuing the sales of certain accidental death and dismemberment products but expects there may be continued volatility in this line of business. Results for 2001 for accidental death and dismemberment included a net increase in benefits of $3.7 million related to September 11, 2001. Operating income for group long term care increased in 2002 over 2001. The improvement resulted primarily from continued increases in premium income and a decrease in the benefit ratio. Submitted claim incidence exceeded 2001 levels, but decreased during the third and fourth quarters of 2002 from the high incidence experienced for the second quarter of 2002. The 2002 new claim rate exhibited a similar pattern, mostly due to an increase in the average size of new claims. Group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and long term care reported operating income of $179.2 million in 2001 compared to $214.0 million in 2000. Included in 2001 operating income is additional benefit expense of $6.7 million related to the September 11, 2001 tragedy. Group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and long term care reported an increase in operating revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 due to increases in both premium income and net investment income. Premium growth was attributable to strong sales results in 2001 and improvements in persistency. Persistency for group life was 84.6 percent in 2001, an increase over the 81.5 percent for 2000. For accidental death and dismemberment, persistency was 83.0 percent and 79.5 percent for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Offsetting the 2001 operating revenue increase was an increase in the benefit ratio and operating expense ratio when compared to the previous year reporting period. The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for 2001 includes $15.2 million of additional amortization due to the higher level of terminations for group life and accidental death and dismemberment products experienced than expected at the time the policies were written. The unfavorable variance of actual to expected terminations occurred primarily in the group life product line. Although the overall block of group life business experienced favorable persistency compared to the previous year, certain issue year business did not persist at the levels expected when the business was issued. The additional amortization during 2000 was $8.3 million. Group life submitted and paid incidence remained high in 2001, although the incidence rates during the last six months of the year were lower than the rates for the first half of 2001. The average paid claim size has also increased compared to the prior year, and waiver incidence continues to be above recent levels. The claim recovery rate on waiver claims has increased, somewhat mitigating the effect of the increase in waiver incidence. Group life 2001 benefits include estimated gross ultimate losses from reported and unreported claims of $17.0 million less an estimated $14.0 million recoverable from the Companys reinsurers, for a net increase in benefits of $3.0 million related to September 11, 2001. The 2001 benefit ratio for accidental death and dismemberment was higher than 2000 primarily due to a significant increase in the average paid claim amounts. The rate of claim incidence in 2001 did not change significantly over the prior year. The 2001 results for accidental death and dismemberment include estimated gross ultimate losses of $25.0 million less estimated reinsurance recoverables of $21.3 million, for a net increase in benefits of $3.7 million related to September 11, 2001. These losses relate to both accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident coverages. Group long term care reported a very slight decrease in the benefit ratio for 2001 compared to 2000, although the last two quarters of 2001 reported increasing benefit ratios relative to the first half of the year and to prior year quarters. Managed Disability Operating revenue from the managed disability line of business, which includes the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries GENEX Services, Inc. and Options and Choices, Inc., totaled $174.8 million in 2002, compared to $150.6 million in 2001 and $126.1 million in 2000. Operating income continues to increase due to the growth in operating revenue and increases in operating margins. 33 Table of Contents Individual Segment Operating Results (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2002 % Change 2001 % Change 2000 Operating Revenue Premium Income Individual Disability $ 1,661.0 0.8 % $ 1,647.8 0.3 % $ 1,643.5 Individual Long term Care 232.4 28.9 180.3 34.9 133.7 Total Premium Income 1,893.4 3.6 1,828.1 2.9 1,777.2 Net Investment Income 976.1 6.9 912.8 8.6 840.3 Other Income 92.8 7.0 86.7 (28.9 ) 122.0 Total 2,962.3 4.8 2,827.6 3.2 2,739.5 Benefits and Expenses Benefits and Change in Reserves for Future Benefits 2,088.7 8.1 1,932.7 4.0 1,858.4 Commissions 283.5 8.8 260.6 2.5 254.3 Deferral of Policy Acquisition Costs (225.4 ) 0.6 (224.1 ) 7.5 (208.4 ) Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs 102.3 (3.9 ) 106.4 16.8 91.1 Amortization of Value of Business Acquired 38.1 (13.6 ) 44.1 8.4 40.7 Operating Expenses 402.1 (3.6 ) 417.2 2.9 405.3 Total 2,689.3 6.0 2,536.9 3.9 2,441.4 Operating Income Before Federal Income Tax and Net Realized Investment Loss $ 273.0 (6.1 ) $ 290.7 (2.5 ) $ 298.1 The Individual segment includes results from the individual disability and individual long term care lines of business. Individual Disability New annualized sales in the individual disability line of business were $145.3 million in 2002, $145.1 million in 2001, and $116.1 million in 2000. Although sales were relatively flat between 2002 and 2001, it is expected that sales in the individual disability line should benefit from the focus on integrated disability sales in group and individual, as well as other sales initiatives discussed under Employee Benefits Segment Operating Results. The portion of individual disability sales attributable to multi life business was approximately 73 percent of 2002 sales, compared to 70 percent for 2001. The persistency of existing individual disability business continues to be stable. Operating revenue was $2,692.0 million for 2002 compared to $2,615.8 million in 2001. Premium income increased slightly less than one percent over the prior year, and net investment income increased 6.5 percent. Operating income in the individual disability line of business was $270.6 million in 2002 compared to $274.8 million in 2001. The benefit ratio for 2002 increased relative to the prior year. The interest adjusted loss ratio was 67.5 percent and 63.6 percent for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Submitted claim incidence for most of 2002 moderated after having increased throughout 2001, peaking in the first quarter of 2002. The increase in submitted incidence throughout 2001 and into the first quarter of 2002 has affected paid incidence, which was higher than 2001 and up significantly from 2000. The claim recovery rate remained below the level of 2001. Payments to settle claims in litigation increased in 2002 compared to 2001 while the number of new lawsuits filed decreased. Individual disability results benefited from an improvement in the operating expense ratio relative to 2001, somewhat offset by a slight increase in the commission ratio. Included in results for 2001 was an increase in net benefits of $10.0 million related to September 11, 2001. 34 Table of Contents The overall individual disability results continue to be negatively affected by the business issued during the mid 1990s and prior years. The interest adjusted loss ratio for recently issued business is significantly below the ratio for the older block, even in the more poorly performing market segments and product lines. The business issued in the mid 1990s and prior years experienced a significantly higher increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio during 2002 relative to 2001 than did the newer block of business. The higher interest adjusted loss ratio on the older business is driven by higher incidence and lower claim recoveries relative to more recently issued business. For the recently issued business, the majority of market segments experienced increases in the interest adjusted loss ratios during 2002 compared to 2001. Most of the market segments in the recently issued business are still performing within expectations. The improvement in recently issued business reflects the substantial product, distribution, and underwriting changes made during that time period. The Old individual disability block generally consists of those policies in force prior to the Companys substantial changes in product offerings, pricing, distribution, and underwriting. The Company continues to review internal and external alternatives, including reinsurance, for improving the overall results in its individual disability line of business, particularly as related to business issued in the mid 1990s and prior years. Operating revenue was $2,615.8 million for 2001 compared to $2,585.6 million in 2000. Operating income in the individual disability line of business was $274.8 million in 2001, a decrease of 3.7 percent over the prior year. Included in the results for 2001 was a $10.0 million increase in benefits related to September 11, 2001. Excluding this $10.0 million loss, operating income would have been essentially level with 2000. The benefit ratio of 107.7 percent for 2001 was slightly higher than the 2000 ratio of 106.6 percent. The interest adjusted loss ratio was 63.6 percent and 63.4 percent for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Submitted and paid claim incidence rates for the overall individual disability line of business increased from 2000 and were higher than recent historical incidence rates. The claim recovery rate for 2001 increased compared to the 2000 results. Individual disability also benefited from a slightly improved commission ratio for 2001 as compared to 2000, but the operating expense ratio increased. The overall individual disability results for 2001 were also negatively affected by the business issued during the mid 1990s and prior years. The interest adjusted loss ratios for later issue years are significantly below the overall ratio of 63.6 percent, even in the more poorly performing market segments and product lines. Individual Long term Care Operating revenue for individual long term care was $270.3 million, a 27.6 percent increase over 2001. Premium income increased $52.1 million for 2002 compared to 2001, primarily due to new sales growth. New annualized sales for long term care were $63.7 million for 2002, compared to $53.8 million for the prior year and $47.7 million for 2000. Net investment income continues to increase due to the growth in invested assets supporting this line of business. Persistency in this line of business remains high and stable. Changes in the product offering during 2003 may slow the growth in sales relative to historical trends. Operating income in the individual long term care line of business decreased to $2.4 million for 2002 compared to $15.9 million for 2001 due to an increase in the benefit ratio. The benefit ratio increase was driven primarily by the increase in active life reserves resulting from higher policy persistency and lower claim resolutions. The 2002 new claim rate, weighted by reserve dollar, exceeded the 2001 rate. The increase in the new claim rate over the prior year was driven by an increase in the average reserve size of new claims. Submitted incidence, by policy count rather than reserve dollar, decreased from the prior year. The claim recovery rate decreased from the prior year. The commission and operating expense ratios both improved relative to 2001. The individual long term care line of business reported a 35.0 percent increase in premium income for 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to new sales growth. Net investment income continues to increase due to the growth in this line of business. Operating income in the individual long term care line of business was $15.9 million in 2001 compared to $12.8 million for 2000, primarily due to an increase in operating revenue and an improvement in the commission and operating expense ratios. The benefit ratio increased when compared to 2000. The increase over the prior year resulted primarily from an increase in the active life reserve. Paid incidence was essentially unchanged from 2000, and the claim recovery rate increased. 35 Table of Contents Voluntary Benefits Segment Operating Results (in millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31 2002 % Change 2001 % Change 2000 Operating Revenue Premium Income $ 845.7 7.0 % $ 790.7 6.9 % $ 739.6 Net Investment Income 120.9 (3.0 ) 124.6 9.9 113.4 Other Income 15.5 14.8 13.5 114.3 6.3 Total 982.1 5.7 928.8 8.1 859.3 Benefits and Expenses Benefits and Change in Reserves for Future Benefits 520.0 6.2 489.8 9.5 447.2 Commissions 202.4 16.7 173.5 14.3 151.8 Deferral of Policy Acquisition Costs (216.7 ) 22.0 (177.6 ) 16.9 (151.9 ) Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs 139.3 10.5 126.1 12.3 112.3 Amortization of Value of Business Acquired 1.9 (17.4 ) 2.3 2.3 Operating Expenses 171.0 11.3 153.6 7.0 143.6 Total 817.9 6.5 767.7 8.8 705.3 Operating Income Before Federal Income Tax and Net Realized Investment Loss $ 164.2 1.9 $ 161.1 4.6 $ 154.0 The Voluntary Benefits segment includes the results of products sold to employees through payroll deduction at the workplace. These products include life insurance and health products, primarily disability, accident and sickness, critical illness, and cancer. Operating revenue in the Voluntary Benefits segment increased to $982.1 million in 2002 from $928.8 million in 2001 due to an increase in premium income in the disability and life product lines. The increase in 2002 was attributable to sales growth and favorable persistency. New annualized sales for 2002 were $336.6 million compared to $296.6 million for the prior year. The largest percentage increase year over year occurred in the critical illness product line, and the most significant growth in sales as measured by dollars of annualized premium occurred in disability. Management continues its efforts to increase sales through the sales initiatives discussed under Employee Benefits Segment Operating Results. Operating income for 2002 was $164.2 million compared to $161.1 million in 2001. The overall 2002 benefit ratio for this segment was slightly lower than 2001. The life and cancer product lines each reported a decrease in the benefit ratio compared to the prior year. Life paid claims, as well as the average claim size, declined in 2002 compared to 2001. The cancer block results benefited from the reinsurance transaction entered into during the fourth quarter of 2001, as previously discussed. The individual short term disability product reported an increase in the benefit ratio, primarily due to an increase in claim incidence and average indemnity relative to 2001. The average claim duration also increased over the prior year. The segment reported increases in the commission and operating expense ratios for 2002 relative to 2001. Operating revenue in the Voluntary Benefits segment increased to $928.8 million in 2001 from $859.3 million in 2000 primarily due to the increase in premium income attributable to sales growth and favorable persistency. New annualized sales for 2001 were $296.6 million, an increase of 11.9 percent over the prior year. For 2001, all of the product lines reported an increase in premium income and net investment income over 2000. The life and disability product lines both reported a marginal increase in the benefit ratio relative to 2000. The increase for life was due primarily to an increase in the size of the average paid claim. Claim payments for disability increased due to an increase in the average monthly indemnity and a lengthening of the duration of claims, but the incidence rates remained stable. The benefit ratio for the other line was higher in 2001 compared to 2000 36 Table of Contents due partially to the poor results from the block of business which was reinsured in the fourth quarter of 2001 and also due to an increase in the average claim size for the Companys other cancer products. As previously discussed, during 2001 the Company reinsured on a 100 percent indemnity coinsurance basis certain cancer policies written by the Companys subsidiary, Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company. The transaction closed during the fourth quarter with an effective date of November 1, 2001. The Company ceded approximately $113.6 million of reserves to the reinsurer. The $12.3 million before tax gain on this transaction was deferred and is being amortized into income based upon expected future premium income on the policies ceded. The Company will continue to market its other cancer products.

It is expected that operating revenue and income in this segment will decline over time as these business lines wind down. Management expects to reinvest the capital supporting these lines of business in the future growth of the Employee Benefits, Individual, and Voluntary Benefits segments. The closed blocks of business have been segregated for reporting and monitoring purposes. Reinsurance Pools and Management The Companys reinsurance operations include the reinsurance management operations of Duncanson & Holt, Inc. (D&H) and the risk assumption, which includes reinsurance pool participation; direct reinsurance which includes accident and health (A&H), long term care (LTC), and long term disability coverages; and Lloyds of London (Lloyds) syndicate participations. During 1999, the Company concluded that these operations were not solidly aligned with the Companys strength in the disability insurance market and decided to exit these operations through a combination of a sale, reinsurance, and or placing certain components in run off. In 1999, the Company sold the reinsurance management operations of its A&H and LTC reinsurance facilities and reinsured the Companys risk participation in these facilities. The Company also decided to discontinue its London accident reinsurance pool participation beginning in year 2000. With respect to Lloyds, the Company implemented a strategy which limited participation in year 2000 underwriting risks, ceased participation in Lloyds underwriting risks after year 2000, and managed the run off of its risk participation in open years of account of Lloyds reinsurance syndicates. During 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to limit its liabilities pertaining to the Lloyds syndicate participations. Separately, the Company also reinsured 100 percent of the group disability reinsurance reserves and all future business underwritten and managed by Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc., a subsidiary of D&H. The transaction, in which reserves of approximately $323.8 million were ceded to the reinsurer, had an effective date of January 1, 2001. In a separate but related transaction, the Company also sold the reinsurance management operations of Duncanson and Holt Services, Inc. and divested the remaining assets of that facility during 2001. 37 Table of Contents The reinsurance pools and management operations reported an operating loss of $3.2 million in 2002. Premium income was $16.7 million compared to $61.3 million and $398.7 million in 2001 and 2000. The premium income decline will continue as the Company exits from this business. During 2001, the reinsurance pools and management operations reported operating income of $0.1 million compared to an operating loss of $32.7 million in 2000. Included in the 2000 results were $37.4 million of charges related to the Companys London accident reinsurance pool participation. During 1999, the Company recorded charges of $270.1 million resulting from its decision to exit these pools, but at that time there was insufficient information to fully evaluate all of the exposures. During 2000, additional changes to fund these exposures and provide for the run off of its participation resulted in a claim reserve adjustment of $21.9 million and uncollectible receivables and loss provisions of $15.5 million. Individual Life and Corporate Owned Life As previously discussed, during 2000 the Company reinsured substantially all of the individual life and corporate owned life insurance blocks of business. The Company ceded approximately $3.3 billion of reserves to the reinsurer. The $388.2 million before tax gain on these transactions was deferred and is being amortized into income based upon expected future premium income on the traditional insurance policies ceded and estimated future gross profits on the interest sensitive insurance policies ceded. The unamortized balance of the deferred gain was $313.8 million at December 31, 2002 and $343.9 million and $373.5 million at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company recognized a 2000 before tax realized investment loss of $25.9 million on the fixed maturity securities transferred to the reinsurer. In connection with this realized loss, the Company retrospectively adjusted deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired related to interest sensitive individual life policies with credits to current period amortization of $9.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, to reflect investment experience. Total operating revenue for individual life and corporate owned life insurance was $42.1 million, $42.7 million, and $236.1 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Operating income for the same periods was $41.6 million, $38.9 million, and $49.6 million. Other Group pension, health insurance, individual annuities, and other closed lines of business had operating revenue of $159.9 million, $201.3 million, and $219.4 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000 and operating income of $7.2 million, $14.3 million, and $26.4 million. Decreases in operating revenue and income are expected to continue as these lines of business wind down. Included in these amounts are the Companys operating results for its operations in Argentina, which produced operating revenue of $18.4 million, $47.1 million, and $40.2 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000 and operating income of $0.1 million, $1.1 million, and $2.7 million in each of those three years. As previously mentioned, the Company in 2001 wrote off the remaining goodwill balance of $5.4 million related to its operations in Argentina. The goodwill write off is included in the Corporate segment operating results. The net assets related to the Argentina operations were approximately $1.8 million at December 31, 2002. Corporate Segment Operating Results The Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, corporate interest expense, amortization of goodwill (prior to 2002), and certain corporate expenses not allocated to a line of business. Operating revenue in the Corporate segment was $35.6 million in 2002, $44.6 million in 2001, and $48.1 million in 2000. The Corporate segment reported operating losses of $154.5 million in 2002, $169.2 million in 2001, and $49.5 million in 2000. The improvement in 2002 relative to 2001 was due primarily to a reduction in interest and debt expense as well as the cessation of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of SFAS 142. Results for 2000 were positively affected by the gain of $116.1 million on the pension plan transaction. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys pension plan. 38 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense was $162.4 million in 2002, $169.6 million in 2001, and $181.8 million in 2000. Interest in 2003 is expected to increase relative to 2002 due to the issuance of two long term debt offerings during the second quarter of 2002 which were used to refinance existing commercial paper borrowings. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information on the debt offerings. The amortization of goodwill was $26.6 million in 2001 and $22.3 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 amortization was a $5.4 million write down of goodwill related to the Companys Argentina operations. See previous discussion under Other Segment Operating Results. Investments Overview Investment activities are an integral part of the Companys business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results. Invested assets are segmented into portfolios that support the various product lines. Generally, the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of the Companys business. The Company seeks to maximize investment income and total return and to assume credit risk in a prudent and selective manner, subject to constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations. The Companys overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of its insurance products. Assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities, and the portfolio is matched with liabilities so as to eliminate as much as possible the Companys exposure to changes in the overall level of interest rates. The Company invests for the long term, with the weighted average duration of its liability portfolio approximately 8.52 years at December 31, 2002. The weighted average duration of the Companys investment portfolio was 7.50 years at December 31, 2002, and the weighted average rating was A. The Company is able to hold to this investment philosophy throughout a credit cycle because of its capital position, the fixed nature of its liabilities, and the matching of those liabilities with assets and also because of the experience gained through many years of a consistent investment philosophy. It is the Companys intent, and has been its practice, to hold investments to maturity to meet liability payments. The Companys investment philosophy is also designed to take advantage of the expertise it has developed over the years in the below investment grade fixed maturity market. This allows the Company to attain higher yield and increase diversification of assets while at the same time not substantially increasing its asset risk profile. As noted in the investment policy discussion below, the Companys investments in this asset category are subject to limits and closely monitored. Below is a summary of the Companys formal investment policy, including the overall quality and diversification objectives. The majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of the Companys portfolios. The long term nature of the Companys insurance liabilities also allows it to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns. A maximum of 10 percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade investments, two percent in equity type instruments, and up to 35 percent in private placements. The remaining assets can be held in mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, and municipal securities. The Company does not currently intend to invest in additional commercial mortgages or real estate. The Company intends to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities to within a range of +/ 3 years. The weighted average rating of the portfolio should be BBB or higher. 39 Table of Contents The maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits established by the Companys board of directors and is more restrictive than the 5 percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments the Companys insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own. These internal limits are as follows: Rating Internal Limit ($ in millions) AAA/A $150 BBB 100 BBB 75 BB/BBB 60 BB 50 B/BB 40 B 20 The portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines. Derivative instruments may be used to hedge interest rate risk and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan approved by the board of directors. Asset mix guidelines and limits are established by the Company and approved by the board of directors. The allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification by the investment subcommittee of the board of directors on a weekly basis. These actions are also reviewed and approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis. These investment policies and guidelines are reviewed and appropriately adjusted by the board of directors annually, or more frequently if deemed necessary. To allow the Company flexibility during the current challenging environment, the board of directors at its September 2002 meeting modified the above investment guidelines to establish an individual credit over exposure limit at 5 percent of invested assets and a below investment grade over exposure limit of 5 percent of invested assets. Investment Results Excluding the net investment income reported in the Other segment, which continues its expected decline as these product lines are sold, reinsured, or wind down, 2002 net investment income increased 6.2 percent over the previous year. The overall yield in the portfolio was 7.76 percent as of December 31, 2002, compared to 8.02 percent and 8.06 percent at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company expects that the portfolio yield will continue to gradually decline, due to yields on new purchase activity, until the level of market rates increases. The Company is actively marketing selected properties in its real estate and mortgage loan portfolios for replacement with longer duration securities. The Company reported a before tax net realized investment loss of $315.0 million, comprised of gross gains of $208.2 million and gross losses of $523.2 million, of which $454.4 million related to write downs on fixed maturity and equity securities. These write downs were recognized as a result of managements determination that the value of certain fixed maturity and equity securities had other than temporarily declined during the applicable quarter of 2002, as well as the result of further declines in the values of fixed maturity and equity securities that had initially been written down in a prior period. The value of the securities was determined to have other than temporarily declined or to have further declined from the initial impairment based on the factors discussed herein in Critical Accounting Policies. Due to the current negative credit market environment and the associated economic uncertainty, the Company anticipates additional investment losses will occur during 2003. Approximately 62 percent of the 2002 write downs occurred in the communications industry. The following list includes write downs representing five percent or greater of the total 2002 write downs, the circumstances that contributed to the write downs, the length of time the security had been in a continual loss position, whether it was investment grade or below investment grade at the time of initial purchase and at the time of the write down, and how the circumstances of the write down might cause impairments in other material investments held by the 40 Table of Contents Company. Approximately 53 percent of the 2002 write downs were recorded for reasons other than bankruptcy or defaults on principal or interest payments. Due to the circumstances of certain write downs recorded during 2002, the Company now relies less on the parental support of an issuer in determining whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred. $51.1 million loss during the second quarter of 2002 on securities issued by a Canadian telecommunications company engaged in transporting voice and data over its global fiber optic network. This company had an investment grade rating of Baa3 immediately prior to the time its parent company unexpectedly withdrew its support for the subsidiary in April 2002. The investment was subsequently downgraded to below investment grade in the second quarter of 2002. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years. The Company owns fixed maturity securities issued by another regulated subsidiary under common ownership, but this investment has not been negatively impacted, is not considered impaired, and was in an unrealized gain position at December 31, 2002. $27.8 million loss during the second quarter of 2002 on securities issued by a U.S. based global telecommunications company providing global voice and data services. It was discovered in June 2002 that the company had misclassified certain expenses, materially changing the reported financial condition and profitability of the business. The investment was rated Baa2 just prior to its downgrade to below investment grade in the second quarter of 2002. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than one year but less than two years. The circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments. $25.1 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2002 on securities issued by a subsidiary of a U.S. based company engaged in the electricity business in the United Kingdom. As this industrys operating environment in the United Kingdom weakened over the past few years due to competitive pricing pressures, the company remained encumbered with a number of above market price power purchase agreements resulting in significant operating losses. The parent company had previously provided equity support and had committed an additional $700.0 million to this subsidiary to be used primarily to renegotiate these contracts. The investment was rated Baa3 just prior to the time the parent company unexpectedly withdrew its promised support in October 2002, which resulted in a downgrade to below investment grade. The company defaulted on its October interest payments, and the parent company was subsequently placed in administration in the United Kingdom. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years. The Company holds securities in a related subsidiary and has also recognized an other than temporary impairment loss on that related subsidiary. $23.2 million loss during the first quarter of 2002 on securities issued by the holding company of a large national wholesale communications company. In the third quarter of 2001 the company reported sales of $298 million, a 42 percent increase over the comparable prior year period, and liquidity of $1.4 billion in cash equivalents. It was expected that the company would use the proceeds from the sale of non core assets to further supplement liquidity. In January 2002, the companys banks agreed to extend the negotiating period for an amendment to the credit agreement until the end of February 2002. During the first quarter of 2002, the company reported fourth quarter 2001 results, including an 11 percent increase in revenue to $330.3 million. The company had cash equivalents in excess of $1.0 billion, an indication that the company had sufficient liquidity to fund its business plan through 2003. However, late in the first quarter of 2002, the companys banks unexpectedly refused to allow the company to draw on its credit lines. The company reported that it would seek bankruptcy protection. Both Moodys and Standard & Poors downgraded the security during the first quarter of 2002. The investment was originally purchased as part of the Companys below investment grade strategy. At the time of the write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than one year but less than two years. The circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments. 41 Table of Contents The Company reported a before tax net realized investment loss of $99.1 million in 2001. The loss was the net of gains of $150.6 million and losses of $249.7 million, including write downs of $212.3 million recognized as a result of managements determination that the value of certain fixed maturity securities had other than temporarily declined. Approximately 50 percent of the 2001 write downs occurred in the communications sector. The following list includes write downs representing five percent or greater of the total 2001 write downs, the circumstances that contributed to the write downs, and how those circumstances might cause impairments in other material investments held by the Company. $29.0 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2001 on securities issued by a global integrated telecommunications company, after the company announced in January 2002 that it would be seeking bankruptcy protection. The company had approximately $2 billion of cash as of September 30, 2001, the most recent reporting date prior to the write down. The investment was originally purchased as part of the Companys below investment grade strategy. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than one year but less than two years. The circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments. $23.6 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2001 on securities issued by a leading U.S. based energy company. This company had an investment grade rating prior to allegations of fraud and accounting irregularities in November 2001. The company subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2001. The investment was downgraded to a below investment grade status in the fourth quarter of 2001. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than 180 days but less than 270 days. The Company owns senior notes of a related entity. This security was current on principal and interest payments at December 31, 2002. The Company also owns securities of another related entity, a utility company that services an industrial site in England and whose 98 percent parent filed for insolvency in December 2001. The subsidiary was excluded from this insolvency filing due to the financial separation from the parent and was operating as a going concern during 2001. $18.6 million loss during the second quarter of 2001 on securities issued by a global integrated web hosting, data, and telecommunications company, after the company unexpectedly declined to make an interest payment on another senior note in May 2001 even though the company had sufficient available cash. The investment was originally purchased as part of the Companys below investment grade strategy. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years. The circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments. $15.7 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2001 on a provider of local and long distance telephone service and internet service after the company reported in November 2001 that it might seek to restructure its debt. This investment was originally purchased as part of the Companys below investment grade strategy. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years. The circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments. $15.0 million loss during the third quarter of 2001 on securities issued by an internet data and web hosting company, after it was deemed probable in September 2001 that the company might seek to restructure. The investment was originally purchased as part of the Companys below investment grade strategy. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period greater than one year but less than two years. The circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments. $14.8 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2001 on securities issued by a large manufacturer of wheels for automobiles, after the company announced in December 2001 that it would seek bankruptcy protection. The company also announced in September 2001 that it would restate results for the previous year and first quarter of the current year because of accounting errors and issued restated results in the fourth quarter of 2001. The investment was originally purchased as part of the Companys below investment grade strategy. Prior to its write down, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years. The circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments. 42 Table of Contents During 2000, the Company reported a net realized investment loss before tax of $53.5 million, including the realized investment loss of $25.9 million on the investment grade fixed maturity securities transferred to the reinsurer in connection with the individual life and corporate owned life reinsurance transactions. The loss on these transferred securities was driven by a change in market interest rates and was not attributable to any credit deterioration. Excluding the reinsurance transaction related loss, the Company reported a net gain of $51.0 million in 2000 from the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities. Offsetting this gain was a $132.9 million realized investment loss recognized because the value of certain fixed maturity securities had other than temporarily declined. Asset Distribution The following table provides the distribution of invested assets for the periods indicated. Ceded policy loans of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, which are reported on a gross basis in the statements of financial condition contained herein in Item 1, are excluded from the table below. The investment income on these ceded policy loans is not included in income.

The Companys current view of risk factors relative to these four industries is as follows: Basic Industries: This sector is comprised of several cyclical, commodity based industries, including sub sectors of mining, chemicals, metals, and forest products. The down cycle in the economy reduced demand for many of these commodities, and the combination of low prices, low capacity utilization, and, in some cases, high raw material prices continue to pressure many of the companies in these sub sectors. If the economy improves, these cyclical businesses should recover, and the bonds issued by these companies should recover as well. The Company has held these sub sectors through several economic cycles and has the ability and intent to hold these investments until they recover in value or reach maturity. The portfolio should also benefit from the Companys credit selection process which seeks to avoid the riskier credits in these sub sectors. Communications: The communications sector experienced rapid growth and debt financed expansion following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which encouraged new entrants and competition. By early 2001, capacity greatly exceeded demand, and industry conditions deteriorated rapidly. The result has been numerous bankruptcies and allegations of fraud, some involving large world class companies. These bankruptcies will result in lower cost structures, which will place additional pressure on the remaining companies. The Companys strategy has been to focus on the top tier companies and those with diversified product offerings. The Company expects conditions to remain difficult but show improvement as the economy recovers. 44 Table of Contents Financial Institutions: This sector entered the recent economic slowdown with record capital levels and strong profitability. Bank balance sheets appear capable, in general, of withstanding the increased loan write offs typically seen in past recessions. In addition to the communications industry, banks are now experiencing more loan write offs from the energy and utility industries. Finance companies, both consumer and commercial, can also be expected to experience an increase in non performing receivables. The degree of the economic slowdown will be a key determinant of the amount of credit degradation in the financial services sector. Utilities: This sector, which includes regulated electric utilities, gas transmission and distribution companies, and independent power projects, has been operating in a difficult environment since 2000. The California power crisis in 2000 and 2001 impacted both electric and gas providers outside of California as issues regarding energy trading and a flawed deregulatory model provoked national scrutiny. Enrons bankruptcy filing in late 2001 exacerbated the issues and resulted in numerous negative rating agency actions as the agencies developed a stricter model for analyzing industry participants. This in turn has contributed to decreased financial liquidity for many of the national utilities and resulted in numerous proposed asset sales as companies attempt to restructure their balance sheets. The Company believes that this sector will stabilize over the intermediate term (one to two years) as the industry works its way through the issues and then improve as the economy rebounds and participants realize the benefits of their current restructuring initiatives. Of the $1.1 billion in gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2002, $210.6 million or 19.7 percent are related to investment grade fixed maturity bonds. Unrealized losses on investment grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities. These changes are generally temporary and are not recognized as realized investment losses unless the securities are sold or become other than temporarily impaired. The gross unrealized loss on below investment grade fixed maturity bonds was $856.1 million at December 31, 2002, or 80.3 percent of the total gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity bonds. Generally, below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns. The following table shows the length of time the Companys investment grade fixed maturity bonds had been in a gross unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2002.

The carrying value and gross unrealized losses are categorized by the relationship of the current market value to amortized cost for those securities on December 31, 2002. The market value to amortized cost relationships are not necessarily indicative of the market value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of the relationships subsequent to December 31, 2002. 45 Table of Contents Unrealized Loss on Below Investment Grade Fixed Maturity BondsLength of Time in Unrealized Loss PositionAs of December 31, 2002 (in millions of dollars) Carrying Value Gross Unrealized Loss LT 90 days Carrying value LT100% 70% of amortized cost $ 278.5 $ (59.1 ) Carrying value LT 70% 40% of amortized cost 90.0 (49.7 ) Carrying value LT 40% of amortized cost 0.4 (0.8 ) Subtotal 368.9 (109.6 ) 90LT 180 days Carrying value LT100% 70% of amortized cost 384.5 (52.0 ) Carrying value LT 70% 40% of amortized cost 32.4 (17.3 ) Carrying value LT 40% of amortized cost 27.5 (63.1 ) Subtotal 444.4 (132.4 ) 180LT 270 days Carrying value LT100% 70% of amortized cost 364.5 (52.7 ) Carrying value LT 70% 40% of amortized cost 63.2 (61.0 ) Carrying value LT 40% of amortized cost 17.4 (51.7 ) Subtotal 445.1 (165.4 ) 270 days LT 1 year Carrying value LT100% 70% of amortized cost 39.5 (7.5 ) Carrying value LT 70% 40% of amortized cost 110.7 (75.1 ) Carrying value LT 40% of amortized cost 13.3 (53.1 ) Subtotal 163.5 (135.7 ) 1 yearLT 2 years Carrying value LT100% 70% of amortized cost 211.5 (25.8 ) Carrying value LT 70% 40% of amortized cost 146.0 (110.1 ) Carrying value LT 40% of amortized cost 4.6 (7.6 ) Subtotal 362.1 (143.5 ) 2 yearsLT 3 years Carrying value LT100% 70% of amortized cost 128.5 (26.1 ) Carrying value LT 70% 40% of amortized cost 31.9 (23.8 ) Carrying value LT 40% of amortized cost 0.9 (2.2 ) Subtotal 161.3 (52.1 ) 3 years Carrying value LT100% 70% of amortized cost 91.1 (13.9 ) Carrying value LT 70% 40% of amortized cost 61.2 (42.1 ) Carrying value LT 40% of amortized cost 20.2 (61.4 ) Subtotal 172.5 (117.4 ) Totals $ 2,117.8 $ (856.1 ) 46 Table of Contents As previously discussed under Critical Accounting Policies contained herein, in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, the Company utilizes a formal, well defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate its fixed income investment portfolio. It includes certain members of senior management in addition to the day to day investment and accounting professionals. The process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and write downs on a timely basis of investments determined to have an other than temporary impairment. For those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss and on which the Company has not recorded an impairment write down, the Company believes that the decline in fair value below amortized cost is temporary. The Company has the ability to hold its securities to the earlier of recovery or maturity and intends to hold all of its fixed maturity investments until maturity to meet its liability obligations. If information becomes available that changes the Companys assessment as to whether the Company will receive contractual payments related to a fixed maturity security and the security is also not projected to recover in value, the related security is generally sold. The Company may also in certain circumstances sell a security because of industry or environmental issues, to extend the duration of the investment portfolio, due to mergers between issuers which result in positions in excess of the Companys investment guidelines, and to take advantage of tender offers. The following is a distribution of the maturity dates for fixed maturity bonds in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2002.

These securities had a book value of $250.8 million and a fair value of $187.8 million at the time of sale and represented 42 different issuers. Losses representing five percent or more of the total are as follows: The Company realized $34.0 million in losses on the sale of securities issued by a U.S. based global telecommunications company providing global voice and data services, representing 54.1 percent of the total realized investment loss on sales of fixed maturity securities in 2002. This company had misclassified certain expenses, materially changing the reported financial condition and profitability of the business. The price of this issuers securities dropped significantly in the second quarter of 2002 as the information became public. This company is under multiple investigations, and several senior officers of the issuer have been accused of committing major accounting fraud. These circumstances were significant enough for the Company to change its intent to hold these securities to maturity or recovery. The investment was downgraded to below investment grade in the second quarter of 2002, and, at the time of sale, had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than 90 days but less than 180 days. The circumstances of this investment have no impact on other investments. The Company realized $5.9 million in losses on the sale of securities issued by an energy services company engaged in offshore seismic surveying and floating energy production, representing 9.3 percent of the total realized investment loss on sales of fixed maturity securities in 2002. Industry conditions in the energy sector, which is cyclical and driven by the supply and demand for oil and gas, had impacted profit margins, and the company lacked liquidity in the near term. The investment was downgraded to below investment grade status in the second quarter of 2002, causing the investment holdings of this issuer to exceed the Companys individual issuer group limits established by the Companys board of directors. As a result, the Company sold the securities in order to lower its overall holding of securities issued by this company. At the time of sale, the investment had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of more than three years. The circumstances of this investment have no impact on other investments. The Company realized $3.9 million in losses on the sale of a below investment grade structured security backed by a pool of high yield bonds, representing 6.1 percent of the total realized investment loss on fixed maturity securities in 2002. The continued high level of defaults in the high yield market and in this pool in particular continued to impact the credit quality of this investment. A review of the investment led to the conclusion that, while a decline in the level of defaults in the general market was expected, no improvement in the prospects for this structured security was expected. This conclusion resulted from the deterioration of the underlying pool of high yield bonds and the deteriorating performance record of the pools manager. The investment was downgraded to below investment grade status in the third quarter of 2001 and, at the time of sale, had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than 270 days but less than 360 days. The Companys investment in mortgage backed and asset backed securities was approximately $5.0 billion and $3.8 billion on an amortized cost basis at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2002, the mortgage backed securities had an average life of 5.0 years and effective duration of 2.7 years. The mortgage backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities. The primary risk involved in investing in mortgage backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal. The Company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates. The Company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives, such as interest only, principal only or residuals, where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates. The Companys exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2002, was $2,872.8 million, representing 10.0 percent of the carrying value of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans, below the Companys internal limit for this type of investment. The Companys exposure to below investment grade fixed maturities totaled $2,261.7 million at December 31, 2001, or 8.7 percent of invested assets. The year over year increase resulted from downgrades of existing securities that were previously investment grade rather than the purchase of additional below investment grade securities. 49 Table of Contents Below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher. Also, the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid. The Company expects additional downgrades may occur during 2003 and that the Company may experience additional other than temporary impairments in 2003. However, the Company does not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by the investments in below investment grade securities, nor does it expect these investments to adversely affect its ability to hold its other investments to maturity. The Company has investments in five special purpose entities whose purposes are to support the Companys investment objectives. These entities are for asset collateralization and contain specific investment securities that do not include the Companys common stock or debt. These investments are described as follows: During 2002 and 2001, the Company invested in three special purpose entity trusts that have underlying assets consisting of unaffiliated equity securities. The investments in these trusts qualify as fixed maturity securities under generally accepted accounting principles and are reported at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition contained herein. The fair value of these investments was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. The fair value and amortized cost of these investments were $84.4 million and $113.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and $50.5 million and $58.1 million at December 31, 2001. The Company has an investment in a collateralized bond obligation asset trust in which it is also the investment manager of the underlying high yield securities. This investment was reported at fair value with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of this investment was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. The fair value and amortized cost of this investment was $6.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002, and $20.4 million and $46.0 million at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, the Company had a retained interest in a special purpose entity trust that was securitized with financial assets consisting of a United States Treasury bond and several limited partnership equity interests. This investment was reported at fair value and included with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of this investment was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets. The fair value and amortized cost of this investment was $123.5 million and $127.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002, and $113.6 million and $122.6 million at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, the Company had capital commitments of $14.1 million to this special purpose entity trust. These funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from the trust. These amounts may or may not be funded during the term of the trust. Mortgage Loans and Real Estate The Companys mortgage loan portfolio was $599.9 million and $941.2 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types. The incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity remains low, and management expects the level of delinquencies and problem loans to remain low in the future. One purchase money mortgage associated with the sale of real estate was added to the Companys investment portfolio during 2002. For the years 2001 and 2000, the only additions were related to two purchase money mortgages associated with the sale of real estate. The Company sold mortgage loans with a book value of $95.1 million during 2002, resulting in a before tax realized investment gain of $1.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, impaired mortgage loans totaled $6.0 million and $13.1 million, respectively. Impaired mortgage loans are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. Restructured mortgage loans totaled $7.8 million and $5.7 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and represent loans that have been refinanced with terms more favorable to the borrower. Interest lost on restructured loans was immaterial for 2002 and 2001. 50 Table of Contents Real estate was $37.1 million and $51.8 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets the Companys investment criteria. If investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value. Occasionally, investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets the Companys investment criteria. Real estate held for sale, which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell, amounted to $8.2 million and $7.6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company uses a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each mortgage loan and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation. The Company establishes an investment valuation allowance for mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio, considering the value of the underlying collateral. Investment valuation allowances for real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets. If a decline in value of a mortgage loan or real estate investment is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired, the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value, and the reduction is recognized as a realized investment loss. Management monitors the risk associated with these invested asset portfolios and regularly reviews and adjusts the investment valuation allowance. As a result of managements 2001 reviews of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and based on managements expectations that delinquencies and problem loans would remain low, the valuation allowance on mortgage loans was reduced $10.5 million during 2001. The real estate valuation allowance was reduced $5.7 million during 2001 in conjunction with the sale of the associated property. No changes were made to the allowances during 2002. At December 31, 2002, the balance in the valuation allowances for mortgage loans and real estate was $2.4 million and $19.9 million, respectively. Other The Companys exposure to non current investments totaled $205.8 million at December 31, 2002, or 0.7 percent of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans. These non current investments are fixed income securities and mortgage loans that became more than thirty days past due in principal and interest payments. Approximately $74.2 million of these investments had principal and interest payments past due for a period greater than one year. The Company has an investment program wherein it simultaneously enters into repurchase agreement transactions and reverse repurchase agreement transactions with the same party. The Company nets the related receivables and payables in the consolidated statements of financial condition as these transactions meet the requirements for the right of offset. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $499.3 million face value of these agreements in an open position that were offset. The Company also uses the repurchase agreement market as a source of short term financing. The Company had $235.0 million face value of these contracts that were included in short term debt in the consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2002. Historically, the Company has utilized interest rate futures contracts, current and forward interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, and options on forward interest rate swaps, forward treasuries, or forward contracts on specific fixed income securities to manage duration and increase yield on cash flows expected from current holdings and future premium income. Positions under the Companys hedging programs for derivative activity that were open during 2002 involved current and forward interest rate swaps and forward contracts on credit spreads on specific fixed income securities, as well as currency swaps which are used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency denominated fixed income securities. All transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative. Almost all transactions are associated with the individual and group long term care and the individual and group disability product portfolios. All other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes. During 2002, the Company recognized net gains of $45.4 million on the termination of cash flow hedges and reported $42.1 million in other comprehensive income and $3.3 million as a component of realized investment gains and losses. The Company amortized $12.4 million of net deferred gains into net investment income during 2002. The Companys current credit exposure on derivatives, which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, was $52.2 million at December 31, 2002. Additions and terminations, in notional amounts, to the Companys hedging programs for 2002, were $1,029.6 million and $771.9 million, respectively. The notional amount of derivatives outstanding under the hedge programs was $1,382.8 million at December 31, 2002. 51 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in its insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash. Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions), and operating expenses as well as purchases of new investments. The Company has established an investment strategy that management believes will provide for adequate cash flows from operations. Cash flows from operations were $1,786.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $1,770.6 million and $1,211.5 million for the comparable periods of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys source of cash could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for the Companys insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims. The Companys policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and the Company therefore has minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities. Cash flow could also be negatively impacted by a deterioration in the credit market whereby the Companys ability to liquidate its positions in certain of its fixed maturity securities would be impacted such that the Company might not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner. The Company believes that cash flows will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. The Company is dependent upon payments from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its stockholders and to pay its expenses. These payments by the Companys insurance and non insurance subsidiaries may take the form of interest payments on amounts loaned to such subsidiaries by the Company, operating and investment management fees, and or dividends. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding from its insurance subsidiaries a $150.0 million surplus debenture due in 2006 with a weighted average interest rate during 2002 of 8.19 percent and a $100.0 million surplus debenture due in 2027 with a weighted average interest rate during 2002 of 8.25 percent. Semi annual interest payments are conditional upon the approval by the insurance department of the state of domicile. Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities. For life insurance companies domiciled in the United States, that limitation equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurers statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year, depending on the state of domicile. Further, pursuant to the 1999 merger of Unum and Provident, the Company is required to obtain approval from the Maine Bureau of Insurance (Maine Bureau) regarding payment of ordinary dividends from the Companys Maine domiciled insurance subsidiary until 2004. The payment of ordinary dividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries is further limited to the amount of statutory surplus as it relates to policyholders. Based on the restrictions under current law, during 2003 $328.5 million is available for the payment of ordinary dividends to the Company from its domestic insurance subsidiaries. Of this amount, $113.1 million is conditional upon approval from the Maine Bureau. The Company also has the ability to draw a dividend from its United Kingdom based affiliate, Unum Limited. Such dividends are limited in amount, based on insurance company law in the United Kingdom, which requires a minimum solvency margin. Approximately $94.6 million will be available for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2003. The amount available during 2002 for the payment of ordinary dividends from the Companys domestic insurance subsidiaries was $384.9 million, including $121.8 million available with approval from the Maine Bureau. Of the total available, $165.0 million was utilized, including $40.0 million as requested by the Company and approved by the Maine Bureau. The amount available during 2002 from Unum Limited was $27.5 million, none of which was utilized. The ability of the Company to continue to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval will be dependent upon the level of earnings of its insurance subsidiaries as calculated under law. In addition to regulatory restrictions, the amount of dividends that will be paid by insurance subsidiaries will depend on additional factors, such as risk based capital ratios, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support the ratings desired by the Company. Regulatory 52 Table of Contents restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution to the Company from its non insurance subsidiaries. The Companys risk based capital (RBC) ratio for its U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was 210 percent and 250 percent at the end of 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the ratio during 2002 was primarily the result of realized investment losses in the Companys insurance subsidiaries. Unlike GAAP, statutory accounting does not generally require unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities to be reflected in surplus. Because unrealized losses are not recognized in statutory surplus, the recognition of an impairment write down or a realized loss on the sale of a security decreases the statutory surplus of the Companys insurance subsidiaries and therefore decreases the RBC ratios. The individual RBC ratios for the Companys principal operating subsidiaries ranged from 193 percent to 262 percent at December 31, 2002. Although the individual RBC ratio for each insurance subsidiary continues to be above the range that would require state regulatory action, the Company is reviewing various alternatives to restore the RBC ratios for its insurance subsidiaries to the approximate level of 2001. At December 31, 2002, the Company had short term and long term debt totaling $255.0 million and $1,914.0 million, respectively. The debt to total capital ratio was 29.5 percent at December 31, 2002 compared to 29.8 percent and 30.2 percent at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The debt to total capital ratio, when calculated allowing 50 percent equity credit for the Companys company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debt securities of the Company, was 27.7 percent at December 31, 2002 compared to 28.0 percent and 27.1 percent at December 31, 2001 and 2000. During 2000, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a shelf registration on Form S 3 covering the issuance of up to $1.0 billion of securities in order to provide funding alternatives for its maturing debt. In the first quarter of 2001, the Company completed a long term debt offering, issuing $575.0 million of 7.625% senior notes due March 1, 2011. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed two long term offerings, issuing $250.0 million of 7.375% senior debentures due June 15, 2032 and $150.0 million of 7.250% public income notes due June 15, 2032. The public income notes are redeemable at the Companys option, in whole or in part, on or after June 25, 2007. Proceeds from the offerings were used to refinance existing commercial paper borrowings. On November 1, 2002, the Company filed with the SEC a shelf registration on Form S 3. When declared effective by the SEC, the shelf registration statement will allow the Company to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase contracts, units and warrants, or preferred securities of wholly owned finance trusts, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion. The shelf registration will enable the Company to raise funds from the offering of any individual security covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof, subject to market conditions and the Companys capital needs. During 2001 the Company redeemed its $172.5 million par value 8.8% monthly income debt securities (junior subordinated debt), which were due in 2025 but callable at par in 2000 and thereafter. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a fourth quarter of 2001 write off of the remaining deferred debt cost of $4.5 million associated with the issuance of the securities. The extraordinary loss, net of a $1.6 million tax benefit, was $2.9 million. During 2000, the Company entered into $1.0 billion senior revolving credit facilities with a group of banks. The facilities are split into five year revolver and 364 day portions. The Company received a 90 day extension on the 364 day portion of the credit facilities which was to expire on October 29, 2002. In connection with that extension, the Company elected to reduce the size of the credit facilities from $1.0 billion to $750.0 million and reduce the size of the commercial paper program to $750.0 million. At December 31, 2002, approximately $750.0 million was available for additional financing under the Companys revolving credit facilities. On January 27, 2003, the Company elected not to renew the 364 day portion of the credit facilities upon the expiration date for the 90 day extension, retaining only the $472.5 million five year revolver portion. The Companys commercial paper program has been similarly reduced in size to $472.5 million. The credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes, including support of the Companys $472.5 million commercial paper program, and contain certain covenants that, among other provisions, include a minimum tangible net worth requirement, a maximum leverage ratio restriction, and a limitation on debt relative to the consolidated statutory earnings of the Companys insurance subsidiaries. The Company has been in compliance with all 53 Table of Contents covenants of the credit facilities since their inception, with the exception of the limitation on debt relative to the consolidated statutory earnings of the Companys insurance subsidiaries, for which it received a waiver for the first, second, and fourth quarters of 2002 due to non compliance. The Companys statutory earnings improved during the second quarter and returned to historical levels in the third quarter of 2002, but the covenant stipulates that the most recent twelve month period be used for the statutory earnings test. On August 13, 2002, in connection with the waiver received for the second quarter, the credit facilities were amended to reflect adjusted required levels of consolidated statutory earnings in the calculation of this covenant through 2002 and adjusted required levels of the ratio of senior debt to consolidated statutory earnings through 2003. On March 4, 2003, the Company received a waiver for the limitation on debt relative to the consolidated statutory earnings of the Companys insurance subsidiaries for the fourth quarter of 2002 to allow for the reporting effects of an intercompany reinsurance transaction. During 2000, the Company issued $200.0 million of variable rate notes in a privately negotiated transaction. The notes were used to refinance other short term debt and had a weighted average interest rate of 7.52 percent during the first quarter of 2001. The notes matured in April 2001. During the second quarter of 2002, the Companys board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $100.0 million over the next year at prices not to exceed market value. The stock purchases will be used in connection with the Companys benefit and compensation plans and for other corporate purposes and can be made through the open market or privately negotiated transactions. Under this program, the Company acquired approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock in the open market during the second quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $45.0 million. It is not anticipated that further repurchases will be made under the program. In 1998, the Company completed a public offering of $200.0 million of 7.25% senior notes due March 15, 2028. In 1998, Provident Financing Trust I, a wholly owned subsidiary trust of the Company, issued $300.0 million of 7.405% capital securities in a public offering. These capital securities, which mature on March 15, 2038, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, have a liquidation value of $1,000 per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances. The Company issued $300.0 million of 7.405% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, which mature on March 15, 2038, to the subsidiary trust in connection with the capital securities offering. The sole assets of the subsidiary trust are the junior subordinated debt securities. In 1998, the Company completed a public offering of $200.0 million of 6.375% senior notes due July 15, 2005, and $200.0 million of 7.0% senior notes due July 15, 2018. In December 1998, the Company issued $250.0 million of 6.75% senior notes, which mature in 2028. Contractual debt, Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities commitments, and lease commitments are as follows (in millions of dollars): Payments Due Total In 1 Year or Less After 1 Year up to 3 Years After 3 Years up to 5 Years After 5 Years Short term Debt $ 255.0 $ 255.0 $ $ $ Long term Debt 1,914.0 227.0 1,687.0 Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities 300.0 300.0 Operating Leases 131.4 32.5 52.4 30.8 15.7 Total $ 2,600.4 $ 287.5 $ 279.4 $ 30.8 $ 2,002.7 54 Table of Contents The Company has an agreement with an outside party wherein the Company is provided computer data processing services and related functions. The contract expires in 2010, but the Company may cancel this agreement effective August 2004 or later upon payment of applicable cancellation charges. The aggregate noncancelable contractual obligation remaining under this agreement, as amended, was $158.8 million at December 31, 2002, with no annual payment expected to exceed $58.3 million. As previously discussed, at December 31, 2002, the Company had capital commitments of $14.1 million to fund a special purpose entity trust in which the Company has a retained interest. The Company also has capital commitments of $18.8 million to fund certain of its private placement fixed maturity securities. The funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from the trustee or issuer. These amounts may or may not be funded during the term of the security. The Company is exploring various options to improve its capital and risk positions, including but not limited to financing alternatives and various reinsurance opportunities. These actions may result in lower net income or lower net income per common share for the Company in future periods. Ratings Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P), Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), Fitch, Inc. (Fitch), and A.M. Best Company (AM Best) are among the third parties that provide the Company assessments of its overall financial position. Ratings from these agencies for financial strength are available for the individual U.S. domiciled insurance company subsidiaries. Financial strength ratings are based primarily on U.S. statutory financial information for the individual U.S. domiciled insurance companies. Debt ratings for the Company are based primarily on consolidated financial information prepared using generally accepted accounting principles. Both financial strength ratings and debt ratings incorporate qualitative analyses by rating agencies on an ongoing basis. If the Company were to experience negative operating trends, it could result in a downgrade of the current ratings, which might affect the Companys ability to sell and retain its business. In the fourth quarter of 2002 and subsequently, the rating agencies have downgraded the senior debt ratings of the Company and the financial strength ratings of the Companys insurance subsidiaries. Currently, each of the rating agencies have the financial strength and senior debt ratings under review with negative implications. The table below reflects the debt ratings, as of the date of this filing, for the Company and the financial strength ratings for the U.S. domiciled insurance company subsidiaries.

Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Other Information Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains separate U.S. and foreign pension plans and a U.S. post retirement benefit plan. The U.S. pension plans comprise the majority of the total benefit obligation and pension expense for the company. The value of the benefit obligations is determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent the Companys best estimate of future expected experience. These assumptions are reviewed annually. Two of the economic assumptions are adjusted accordingly based on key external indices, the discount rate, and the long term rate of return assumption. The assumptions are consistent for both the U.S. pension plans and the U.S. post retirement benefit plan. The Company follows Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106) in its financial reporting and accounting for its pension and post retirement benefit plans. The discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value. The discount rate was determined based on a review of long term fixed income securities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. In setting the assumption, the Company also has considered the change in the level of interest rates on these securities since the prior year end and the duration of the fixed income indices relative to the duration of the plans liabilities. Historically, the Company has used the Moodys Aa corporate bond index as one of the primary benchmarks in selecting a discount rate. As of December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, this index was 6.52 percent, 7.08 percent, and 7.41 percent, respectively. The Company has estimated that the duration of the index is approximately 11 to 12 years. The majority of the obligations in the U.S. pension plans, however, are related to active and deferred vested employees, and duration, therefore, is significantly longer, at approximately 23 years. The Company therefore adjusted the Moodys index upward by approximately 25 basis points to arrive at the discount rate assumption of 6.75 percent, 7.35 percent, and 7.60 percent as of December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Between December 31, 2001 and 2002, the Moodys Aa corporate bond index dropped by 56 basis points (from 7.08 percent to 6.52 percent). The decline in other Moodys Aa indices (e.g., industrials and utilities) was comparable. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that the 60 basis point decline in the SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 discount rate, from 7.35 percent on December 31, 2001 to 6.75 percent on December 31, 2002, was reasonable. Lowering the discount rate by 0.5 percent would have increased the 2002 pension expense for the U.S. pension plans by $4.1 million and would be expected to result in an $8.5 million increase in the 2003 pension plan expense. The long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid. For 2003, 2002, and 2001, the long term return on asset assumption for the U.S. pension plans is 8.50 percent, 9.00 percent, and 9.00 percent, respectively. The determination of the best estimate is based on a building block approach. This methodology examines the various elements of the expected return for each asset class, such as inflation, dividends, real return, and risk premium. The expected return for each asset class is calculated as the sum of the individual components. The total expected return for the portfolio equals the weighted average of the return for each asset class, based on the plans asset allocation. The expected long term rate of return assumption for the U.S. pension plans in 2002 is 9.00 percent. This assumption is based on an average expected return of about 6.00 percent annually for fixed income investments and 10.00 percent annually for equities. Based on the target asset allocation of 75 percent equities and 25 percent fixed income securities, this equates to a weighted average return of 9.00 percent. The Companys expectations for future investment returns in the plans are based on a combination of historical market performance and the Companys evaluations of investment forecasts prepared by outside consultants and economists. Since 1926, the average real return (before inflation) has been about 8.00 percent for equities and 2.5 percent for bonds. The Company has not relied extensively on the historical market performance of the U.S. pension plans in setting the expected long term rate of return assumption. This is because the current plan is composed of three plans that were merged to create one plan in 2000. Furthermore, in 2000, annuities were purchased for all existing retirees. Due to the nature of these changes, the historical performance of these plans is not a reliable indicator of future expected performance. In calculating the average return over the lifetime of the plan, the duration of the projected benefit obligation, at approximately 23 years, also has been considered, as well as the effect of active management of the plans assets. 56 Table of Contents For 2003, the expected long term rate of return assumption will be lowered to 8.50 percent, reflecting lower average expected returns for equities of about 9.25 percent annually. For the U.S. pension plans, the target asset allocation is 75 percent equities and 25 percent fixed income securities, and the actual asset allocation at December 31, 2002 was 73 percent equities and 27 percent fixed income securities. The equity securities are concentrated in large cap investments and subject to the investment return volatility experienced in the S&P 500. The Company uses a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on pension plan assets. The Company intends to review its pension investment policy during the first half of 2003 and will be rebalancing the asset mix following that review. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by 0.5 percent would have increased the 2002 pension expense by approximately $2.3 million. For 2003, lowering the assumption by 0.5 percent would increase pension expense by approximately $1.8 million. The market related value equals the fair value of assets, determined as of the measurement date. The assets are not smoothed for purposes of SFAS 87. The expected return on assets, therefore, fully recognizes all asset gains and losses through the measurement date. The Company holds an unrecognized net gain or loss representing cumulative liability and asset gains and losses that have not been recognized in pension expense. As of December 31, 2002, there was an estimated unrecognized loss of approximately $320.0 million in the U.S. Pension plans. As of December 31, 2001, the unrecognized loss was $38.0 million, and as of December 31, 2000, there was a $99.0 million unrecognized gain. The unrecognized loss has increased due to asset market value losses that occurred during 2001 and 2002 and the drop in the year end discount rate from 7.60 percent at 2000, to 7.35 percent at 2001, and to 6.75 percent at 2002. The unrecognized net gain or loss is amortized in the pension expense. Only amounts outside of a corridor (equal to 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market value of assets) are amortized. The 2003 pension expense is expected to include a loss amortization of approximately $20.0 million. This loss amortization was less than $1.0 million in 2002. In 2001 and 2000, the pension expense included gain amortization of $4.0 million and $21.0 million, respectively. The U.S. Pension plans experienced a negative pension expense in 2002, 2001, and 2000 that has increased before tax income in the amount of $2.6 million, $17.7 million, and $164.1 million, respectively. Approximately $116.1 million of the negative pension expense in 2000 is due to a single premium annuity purchase to fund the Companys retirement benefit obligation for approximately 3,000 retirees. The end of the year value of the assets in the U.S. Pension plans has declined from $515.0 million in 2000, to $458.0 million in 2001, and to $350.0 million in 2002. The decrease in assets, coupled with the liability increase due to declining discount rates, has reduced the year end funding level in the plan from a surplus of $246.0 million in 2000, to a surplus of $139.0 million in 2001, and to a deficit of $114.0 million as of December 31, 2002. The Company contributes to the U.S. Pension plans in accordance with the minimum funding requirements of ERISA. The Company was not required to make a minimum required contribution in 2002, nor will it be required to make a contribution in 2003. Based on projections performed by the Companys actuaries, it is anticipated that contributions may not be required in 2004, but will be required in 2005 and or 2006. The Company may decide to contribute an amount above the minimum required amount. Recent Events In late March 2003, the Companys Board of Directors replaced J. Harold Chandler as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Pursuant to the employment contract between the Company and Mr. Chandler dating from 1999, Mr. Chandler will receive severance and pension benefits which is expected to reduce the Companys first quarter of 2003 net income by approximately $9.8 million. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The following discussion regarding the Companys risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur (sensitivity analysis). Caution should be used in evaluating the Companys overall market risk from the information presented below, as actual results may differ. The Company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks. See Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk, including derivative financial instrument activity. Interest Rate Risk The operations of the Company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations, primarily long term U.S. interest rates. Changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows. Management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes. This analysis is the precursor to the Companys activities in derivative financial instruments. The Company uses interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, exchange traded interest rate futures contracts, and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities. Assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels, the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be $1.0 billion and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The fair values of mortgage loans, which are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost, would decrease by approximately $30 million and $50 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, assuming a 100 basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels, the fair values of the Companys long term debt would increase approximately $150 million and $125 million, respectively, and the fair values of the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities would increase approximately $25 million and $40 million, respectively. The effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a matrix pricing system whereby all securities were priced with the resulting market rates and spreads assuming a change of 100 basis points. These hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value. The changes in the fair values of long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were determined using discounted cash flows analyses. Because the Company actively manages its investments and liabilities, actual changes could be less than those estimated above. Foreign Currency Risk The Company is also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its foreign operations and certain investment securities denominated in those local currencies. Foreign operations represented 7.6 percent and 7.4 percent of total assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and 8.6 percent and 8.7 percent of total revenue for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Assuming foreign exchange rates decreased 10 percent from the December 31, 2002 and 2001 levels, year end 2002 and 2001 stockholders equity would not be materially affected. 58 Table of Contents
