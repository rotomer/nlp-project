ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, and other information included in this Form 10 K. As stated in Item 1, Union Pacific Corporation consists of two reportable segments, rail and trucking, as well as UPCs other product lines (Other). The rail segment includes the operations of UPRR and UPRRs subsidiaries and rail affiliates (collectively, the Railroad). The trucking segment includes the operations of Overnite and, subsequent to November 30, 2001, Motor Cargo. The Corporations other product lines are comprised of the corporate holding company (which largely supports the Railroad), Fenix LLC and affiliated technology companies (Fenix), self insurance activities, and all appropriate consolidating entries (see note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME The Corporation reported record net income of $966 million ($3.90 per basic share and $3.77 per diluted share) in 2001 compared to $842 million ($3.42 per basic share and $3.34 per diluted share) in 2000. Excluding the effect of a $115 million pre tax ($72 million after tax) charge in 2000 related to a work force reduction plan at the Railroad, 2000 net income was $914 million ($3.71 per basic share and $3.61 per diluted share). The increase in net income excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000 was due primarily to revenue growth, productivity gains and cost control, lower non operating expense and lower fuel prices. OPERATING REVENUES Operating revenues increased $95 million (1%) to a record $12.0 billion in 2001, reflecting 1% growth at the Railroad and 3% growth in the trucking segment. The Corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. Other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. 13 OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased $74 million (1%) to $9.9 billion in 2001 from $10.0 billion in 2000. Excluding the effect of the work force reduction charge in 2000, operating expenses increased $41 million compared to 2000 reflecting wage and benefit inflation and higher equipment rents and depreciation expenses. These increases were partially offset by a 4% reduction in employment levels at the Railroad, lower fuel prices and cost control efforts. Lower fuel prices in 2001 versus 2000 reduced fuel expense by $35 million in 2001. Salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased $35 million compared to 2000. Excluding the work force reduction charge, salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $80 million (2%), as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity. Equipment and other rents expense increased $26 million (2%) as a result of additional locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times, which indicates that cars spent more time on the rail system between shipments. Partially offsetting these increases were lower costs due to declines in rail traffic requiring rental of freight cars. In addition, the Railroad experienced lower rental rates, and Overnite experienced lower contract transportation costs. Depreciation expense increased $34 million (3%) as a result of the Railroads capital spending in recent years which increased the total value of the Corporations assets subject to depreciation (see note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Fuel and utilities costs were down $34 million (3%) compared to 2000 due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption rate, partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the Railroad and losses on fuel hedging activity (see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Materials and supplies expense decreased $56 million (9%) primarily due to reduced locomotive repairs and cost control actions. Casualty costs increased $16 million (4%) over 2000 due to higher insurance, bad debts and environmental expenses. Other costs decreased $25 million (3%) as productivity and cost control efforts more than offset higher state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased $169 million (9%) to $2.1 billion in 2001. Excluding the effect of the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, 2001 operating income increased $54 million (3%) as revenue growth, productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation, increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume. NON OPERATING ITEMS Interest expense decreased $22 million (3%) compared to 2000 due to lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in 2001. In 2001, the Corporations weighted average debt level decreased from $10,044 million in 2000 to $9,980 million in 2001. The Corporations weighted average interest rate was 7.0% in 2001 as compared to 7.2% in 2000. Other income increased $32 million (25%) in 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to higher real estate sales. Income tax expense increased $99 million (21%) in 2001 over 2000. Excluding the effect of the $115 million work force reduction charge on income tax expense in 2000, income taxes for 2001 increased $56 million (11%) over 2000. The increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in 2001 and an increase in the effective tax rate from 35.7% in 2000 to 37.0% in 2001. KEY MEASURES Net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 8.1% in 2001 from 7.1% in 2000. Net income as a percentage of operating revenues in 2000, excluding the work force reduction charge, was 7.7%. Return on average common shareholders equity was 10.6% in 2001, up from 10.1% in 2000. Excluding the charge in 2000, return on average common shareholders equity was 10.9% in 2000. The Corporations operating ratio was 82.7% in 2001 compared to 84.0% in 2000 and 83.0% in 2000, excluding the work force reduction charge. RAIL SEGMENT NET INCOME Rail operations reported record net income of $1.1 billion in 2001 compared to net income of $926 million in 2000, up 14%. Excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000, net income was $998 million. The increase in earnings resulted from higher commodity revenue and real estate sales combined with lower fuel expense, interest expense and materials and supplies expense. These improvements were partially offset by inflation, lower other revenue and higher equipment rent and depreciation expenses. OPERATING REVENUES Rail operating revenues increased $69 million (1%) over 2000 to a record $10.8 billion. Revenue carloads were flat with an increase in the energy and agricultural commodity groups offset by decreases in the other four commodity groups. The decrease in other revenue was the result of lower switching, subsidiary and accessorial revenues. 14 The following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue, revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type: Commodity Revenue in Millions of Dollars 2001 2000 Change Agricultural ............................. $ 1,452 $ 1,400 4% Automotive ............................... 1,118 1,182 (5) Chemicals ................................ 1,547 1,640 (6) Energy ................................... 2,399 2,154 11 Industrial Products ...................... 1,970 1,985 (1) Intermodal ............................... 1,905 1,909 Total .................................... $ 10,391 $ 10,270 1% Revenue Carloads in Thousands 2001 2000 Change Agricultural ............................. 875 873 % Automotive ............................... 763 815 (6) Chemicals ................................ 880 936 (6) Energy ................................... 2,161 1,930 12 Industrial Products ...................... 1,405 1,431 (2) Intermodal ............................... 2,832 2,916 (3) Total .................................... 8,916 8,901 % Average Revenue Per Car 2001 2000 Change Agricultural ............................. $ 1,659 $ 1,604 3% Automotive ............................... 1,465 1,450 1 Chemicals ................................ 1,757 1,752 Energy ................................... 1,111 1,116 Industrial Products ...................... 1,402 1,387 1 Intermodal ............................... 673 655 3 Total .................................... $ 1,165 $ 1,154 1% Agricultural Revenue increased 4%, due primarily to a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Carloads were flat, as higher corn shipments and meals and oils exports were offset by a decrease in demand for domestic and export wheat shipments and a poor sugar beet harvest. Revenue gains were also achieved through increased beer imports from Mexico, wine shipments from California to eastern markets, express service of fresh and frozen products and increased demand for cottonseed. Average revenue per car increased due to a longer average length of haul, resulting from fewer short haul wheat and sweetener shipments combined with increased long haul domestic and Mexico corn shipments. Automotive Revenue declined 5% as a result of a 6% decrease in carloads and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Materials volumes declined 16%, as the soft economy and a decline in vehicle sales led to high inventories, low industry production and auto plant shutdowns. Total finished vehicle shipments declined only 1%, as industry weakness was mitigated by market share gains. Consumer incentives in the fourth quarter stimulated vehicle sales and helped offset weakness early in the year. Average revenue per car increased due to a shift in mix of materials shipped, resulting from fewer shipments of materials with lower average revenue per car. Additionally, more materials were shipped in boxcars rather than containers, which yield higher average revenue per car than containers. Chemicals Revenue declined 6%, due to a 6% decrease in carloads. Volume declines were the result of the soft economy, as reduced demand for consumer durables led to high manufacturer inventories and weak demand for plastics. Reduced industrial manufacturing also depressed demand for liquid and dry chemicals. Fertilizer and phosphate rock revenues decreased as high energy costs early in the year reduced the market for these commodities. Average revenue per car was flat, as the positive impact of fewer low average revenue per car phosphate rock shipments was offset by a decrease in average revenue per car for soda ash shipments. Energy Energy commodity revenue increased 11% compared to 2000, due to a 12% increase in carloads. Records were set in 2001 for total carloads, revenue and coal trains loaded per day in the Southern Powder River Basin in Wyoming 15 and in the coal mining regions of Colorado and Utah. These increases were driven by strong utility demand caused by severe winter weather in late 2000 and the first quarter of 2001. In the first half of the year, demand for coal also increased due to the high cost of alternative fuels, such as natural gas, fuel oil and higher priced eastern sourced coal. Carloads also increased due to gains in market share. Industrial Products Revenue decreased 1%, as a 2% decline in carloads was partially offset by a 1% increase in average revenue per car. The decline was mainly the result of the economic slowdown, which had a negative effect on many economically sensitive commodities including steel and paper markets. Steel producers were additionally impacted by high levels of low cost imported steel, which forced plant shutdowns and bankruptcies. Newsprint and fiber revenue declined due to lack of demand for printed advertising. Partially offsetting these declines were increases in construction related commodities, led by stone and cement, as strong building and road construction activity continued in the South and Southwestern regions of the country. Lumber volumes increased due to strong housing construction and uncertainty surrounding restrictions on Canadian lumber imports. Average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul business. These gains were partially offset by the impact of increased shipments of stone, which generates lower average revenue per car. Intermodal Revenue was flat, as a 3% decline in carloads was offset by a 3% increase in average revenue per car. The volume decrease was primarily the result of soft economic demand for domestic shipments. In addition, the voluntary action of shedding low margin trailer business in favor of higher margin containers contributed to the decline. Partially offsetting the domestic declines were increases in international shipments, the result of higher import demand. The increase in average revenue per car was primarily the result of price increases. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased $109 million (1%) to $8.7 billion in 2001. Excluding the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, operating expenses were essentially flat. Higher expenses as a result of inflation, higher equipment rents expense and depreciation were offset by savings from lower force levels, productivity gains and cost control efforts and lower fuel prices. Salaries, Wages and Employee Benefits Salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased $83 million (2%) in 2001 to $3.5 billion. Excluding the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, salaries, wages and employee benefits expense increased $32 million (1%). The primary driver of the increase was wage and employee benefits inflation. A 3% gross ton mile increase also added volume costs. A 4% reduction in employee force levels as a result of the work force reduction plan offset a significant portion of these higher costs. Equipment and Other Rents Expenses increased $32 million (3%) compared to 2000 due primarily to higher locomotive leases and longer car cycle times. The higher locomotive lease expense is due to the Railroads increased leasing of new, more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives. These new locomotives replaced older, non leased models in the fleet, which helped reduce expenses for depreciation, labor, materials and fuel during the year. The increase in car cycle times is partially attributable to a decline in automotive shipments earlier in the year, which resulted in excess freight cars being stored at assembly plants and unloading facilities. Partially offsetting the increases in expenses were lower volume costs, lower car leases and lower prices for equipment. The decrease in volume costs was attributable to a decline in carloads in business segments such as industrial products and intermodal that utilize a high percentage of rented freight cars. Depreciation Depreciation expense increased $31 million (3%) over 2000, resulting from capital spending in recent years. Capital spending totaled $1.7 billion in 2001 and in 2000 and $1.8 billion in 1999. Fuel and Utilities Expenses decreased $30 million (2%). The decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate, as measured by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles. Fuel prices averaged 88 cents per gallon in 2001 compared to 90 cents per gallon in 2000, including taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of 17 cents and 13 cents in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Railroad hedged approximately 32% of its fuel consumption for the year, which increased fuel costs by $20 million. As of December 31, 2001, expected fuel consumption for 2002 is 44% hedged at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and for 2003 is 5% hedged at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads (see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). 16 Materials and Supplies Expenses decreased $71 million (13%), reflecting locomotive overhaul reductions and productivity improvements and cost control measures. Locomotive overhauls decreased due to acquisition of new, more reliable locomotives during the year and the sale of older units, which required higher maintenance. Materials and supplies expenses related to car maintenance also declined due to lower business levels in the industrial products and automotive commodity groups. The cars utilized in these commodity groups normally require more maintenance than the cars utilized within the other commodity groups. Casualty Costs Costs increased $9 million (3%) compared to 2000, as higher insurance, bad debt and environmental expenses were partially offset by lower personal injury costs and lower costs for damaged freight cars. Other Costs Expenses increased $3 million (flat) compared to 2000 primarily due to higher state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased $178 million (9%) to $2.1 billion. Excluding the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, operating income increased $63 million (3%) in 2001. The operating ratio for 2001 was 80.7%, compared to 82.3% in 2000. Excluding the work force reduction charge, the operating ratio for 2000 was 81.2%. NON OPERATING ITEMS Non operating expense decreased $56 million (12%) compared to 2000. Real estate sales and net other income increased $48 million (38%). Interest expense decreased $8 million (1%) as a result of lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in 2001. Income taxes increased $102 million (20%) in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000, income tax expense increased $59 million (11%). The increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in 2001 and an increase in the effective tax rate from 35.6% in 2000 to 36.7% in 2001. TRUCKING SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES In 2001, trucking revenues rose $30 million (3%) to $1,143 million. The growth resulted from rate increases, new services and $10 million in incremental revenue due to the acquisition of Motor Cargo. Tonnage for the year was flat compared to 2000. OPERATING EXPENSES Trucking operating expenses rose $29 million (3%) to $1,089 million in 2001. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $40 million (6%) due to a 4% increase in employees as well as wage and benefit inflation and enhancements. Fuel and utilities costs decreased $5 million (7%), as a result of lower fuel prices during the year (82 cents per gallon average in 2001 compared to 90 cents per gallon average in 2000, including transportation costs and regional pricing spreads, and excluding taxes), partially offset by a 1% increase in gallons consumed. Overnite did not hedge any fuel volume for the year ended December 31, 2001. However, as of December 31, 2001, Overnite had hedged approximately 16% of its expected fuel consumption for 2002 at an average of 58 cents per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and had hedged approximately 5% of its expected fuel consumption for 2003 at an average of 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. Equipment and other rents decreased $4 million (4%) due to decreased use of contract transportation during the year. High utilization of contract transportation in 2000 was necessary due to Teamsters related work stoppage. Casualty costs increased $7 million (18%) due to higher bad debt, insurance and cargo loss and damage expenses. Other costs decreased $11 million (10%) due to lower expenses related to decreased security (related to Teamsters matters), legal and employee travel expenses in 2001. OPERATING INCOME Trucking operations generated operating income of $54 million in 2001, compared to $53 million for 2000. The operating ratio increased to 95.3%, compared to 95.2% in 2000. OTHER PRODUCT LINES OTHER Operating losses increased $10 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Operating revenues declined $4 million year over year. Operating expenses increased $6 million due to increased spending at Fenix to develop new products and services. 17 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME The Corporation reported net income of $842 million ($3.42 per basic share and $3.34 per diluted share) in 2000. Excluding the effect of the $115 million pre tax ($72 million after tax) charge related to a work force reduction plan at the Railroad, net income grew to $914 million ($3.71 per basic share and $3.61 per diluted share) in 2000 compared to $810 million ($3.28 per basic share and $3.22 per diluted share) in 1999. The increase in net income was due primarily to revenue growth, improved service levels and productivity improvements at the Railroad, partially offset by significantly higher fuel prices. Net income for 1999 included a one time after tax gain of $27 million ($0.11 per basic share and $0.10 per diluted share) from the adjustment of a liability established in connection with the discontinued operations of a former subsidiary (see note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). OPERATING REVENUES Operating revenues increased $641 million (6%) to $11.9 billion in 2000, reflecting higher volumes in five of the six commodity groups at the Railroad, higher other revenue at the Railroad and a 5% increase in revenue at Overnite. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses increased to $10.0 billion (6%) in 2000 from $9.4 billion in 1999, reflecting the work force reduction charge, higher fuel prices, inflation, volume related costs from a 4% increase in carloads at the Railroad and increased depreciation expense. The increase in fuel prices added $464 million to operating expenses in 2000 compared to 1999. Productivity improvements and other cost control measures partially offset the increase in operating expenses. Excluding the $115 million pre tax work force reduction charge, operating expenses increased $427 million (5%) to $9.9 billion. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $26 million (1%) compared to 1999. Salaries, wages and employee benefits declined $89 million (2%), excluding the work force reduction charge, as lower employment levels and improved productivity at the Railroad more than offset higher rail volume and inflation. Equipment and other rents expense decreased $16 million (1%) as improved car cycle times and lower rental rates more than offset increased Railroad volume and higher contract transportation costs at Overnite. Depreciation expense increased $57 million (5%) as a result of the Railroads capital spending in recent years. Fuel and utilities costs were $518 million (62%) higher than 1999 resulting from significantly higher fuel prices and increased carloads, partially offset by favorable fuel hedging (see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Materials and supplies expense increased $3 million (1%) primarily due to volume related increases in car and locomotive repairs, partially offset by productivity and cost control actions. Casualty costs decreased $18 million (5%) over 1999 as a result of lower settlement costs at the Railroad. Other costs decreased $28 million (3%) as productivity and cost control efforts more than offset volume related costs and higher state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased to $1.9 billion in 2000 from $1.8 billion in 1999, as revenue growth and productivity gains at the Railroad more than offset higher fuel prices, rail volume costs and increased depreciation expense. Excluding the $115 million pre tax work force reduction charge, operating income increased $214 million (12%) to $2.0 billion. NON OPERATING ITEMS Interest expense decreased $10 million (1%) compared to 1999 primarily due to lower average debt levels in 2000. Excluding the income tax expense associated with the work force reduction charge, income taxes for 2000 increased $92 million (22%) over 1999 as a result of higher income levels in 2000 and settlements in 1999 related to prior tax years. KEY MEASURES Net income as a percentage of operating revenues declined to 7.1% in 2000 from 7.2% in 1999. Net income as a percentage of operating revenues excluding the work force reduction charge improved to 7.7% in 2000. In 2000, return on average common shareholders equity was 10.1%. Excluding the work force reduction charge, in 2000, return on average common shareholders equity was 10.9%, up from 10.5% in 1999, reflecting strong revenue growth and improved operations at the Railroad and Overnite. The Corporations operating ratio was 84.0% in 2000. Excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000, it was 83.0% compared to 83.9% in 1999. 18 RAIL SEGMENT NET INCOME Rail operations reported record net income of $926 million in 2000 compared to net income of $854 million in 1999. The increase in income resulted primarily from higher commodity and other revenue, improved operations, productivity gains and lower interest expense, partially offset by significantly higher fuel prices and volume related costs. Excluding the work force reduction charge, net income was $998 million in 2000. OPERATING REVENUES Rail operating revenues increased $591 million (6%) over 1999 to a record $10.7 billion. Revenue carloads increased 4% over 1999 with gains in five of the six commodity groups. Other revenue gains were the result of higher subsidiary revenues and increased accessorial services. The following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue, revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type: Commodity Revenue in Millions of Dollars 2000 1999 Change Agricultural ........................... $ 1,400 $ 1,419 (1)% Automotive ............................. 1,182 1,048 13 Chemicals .............................. 1,640 1,595 3 Energy ................................. 2,154 2,168 (1) Industrial Products .................... 1,985 1,896 5 Intermodal ............................. 1,909 1,725 11 Total .................................. $ 10,270 $ 9,851 4% Revenue Carloads in Thousands 2000 1999 Change Agricultural ........................... 873 911 (4)% Automotive ............................. 815 707 15 Chemicals .............................. 936 930 1 Energy ................................. 1,930 1,872 3 Industrial Products .................... 1,431 1,398 2 Intermodal ............................. 2,916 2,738 7 Total .................................. 8,901 8,556 4% Average Revenue Per Car 2000 1999 Change Agricultural ........................... $ 1,604 $ 1,558 3% Automotive ............................. 1,450 1,481 (2) Chemicals .............................. 1,752 1,715 2 Energy ................................. 1,116 1,158 (4) Industrial Products .................... 1,387 1,357 2 Intermodal ............................. 655 630 4 Total .................................. $ 1,154 $ 1,151 % Agricultural Revenue declined 1%, as a 4% decrease in carloads more than offset a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Carloads decreased primarily due to reduced export demand for wheat and corn and a lack of producer selling in anticipation of higher prices. Revenue increased for fresh fruits and vegetables primarily as a result of new express train service from the Pacific Northwest and northern California to eastern markets. Beverage revenue increased due to new wine shipments out of California and higher domestic beer carloads. Average revenue per car increased primarily due to an increase in longer haul traffic, particularly domestic corn shuttle shipments to California. Automotive Revenue increased 13% as a result of a 15% increase in carloads. Both revenue and carload totals were all time records, resulting from strong demand for finished vehicles and parts, market share gains and improved rail service. Business volume with Mexico was particularly strong due to increased vehicle production levels and more reliable and expanded rail service. New service offerings facilitated the conversion of automotive parts shipments from truck to the Railroad. Increased container shipments of automotive parts, rather than boxcar shipments, caused average revenue per car to decrease slightly. 19 Chemicals A 1% increase in carloads combined with a 2% increase in average revenue per car led to a 3% increase in revenue. Revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in average revenue per car for soda ash, fertilizer, and liquid and dry commodities due to selected price increases. Year over year carload improvements came mainly in the first half of the year, as a strong economy and customer plant expansions led to increased market demand for plastics, liquid and dry chemicals and domestic soda ash. However, a softening economy late in the year resulted in a 2% decline in fourth quarter revenue compared to 1999, with weakness in most areas of the chemical market. Energy Energy revenue was down 1% compared to 1999, despite a 3% increase in carloads for the year. Average revenue per car dropped 4% as a result of contract pricing provisions with certain major customers. In the first six months of 2000, carloads declined compared to 1999 due to lower coal demand at utilities resulting from high inventories caused by mild winter weather and Year 2000 stockpiles. In the second half of 2000, carloads increased over 1999 levels due to hot summer weather and the combination of cold winter weather late in the year and a significant increase in the price of alternative fuels. Delays due to severe winter weather partially offset volume gains in the second half of the year. Industrial Products Revenue increased 5% on a 2% increase in carloads and a 2% increase in average revenue per car. A strong economy in the first half of 2000 led to a general increase in demand for most business lines. The largest revenue gains were in steel, lumber, cement and other building materials due to an expanding construction market, especially in the south and southwest. New rail services and generally improved service performance also contributed to the increase in carloads. Starting in the third quarter, a softening in the economy began to adversely affect business demand. Fourth quarter revenue and carloads decreased in nearly all business lines but especially minerals, steel and hazardous waste. The increase in average revenue per car was due to gains in higher average revenue per car, steel and lumber carloads and selected price increases during the year. Intermodal Revenue increased 11% due to a 7% increase in carloads and a 4% increase in average revenue per car. Carload growth resulted from a strong U.S. economy in the first half of 2000 and increased demand for imports from Asia. Improved service performance led to an increase in carloads and revenue for expedited premium service. New and expanded rail service offerings also contributed to the gains. The increase in average revenue per car was primarily the result of price increases and a longer average length of haul in some markets. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expense increased $510 million (6%) to $8.8 billion in 2000. The higher expenses are primarily the result of significantly higher fuel prices, inflation, volume costs associated with a 4% increase in carloads and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by productivity gains and other cost control measures. Operating expenses increased $395 million (5%) to $8.7 billion in 2000, excluding the $115 million pre tax charge for the work force reduction plan. Salaries, Wages and Employee Benefits Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $19 million (1%) to $3.6 billion. Costs decreased $96 million (3%), excluding the $115 million pre tax work force reduction charge. The primary driver was productivity improvements that resulted in lower train crew expenses despite a 4% increase in carload volume. In addition, the average employee count decreased 4% from 1999 to 2000. Partially offsetting these gains were increased costs due to greater rail volume and wage and employee benefit inflation. Equipment and Other Rents Expenses decreased $20 million (2%) compared to 1999. The improvement was attributable to lower prices for equipment and improvements in car cycle times, partially offset by higher volume related costs. Depreciation Depreciation expense increased $55 million (5%) over 1999, resulting from capital spending in recent years. Capital spending totaled $1.7 billion in 2000 compared to $1.8 billion in 1999 and $2.0 billion in 1998. Fuel and Utilities Expenses increased $496 million (63%). The increase was driven by significantly higher fuel prices (which added $444 million of additional costs) and higher volume. Fuel prices averaged 90 cents per gallon in 2000 compared to 56 cents per gallon in 1999, including taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of 13 cents for each of the years. The Railroad hedged approximately 10% of its fuel consumption for the year, which decreased fuel costs by $52 million. As of December 31, 2000, expected fuel consumption for 2001 was 8% hedged at 68 cents per gallon 20 excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads (see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Materials and Supplies Expenses increased $6 million (1%), reflecting volume related increases in car and locomotive repairs, partially offset by productivity improvements and cost control measures. Casualty Costs Costs decreased $15 million (4%) compared to 1999, primarily as a result of lower settlement costs. Other Costs Expenses decreased $31 million (4%) compared to 1999. Cost control, productivity gains, and lower contract services expenses more than offset volume related cost increases and higher state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased $81 million (4%) to $1.9 billion. Excluding the work force reduction charge, operating income increased $196 million (11%) to a record $2.0 billion. The operating ratio for 2000 was 82.3%. Excluding the work force reduction charge, the operating ratio was 81.2%, 0.8 percentage points better than 1999s 82.0% operating ratio. NON OPERATING ITEMS Other income increased $11 million (10%), primarily the result of higher real estate sales. Interest expense decreased $26 million (4%) primarily as a result of lower average debt levels compared to 1999. Excluding the effect of the work force reduction charge, income taxes increased $89 million (19%) for the year, reflecting higher income levels and 1999 settlements related to prior tax years. TRUCKING SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES In 2000, trucking revenues rose $51 million (5%) to over $1.1 billion. The growth resulted primarily from yield initiatives, new services and the impact of a fuel surcharge assessed due to higher fuel prices. Partially offsetting this growth was a 4% decline in tonnage compared to 1999. OPERATING EXPENSES Trucking operating expenses rose $18 million (2%) to $1.1 billion in 2000. Salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased $1 million as lower volume, lower employment levels and productivity gains offset wage and benefit inflation. Fuel and utilities costs increased $23 million (47%), primarily as a result of significantly higher fuel prices (90 cents per gallon average in 2000 compared to 54 cents per gallon average in 1999, including transportation costs and regional pricing spreads, and excluding taxes). Overnite hedged 9% of 2000 fuel consumption at an average price of 39 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs, and regional pricing spreads, which decreased costs by $2 million. As of December 31, 2000, Overnite had not hedged any of its expected 2001 fuel consumption. Equipment and other rents increased $2 million (2%) primarily due to an increase in purchased transportation costs in response to the ongoing Teamsters activity. Casualty costs and other costs decreased $7 million (5%), primarily due to lower expenses related to the Teamsters activity and also lower cargo loss and damage expenses. OPERATING INCOME Trucking operations generated operating income of $53 million in 2000, compared to $20 million for 1999. The operating ratio improved to 95.2%, compared to 98.1% in 1999. OTHER PRODUCT LINES OTHER Operating losses increased by $15 million in 2000 compared to 1999. Operating revenues declined $1 million year over year. Operating expenses increased $14 million, primarily due to increased spending at Fenix as part of its overall strategy of developing new products and services. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash from operations was $2.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to the timing of large cash payments, including the payments for the work force 21 reduction plan. The increase from 1999 to 2000 reflects higher income from continuing operations and decreased cash payouts in 2000 for merger related expenses and customer claims. Cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2001 and $1.6 billion in 2000 and 1999. The decrease from 2000 to 2001 is due to reduced capital spending and higher asset sales in 2001, partially offset by the receipt of cash dividends in 2000. Cash used in financing activities was $440 million, $486 million and $256 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease from 2000 to 2001 reflects higher debt and other financings in 2001 ($977 million in 2001 versus $509 million in 2000), partially offset by higher debt repayments ($1.2 billion in 2001 versus $796 million in 2000). The increase from 1999 to 2000 reflects higher debt repayments ($796 million in 2000 versus $692 million in 1999) and lower financings ($509 million in 2000 versus $634 million in 1999). Including the convertible preferred securities (see note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8) as an equity instrument, the ratio of debt to total capital employed was 42.2%, 45.1% and 47.6% at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, as referenced in the tables below, the Corporation has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect the financial condition of the Corporation. However, based on managements assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the Corporation, including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material effect on the Corporations financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the commercial obligations, financings and commitments made by the Corporation are customary transactions which are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations, particularly within the transportation industry. The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Less Than After Millions of Dollars Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Debt (note 7)[a] ..................... $ 6,639 $ 94 $ 1,433 $ 1,175 $ 3,937 Operating leases (note 8) ............ 3,322 435 651 546 1,690 Capital lease obligations (note 8) ... 2,452 207 403 344 1,498 Unconditional purchase obligations (note 12)[b] ..................... 547 162 385 Total contractual obligations ........ $ 12,960 $ 898 $ 2,872 $ 2,065 $ 7,125 [a] Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,441 million. [b] Unconditional purchase obligations represent multi year contractual commitments to purchase assets at fixed prices and fixed volumes. These commitments are made in order to take advantage of pricing opportunities and to insure availability of assets to meet quality and operational requirements. Excluded are annual contracts made in the normal course of business for performance of routine services, as well as commitments where contract provisions allow for cancellation. 22 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Other Commercial Commitments Amounts Less Than After Millions of Dollars Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Credit facilities (note 7) ................. $ 2,000 $ 1,000 $ $ 1,000 $ Convertible preferred securities (note 7) .. 1,500 1,500 Sale of receivables (note 4) ............... 600 600 Guarantees (note 12)[a] .................... 270 7 32 10 221 Standby letters of credit (note 12) ........ 45 45 Total commercial commitments ............... $ 4,415 $ 1,652 $ 32 $ 1,010 $ 1,721 [a] Includes guaranteed obligations of affiliated operations. FINANCING ACTIVITIES CREDIT FACILITIES On December 31, 2001, the Corporation had $2.0 billion in revolving credit facilities, of which $1.0 billion expires in March 2002, with the remaining $1.0 billion expiring in 2005. The facilities, which were entered into during March 2001, and March of 2000, respectively, are designated for general corporate purposes and replaced a $2.8 billion facility, which expired in April 2001. None of the credit facilities were used as of December 31, 2001 or 2000. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade corporate borrowers. The Corporation is reviewing rollover options for the credit facility that expires in March 2002. SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT In January 2001, under an existing shelf registration statement, the Corporation issued $400 million of fixed rate debt at 6.65% with a maturity date of January 15, 2011. During May 2001, the Corporation issued the remaining $200 million of debt securities available under this shelf registration statement as fixed rate debt at 5.84% with a maturity date of May 25, 2004. Simultaneously, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap converting the debt, issued in May 2001, from a fixed rate to a variable rate. The proceeds from the issuance of this debt were used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes. In June 2001, the Corporation filed a new $1.0 billion shelf registration statement, which became effective June 14, 2001. Under this shelf registration statement, the Corporation may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. The total offering price of these securities, in the aggregate, can not exceed $1.0 billion. On October 1, 2001, the Corporation issued $300 million of fixed rate debt at 5.75% with a maturity date of October 15, 2007. The proceeds from the issuance of this debt were used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2001, the Corporation had $700 million remaining for issuance under the shelf registration. On January 17, 2002, the Corporation issued an additional $300 million of fixed rate debt at 6.125% with a maturity date of January 15, 2012. The proceeds from the issuance were also used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes. At January 24, 2002, the Corporation had $400 million remaining for issuance under the shelf registration. The Corporation has no immediate plans to issue equity securities under this shelf registration. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FINANCINGS During July 2001, UPRR entered into capital leases covering new locomotives. The related capital lease obligations totaled approximately $124 million and are included in the Statements of Consolidated Financial Position as debt (see note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). 23 In December 2001, the Railroad entered into a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building which will be constructed in Omaha, Nebraska. The expected completion date of the building is 2004. It will total approximately 1.1 million square feet with approximately 3,800 office workspaces. The cost to construct the new headquarters, including capitalized interest, is approximately $260 million. The Corporation has guaranteed the Railroads obligation under this lease. UPRR will be the construction agent for the lessor. Total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding commitments as of December 31, 2001, were approximately $10 million. After construction is complete, the lease has an initial term of five years and provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to agreement between the Railroad and lessor. At any time during the lease, the Railroad may, at its option, purchase the building at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building. If the Railroad elects not to renew the lease or purchase the building, the Railroad has guaranteed a residual value of approximately $220 million. At December 31, 2001, the Railroad has guaranteed, under certain circumstances, a residual value of less than $10 million. OTHER MATTERS PERSONAL INJURY The cost of injuries to employees and others on Railroad property or in accidents involving the trucking segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. In 2001, the Railroads work related injuries that resulted in lost job time declined 7% compared to 2000. In addition, accidents at grade crossings decreased 6% compared to 2000. Annual expenses for the Railroads personal injury related events were $204 million in 2001, reflecting lower than anticipated settlement costs, $207 million in 2000 and $228 million in 1999. Compensation for Railroad work related accidents is governed by the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements. The Railroad offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS The Corporation generates and transports hazardous and nonhazardous waste in its current and former operations, and is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The Corporation has identified approximately 370 active sites at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 48 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 28 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, the Corporations ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to other parties, in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site. When environmental issues have been identified with respect to the property owned, leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the Corporations business, the Corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such property. The Corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred. The Corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation has a liability of $172 million accrued for future environmental costs. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as for ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws and regulations. The Corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability. However, the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and or the speculative nature of remediation costs. The Corporation expects to pay out the majority of the December 31, 2001, environmental liability over the next five years, funded by cash generated from operations. Remediation of identified sites previously used in operations, used by tenants or contaminated by former owners required cash spending of $63 million in 2001, $62 million in 2000 and $56 million in 1999. The Corporation is also 24 engaged in reducing emissions, spills and migration of hazardous materials, and spent cash of $5 million, $8 million and $5 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for control and prevention. In 2002, the Corporation anticipates spending $60 million for remediation and $5 million for control and prevention. The impact of current obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Corporation. LABOR MATTERS Rail Approximately 87% of the Railroads nearly 48,000 employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. National negotiations under the Railway Labor Act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late 1999. In May 2001, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE) ratified a five year agreement, which included provisions for an annual wage increase (based on the consumer price index) and progressive health and welfare cost sharing. The health and welfare cost sharing was a milestone as the BMWE is the first union to make significant cost contributions to their health and welfare plan. Contract discussions with the remaining unions are either in negotiation or mediation. Also during 2001, much of the operating craft unions focus was on the proposed merger between the United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE). In a December 2001 re vote, the BLE resoundingly rejected the merger. Both operating craft unions have indicated a desire to complete national negotiations. The Corporation anticipates significant progress in 2002. Trucking Overnite continues to oppose the efforts of the Teamsters to unionize Overnite service centers. Since the Teamsters began their efforts at Overnite in 1994, Overnite has received 90 petitions for union elections at 66 of its 170 service centers, although there have been only nine elections since August 1997, and Teamsters representation was rejected in seven of those nine elections. Twenty two service centers, representing approximately 14% of Overnites nearly 13,000 nationwide employee work force, have voted for union representation, and the Teamsters have been certified and recognized as the bargaining representative for such employees. Employees at 18 of these 22 locations have filed decertification petitions since 1999. Elections affecting approximately 400 additional employees are unresolved, and there are no elections currently scheduled. Additionally, proceedings are pending in certain cases where a Teamsters local union lost a representation election. To date, Overnite has not entered into any collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters, who began a job action on October 24, 1999, that has continued into 2002. As of January 19, 2002, 19 Overnite service centers had approximately 369 employees, less than 3% of Overnites work force, who did not report to work. Despite the work stoppage, Overnite has managed to improve its revenue and profitability on a year over year basis. Employees at two Motor Cargo service centers located in North Salt Lake, Utah and Reno, Nevada, representing approximately 11% of Motor Cargos total work force at 30 service centers, are covered by two separate collective bargaining agreements with unions affiliated with the Teamsters. Although the agreements cover most of the employees at these two facilities, less than half of these covered employees are actual members of unions. INFLATION The cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies such as the Railroad, Overnite and Motor Cargo. As a result, depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis, assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels, would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Corporation and its subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments, which are subject to market risk, in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve the Corporations interest rate objectives. The Corporation uses swaps, futures and or forward contracts to mitigate adverse price movements and exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements. The Corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate changes and hedge the exposure to fair value changes. The purpose of these programs is to protect the Corporations operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations. The Corporation may also use fuel swaptions to secure more favorable swap prices. Swaptions are swaps that are extendable past their base period at the option of the counterparty. Swaptions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through the Consolidated Statements of Income. 25 The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on the Corporations financial instruments. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results. Interest Rates The Corporation manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within its debt portfolio over a given period. The mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or incremental borrowings are required. Derivatives are used in limited circumstances as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix and hedge the exposure to fair value changes. In addition, the Corporation obtains flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within its debt portfolio by issuing callable fixed rate debt securities. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Corporation had variable rate debt representing approximately 12% and 6%, respectively, of its total debt. If variable interest rates average 10% higher in 2002 than the Corporations December 31, 2001 variable rate, which was approximately 3%, the Corporations interest expense would increase by less than $5 million after tax. If variable interest rates had averaged 10% higher in 2001 than the Corporations December 31, 2000 variable rate, the Corporations interest expense would have increased by less than $5 million after tax. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of the Corporations variable rate debt at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In May and August 2001, the Corporation entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $598 million of debt with varying maturity dates extending to November 2004. The swaps allowed the Corporation to convert the debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). The swaps have been accounted for using the short cut method as allowed by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement (FASB) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133); and therefore, no ineffectiveness has been recorded within the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. The effect of a 10% interest rate increase or decrease in 2002 over the December 31, 2001 rates is included in the preceding or succeeding paragraph disclosure, respectively. The Corporation had not entered into any interest rate swaps at December 31, 2000. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2001, and amounts to approximately $226 million at December 31, 2001. Market risk resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2000, amounted to approximately $307 million at December 31, 2000. The fair values of the Corporations fixed rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates. Fuel Fuel costs are a significant portion of the Corporations total operating expenses. As a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical volatility of fuel prices, the Corporations transportation subsidiaries periodically use swaps, futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. The Corporation at times may use swaptions to secure more favorable swap prices. As of December 31, 2001, expected rail fuel consumption for 2002 is 44% hedged (or swaptions are in place) at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. As of December 31, 2001, expected rail fuel consumption for 2003 is 5% hedged (or swaptions are in place) at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. For the Corporations fuel hedges, if rail fuel prices decrease 10% from the December 31, 2001 level, the corresponding increase in fuel expense would be approximately $20 million after tax. For the Corporations swaptions, if rail fuel prices decrease 10% from the December 31, 2001 level, the corresponding increase in expense would be approximately $4 million after tax. As of December 31, 2000, the Corporation had hedged approximately 8% of its forecasted 2001 fuel consumption at 68 cents per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. If rail fuel prices had decreased 10% from the December 31, 2000 level, the corresponding increase in fuel expense would have been approximately $5 million after tax. 26 As of December 31, 2001, expected trucking fuel consumption for 2002 is 16% hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spread. As of December 31, 2001, expected trucking fuel consumption for 2003 is 5% hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. If trucking fuel prices decrease 10% from the December 31, 2001 level, the corresponding increase in fuel expense would be less than $1 million after tax. As of December 31, 2000, the trucking segment had not hedged any expected fuel consumption for 2001. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Effective January 1, 2001, the Corporation adopted FAS 133 and FASB No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" (FAS 138). FAS 133 and FAS 138 require that the changes in fair value of all derivative financial instruments the Corporation uses for fuel or interest rate hedging purposes be recorded in the Corporations Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In addition, to the extent fuel hedges are ineffective due to pricing differentials resulting from the geographic dispersion of the Corporations operations, income statement recognition of the ineffective portion of the hedge position may be required. Also, derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per FAS 133 and FAS 138 may require income statement recognition. The adoption of FAS 133 and FAS 138 resulted in the recognition of a $2 million asset on January 1, 2001, (see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). In September 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" (FAS 140), replacing FASB No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" (FAS 125). FAS 140 revises criteria for accounting for securitizations, other financial asset transfers and collateral and introduces new disclosures. FAS 140 was effective for fiscal 2000 with respect to the new disclosure requirements and amendments of the collateral provisions originally presented in FAS 125. All other provisions were effective for transfers of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. The provisions are to be applied prospectively with certain exceptions. The adoption of FAS 140 did not have a significant impact on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations" (FAS 141). FAS 141 revises the method of accounting for business combinations and eliminates the pooling method of accounting. FAS 141 was effective for all business combinations that were initiated or completed after June 30, 2001. Management believes that FAS 141 will not have a material impact on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. Also in July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (FAS 142). FAS 142 revises the method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. FAS 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill, but requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level. FAS 142 is effective for the Corporations fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002. Management believes that FAS 142 will not have a material impact on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with FAS 142, the Corporation will eliminate annual goodwill amortization of $2 million. At December 31, 2001, the Corporation had $50 million of goodwill remaining. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (FAS 143). FAS 143 is effective for the Corporations fiscal year beginning January 1, 2003, and requires the Corporation to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in October 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (FAS 144). FAS 144 replaces FASB Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of" (FAS 121). FAS 144 develops one accounting model, based on the framework established in FAS 121, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The accounting model applies to all long lived assets, including discontinued operations, and it replaces the provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for disposal of segments of a business. FAS 144 requires that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. FAS 144 also broadens the definition of discontinued operations. FAS 144 is 27 effective for the Corporations fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002. Management believes that FAS 144 will not have a material impact on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES There are various claims and lawsuits pending against the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. The Corporation is also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, pursuant to which it is currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites. A discussion of certain claims, lawsuits, contingent liabilities and guarantees is set forth in note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8. A LOOK FORWARD 2002 BUSINESS OUTLOOK RAIL The Railroad expects to build on the positive momentum generated in the past several years and continue to grow revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. The impact in 2001 of economic recession and declining industrial production is expected to subside in the latter half of 2002. Year over year revenue growth is projected in the economically sensitive intermodal, chemical and industrial products commodity segments. Agricultural products, notably wheat, is also expected to improve. Energy revenue is expected to decline slightly from the record setting pace of 2001. Automotive revenue is also expected to decrease; however, new contracts in the automotive sector are expected to help mitigate this decline, and, therefore, the automotive sector should continue to be a strong revenue provider. The Railroad will continue to focus on improving service performance and developing new, innovative rail service offerings to meet the changing needs of its customers. Cost control and continuing improvements in productivity should help drive the operating ratio lower. Fuel prices are expected to be substantially below the levels of the past two years, but will still be susceptible to volatile price swings. To help reduce the impact of fuel price volatility on earnings, the Railroad will continue to look for opportunities to use hedge contracts. On December 21, 2001, The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act of 2001 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act was a result of historic cooperation between rail management and labor, and provides improved railroad retirement benefits for employees and reduced payroll taxes for employers. Although the exact impact is not yet known, the Railroad anticipates that the phased in tax reductions will have a beneficial impact on its financial results in the future. TRUCKING Overnite expects financial performance to improve in the second half of 2002 following difficult economic conditions during the first half of the year. Operating expenses are projected to be positively impacted by lower fuel prices, cost control and productivity improvements, which will mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures. Overnite will continue to offer reliable on time performance and quality service, which should enable Overnite to maintain profitable margins. The addition of Motor Cargo will enable the trucking segment to provide expanded regional coverage in the western United States. 2002 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS The Corporations 2002 capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations, additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties. The Corporation expects that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet cash requirements in the foreseeable future. In 2002, the Railroad expects to spend approximately $1.7 billion on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on its main lines, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build infrastructure and develop and implement new technologies.
