ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, and other information included in this Form 10 K. As stated in Item 1, Union Pacific Corporation (UPC or the Corporation) consists of two reportable segments, rail and trucking, as well as UPCs other product lines (Other). The rail segment includes the operations of Union Pacific Railroad and its subsidiaries and rail affiliates (UPRR or the Railroad). The trucking segment includes Overnite Transportation Company (OTC) and Motor Cargo Industries, Inc. (Motor Cargo) as of November 30, 2001, both operating as separate and distinct subsidiaries of Overnite Corporation (Overnite), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UPC. The Corporations other product lines are comprised of the corporate holding company (which largely supports the Railroad), self insurance activities, technology companies and all appropriate consolidating entries (see note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Corporations discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect 15 the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. The Corporation bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following are the Corporations critical accounting policies that affect significant areas of the Corporations operations and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ materially from actual results, the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. DEPRECIATION Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation. Various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property. Due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets, variances to those estimates could have a material effect on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. ENVIRONMENTAL The Corporation generates and transports hazardous and non hazardous waste in its current and former operations, and is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The Corporation has identified approximately 433 sites at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 52 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 27 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, the Corporations ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site. When an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned, leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the Corporations business, the Corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such property. The Corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred. The Corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as for ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws and regulations. The Corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability. However, the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and or the speculative nature of remediation costs. INCOME TAXES The Corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FAS 109). The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on the Corporations financial position or its results of operations. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Corporation incurs certain employment related expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health benefits. In order to measure the expense associated with these benefits, management must make various estimates and assumptions, including discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates and expected future healthcare costs. The estimates used by management are based on the Corporations historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. The Corporation uses third party actuaries to assist management in properly measuring the expense and liability associated with these benefits. Actual future results that vary from the previously mentioned assumptions could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent declines in the equity markets have caused the market value of the plan assets to decrease. As a result, a minimum pension liability adjustment of $225 million, net of tax, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 as a reduction to shareholders equity (see note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Also, during 2002, the Corporation decreased its assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets from 10% to 9%. This assumption change resulted 16 in a $22 million increase to 2002 pension expense. While the interest rate and asset return environment have significantly impacted the funded status of the Corporations plans, the Corporation does not have any minimum pension funding requirements, as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws. PERSONAL INJURY AND OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS The cost of injuries to employees and others related to Railroad activities or in accidents involving the trucking segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. Compensation for Railroad work related accidents is governed by the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements. The Railroad offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. Changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to personal injury and occupational illness cases based on large jury awards and public pressures associated with certain occupational related injuries. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME The Corporation reported net income of $1.34 billion ($5.32 per basic share and $5.05 per diluted share) in 2002 compared to $966 million ($3.90 per basic share and $3.77 per diluted share) in 2001. The increase in net income resulted from double digit operating income growth, lower interest costs, two large asset sale transactions (one with the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) for $141 million pre tax and one with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) for $73 million pre tax) and tax adjustments of $67 million for prior years income tax examinations. Operating income improved as revenue growth, lower fuel prices and productivity gains offset the effects of wage and benefit inflation and higher volume related costs. Productivity is measured by both gross ton miles per inflation adjusted expense dollar and gross ton miles per employee. OPERATING REVENUES Operating revenues increased $518 million (4%) to a record $12.5 billion in 2002, reflecting 3% growth at the Railroad and 17% growth in the trucking segment including the impact of the Motor Cargo acquisition. Excluding Motor Cargo, revenue growth was 5% in the trucking segment. The Corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. Other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses increased $266 million (3%) to $10.2 billion in 2002 from $9.9 billion in 2001. Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, operating expenses increased $144 million (1%). The increase in expenses reflects wage and benefit inflation, higher equipment rents and depreciation expenses and increased purchased services and other costs. These increases were partially offset by a 3% reduction in employment levels at the Railroad, lower fuel prices and cost control efforts. Lower fuel prices for the Railroad of 73 cents per gallon in 2002 versus 88 cents per gallon in 2001, reduced fuel expense by $198 million in 2002. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $225 million (5%) compared to 2001. Excluding Motor Cargo, expenses increased $156 million (4%) compared to 2001 as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity. Equipment and other rents expense increased $59 million (5%) as a result of a 2% increase in carloads, additional locomotive lease expense and higher contract maintenance costs recognized at Overnite. Depreciation expense increased $32 million (3%) as a result of the Railroads capital spending in recent years which has increased the total value of the Corporations assets subject to depreciation. Fuel and utilities costs were down $183 million (14%) compared to 2001 due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption rate, partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the Railroad. Materials and supplies expense decreased $7 million (1%) primarily due to reduced locomotive repairs partly offset by increased freight car repairs. Casualty costs increased $38 million (10%) over 2001 due to higher personal injury and increased insurance costs. Purchased services and other costs increased $102 million (11%) primarily due to an increase in outsourcing of locomotive contract maintenance services, as well as an increase in jointly owned facility expenses and state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased $252 million (12%) to a record $2.3 billion in 2002, as revenue growth, productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation, increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume. 17 NON OPERATING ITEMS Interest expense decreased $68 million (10%) compared to 2001 due to lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in 2002. In 2002, the Corporations weighted average debt level (including the Convertible Preferred Securities) decreased from $9,980 million in 2001 to $9,525 million in 2002. The Corporations weighted average interest rate was 6.7% in 2002 as compared to 7.0% in 2001. Other income increased $163 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to the asset sale transactions with the UTA and VTA. Income tax expense increased $108 million (19%) in 2002 over 2001 as a result of higher pre tax income levels in 2002 which was partially offset by tax adjustments for prior years. KEY MEASURES Net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 10.7% in 2002 from 8.1% in 2001. Return on average common shareholders equity was 13.3% in 2002, up from 10.6% in 2001. The Corporations operating margin was 18.6% in 2002 compared to 17.3% in 2001. The Corporations operating margin, excluding Overnite for 2002 was 20.2% compared to 18.6% in 2001. RAIL SEGMENT NET INCOME Rail operations reported net income of $1.37 billion in 2002 compared to $1.06 billion in 2001, up 30%. The increase in earnings resulted from stronger operating results, the asset sale transactions with the UTA and VTA, lower interest costs, and a tax adjustment for prior years income tax examinations. Higher operating revenue and lower fuel expense combined with productivity gains and cost control efforts offset inflation and higher volume related costs. OPERATING REVENUES Operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues. Other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various non railroad companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the Railroad, revenue from the Chicago commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of railroad owned or controlled equipment. Rail operating revenues increased $303 million (3%) over 2001 to a record $11.1 billion. Revenue carloads increased 2% primarily driven by growth in the automotive, intermodal and chemicals commodity groups. Other revenue increased $31 million (8%) due to increased passenger, subsidiary, and accessorial revenues. The following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue, revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type: Commodity Revenue in Millions of Dollars 2002 2001 Change Agricultural ...................................... $ 1,506 $ 1,454 4% Automotive ........................................ 1,209 1,118 8 Chemicals ......................................... 1,575 1,545 2 Energy ............................................ 2,343 2,399 (2) Industrial Products ............................... 2,035 1,970 3 Intermodal ........................................ 1,995 1,905 5 Total ............................................. $ 10,663 $ 10,391 3% Revenue Carloads in Thousands 2002 2001 Change Agricultural....................................... 881 876 1% Automotive......................................... 818 763 7 Chemicals.......................................... 904 879 3 Energy............................................. 2,164 2,161 Industrial Products................................ 1,413 1,405 1 Intermodal......................................... 2,951 2,832 4 Total.............................................. 9,131 8,916 2% Average Revenue Per Car 2002 2001 Change Agricultural....................................... $ 1,709 $ 1,660 3% Automotive......................................... 1,477 1,465 1 Chemicals.......................................... 1,742 1,756 (1) Energy............................................. 1,083 1,111 (3) Industrial Products................................ 1,440 1,402 3 Intermodal......................................... 676 673 Total.............................................. $ 1,168 $ 1,165 % 18 Agricultural Revenue increased 4%, due to a 1% increase in carloads coupled with a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Meals and oils carloads increased due to strong export demand and more shipments to Mexico. Corn shipments to Mexico also increased. Revenue gains were also achieved through increased shipments of cottonseed, ethanol used as a fuel additive and frozen french fries. Average revenue per car increased due to a higher average length of haul, resulting from fewer short haul empty storage moves and corn processor shipments combined with increased long haul meals and oils and animal feed shipments. Automotive Revenue increased 8%, as a result of a 7% increase in carloads and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Volume growth resulted from market share gains for finished vehicles, where carloads were up 11% despite a decline in U.S. light vehicle sales. Materials shipments declined 1%, due primarily to reduced production in Mexico. Market share gains partially offset the decline. Average revenue per car increased due to a shift in mix of carloads shipped, resulting from increased higher average revenue per car vehicles shipments and a decline in lower average revenue per car materials shipments. In addition, average length of haul for vehicle shipments increased. Chemicals Revenue increased 2%, as a result of a 3% increase in carloads and a 1% decrease in average revenue per car. Volume increased for liquid and dry chemicals due to relatively higher economic demand from industrial manufacturers. Plastics shipments rose as a result of increased demand for consumer durables. Revenue also increased due to higher domestic demand for fertilizer and demand for domestic and export soda ash shipments. Average revenue per car declined due to changes in customer contract terms. Energy Energy commodity revenue decreased 2% as average revenue per car declined 3%. Records were set for total carloads and coal trains loaded per day in the Southern Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Results were achieved through favorable weather conditions and improved cycle times. Offsetting the volume increase were reduced West Coast export shipments originating from the Colorado and Utah mining regions. Average revenue per car declined due to the impact of contract price negotiations on expiring long term contracts with certain major customers. Industrial Products Revenue increased 3%, due to a slight increase in carloads coupled with a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Increased lumber shipments were the primary growth driver, due to strong housing construction and greater production in the Pacific Northwest region. Stone shipments increased due to strong building and road construction activity in the South. Revenue also increased for paper and newsprint commodities due to higher general demand. Reduced shipments of steel and metallic shipments in the first three quarters partially offset these increases. However, steel shipments rebounded in the fourth quarter as new U.S. tariffs made domestic producers more price competitive with foreign producers. Average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul. Intermodal Revenue increased 5%, primarily due to a 4% increase in carloads. Volumes increased due to higher international shipments, resulting from strong import demand and market share gains in some segments. These gains were partially offset by the labor dispute between the International Longshoreman and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the Pacific Maritime Association, which had a significant impact on intermodal volumes during the fourth quarter, primarily in October. Revenue declined for domestic shipments, due to soft market demand and the voluntary action of shedding low margin trailer business in favor of higher margin containers. The slight increase in average revenue per car was the result of price increases, offset by the mix impact of more lower revenue per car international shipments. Mexico Business In 2002 and 2001, respectively, UPRR generated $873 million and $860 million of revenues from rail traffic with businesses located in Mexico, which is included in the rail commodity revenue reported above. Shipments increased for agricultural products, chemicals, and industrial products commodity groups. Increased revenue for agricultural products resulted from higher corn and meal exports as well as increased beer imports. Increased chemicals business consisted of plastics exports, in addition to higher imports and exports of liquid and dry chemicals. The increase in industrial products resulted from higher imports and exports of steel and scrap and exports of pulp and paper products. Reduced automobile production partially offset these gains resulting in fewer shipments of parts and finished vehicles. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses increased $51 million (1%) to $8.8 billion in 2002. The increase in expense is primarily due to inflation, increased volume related costs, contract services, casualty and depreciation expense, partially offset by savings from lower employee force levels, cost control efforts and significantly lower fuel prices. 19 Salaries, Wages and Employee Benefits Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $76 million (2%) in 2002 to $3.6 billion. Increases were driven by inflation and volume related costs related to a 4% increase in gross ton miles. A 3% reduction in employee force levels in conjunction with worker productivity improvements partially offset the inflation and higher volume related costs. Equipment and Other Rents Equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal and locomotive leases; other specialty equipped vehicle leases; and office and other rentals. Expenses increased $24 million (2%) compared to 2001 due primarily to higher locomotive leases and volume related costs, partially offset by savings from lower car cycle times (the average number of accumulated days per load or cycle that loaded and empty cars from other railroads spend on UPRRs system) and rental prices for private cars. The higher locomotive lease expense is due to the Railroads increased leasing of new, more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives. These new locomotives replaced older, non leased models in the fleet, which helped reduce expenses for depreciation, labor, materials and fuel during the year. The increase in volume costs is primarily due to increased shipments of finished autos that almost exclusively utilize rented freight cars. The reduction in car cycle times is attributable to increased volume demand and better car utilization. Depreciation The majority of depreciation relates to track structure, including rail, ties and other track material. Depreciation expense increased $19 million (2%) over 2001 as a result of higher capital spending in recent years. Capital spending totaled $1.8 billion in 2002 and $1.7 billion in 2001. Fuel and Utilities Fuel and utilities is comprised of locomotive fuel, utilities other than telephone, and gasoline and other fuels. Expenses declined $184 million (15%) in 2002. The decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate, as measured by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles. Fuel prices averaged 73 cents per gallon in 2002 compared to 88 cents per gallon in 2001 (including taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads). The Railroad hedged approximately 42% of its fuel consumption for the year, which decreased fuel costs by $55 million. As of December 31, 2002, expected fuel consumption for 2003 is 7% hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads (see note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Materials and Supplies Materials used for the maintenance of the Railroads track, facilities and equipment is the principal component of materials and supplies expense. Office, small tools and other supplies and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included. Expenses decreased $9 million (2%), primarily reflecting a reduction in the number of locomotives overhauled. Materials expense for locomotive overhauls decreased due to the use of new, more reliable locomotives during the past several years, the sale of older units, which required higher maintenance, and increased outsourcing of locomotive maintenance. Partially offsetting the reductions in locomotive overhauls was an increase in cost for freight car repairs. Casualty Costs The largest component of casualty costs is personal injury expense. Freight and property damage, insurance, environmental matters and occupational illness expense are also included in casualty costs. Costs increased $32 million (10%) compared to 2001, as higher personal injury and insurance costs were partially offset by lower costs for freight damage. Purchased Services and Other Costs Purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, state and local taxes, net costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads, transportation and lodging for train crew employees, trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers, leased automobile maintenance expenses, telephone and cellular expense, employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses. Expenses increased $93 million (11%) compared to 2001 primarily due to increased spending for contract services, jointly operated facilities and state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased $252 million (12%) to a record $2.3 billion in 2002. The operating margin for 2002 was 21.0%, compared to 19.3% in 2001. NON OPERATING ITEMS Interest expense decreased $43 million (7%) as a result of lower average debt levels and lower weighted average interest rates in 2002. Other income increased $147 million (84%) due to the sale transactions with the UTA and VTA. Income taxes increased $126 million (21%) in 2002 compared to 2001 resulting from higher pre tax income levels in 2002 partially offset by a tax adjustment for prior years income tax examinations. 20 TRUCKING SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES In 2002, trucking revenues rose $189 million (17%) to $1.33 billion. Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, revenue increased $57 million (5%) due to an increase in volume of 5%, yield improvements, and higher revenue for special services, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices in 2002. Included in the volume improvement was additional business realized as a result of the forced closure of Consolidated Freightways in September 2002. OPERATING EXPENSES Trucking operating expenses rose $172 million (16%) to $1.26 billion in 2002. Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expenses increased $50 million (5%). Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $117 million (17%). Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expenses increased $48 million (7%) due to wage and benefit inflation and increased volume costs partially offset by productivity improvements and a 2% reduction in the number of employees. Productivity is measured as total costs related to local, dock, and linehaul operations relative to the total volume shipped. Equipment and other rents increased $33 million (35%). Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expenses increased $18 million (20%) due primarily to the increased use of linehaul rail and contract transportation to handle the additional business of the former Consolidated Freightways. Depreciation expense increased $11 million (23%) compared to 2001. Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expense increased $2 million (5%) due to purchases of new equipment. Fuel and utilities costs increased $1 million (1%). Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expenses decreased $7 million (11%) as a result of lower fuel prices during the year (74 cents per gallon average in 2002 compared to 82 cents per gallon average in 2001, including transportation costs but excluding taxes), and by a 3% decrease in gallons consumed. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Overnite hedged approximately 14% of its fuel consumed for 2002, which decreased fuel prices by $1.2 million. As of December 31, 2002, expected fuel consumption for 2003 is 5% hedged at 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. Materials and supplies expense increased $4 million (8%) compared to 2001. Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expenses decreased $2 million (4%) due to lower maintenance and operating supplies expense as a result of cost control measures. Casualty costs increased $8 million (17%). Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expenses increased $6 million (12%) due to higher personal injury and insurance expenses. Purchased services and other costs decreased $2 million (2%). Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, expenses decreased $15 million (16%) due to lower general supplies expense, a favorable legal settlement in the second quarter, insourcing of contract programmers, and other cost control measures. OPERATING INCOME Trucking operations generated operating income of $71 million in 2002, an increase of $17 million over 2001. Excluding Motor Cargo in 2002 and 2001, operating income increased $8 million (14%). The operating margin was 5.3% compared to 4.7% in 2001. Motor Cargo improved the operating margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2002. OTHER PRODUCT LINES OTHER Operating losses increased $17 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Operating revenues increased $26 million year over year resulting from operations of a new logistics subsidiary created in the latter part of 2001 and increased external revenues from two technology subsidiaries. Operating expenses increased $43 million primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense, pension and retiree benefit costs in 2002, as well as asset write offs at two technology subsidiaries. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME The Corporation reported net income of $966 million ($3.90 per basic share and $3.77 per diluted share) in 2001 compared to $842 million ($3.42 per basic share and $3.34 per diluted share) in 2000. Excluding the effect of a $115 million pre tax ($72 million after tax) charge in 2000 related to a work force reduction plan at the Railroad, 2000 net income was $914 million ($3.71 per basic share and $3.61 per diluted share). The increase in net income excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000 was due primarily to revenue growth, productivity gains and cost control, lower non operating expense and lower fuel prices. OPERATING REVENUES Operating revenues increased $95 million (1%) to $12.0 billion in 2001, reflecting 1% growth at the Railroad and 3% growth in the trucking segment. The Corporation recognizes transportation revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. Other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. 21 OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased $74 million (1%) to $9.9 billion in 2001 from $10.0 billion in 2000. Excluding the effect of the work force reduction charge in 2000, operating expenses increased $41 million compared to 2000 reflecting wage and benefit inflation and higher equipment rents and depreciation expenses. These increases were partially offset by a 4% reduction in employment levels at the Railroad, lower fuel prices and cost control efforts. Lower fuel prices in 2001 versus 2000 reduced fuel expense by $35 million in 2001. Salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased $35 million compared to 2000. Excluding the work force reduction charge, salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $80 million (2%), as wage and benefit inflation and volume costs exceeded savings from lower employment levels and improved productivity. Equipment and other rents expense increased $26 million (2%) as a result of additional locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times, which indicates that cars spent more time on the rail system between shipments. Partially offsetting these increases were lower costs due to declines in rail traffic requiring rental of freight cars. In addition, the Railroad experienced lower rental rates, and Overnite experienced lower contract transportation costs. Depreciation expense increased $34 million (3%) as a result of the Railroads capital spending in recent years which increased the total value of the Corporations assets subject to depreciation (see note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Fuel and utilities costs were down $34 million (3%) compared to 2000 due to lower fuel prices and a lower fuel consumption rate, partially offset by higher gross ton miles at the Railroad and losses on fuel hedging activity (see note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). Materials and supplies expense decreased $56 million (9%) primarily due to reduced locomotive repairs and cost control actions. Casualty costs increased $16 million (4%) over 2000 due to higher insurance, bad debts and environmental expenses. Other costs decreased $25 million (3%) as productivity and cost control efforts more than offset higher state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased $169 million (9%) to $2.1 billion in 2001. Excluding the effect of the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, 2001 operating income increased $54 million (3%) as revenue growth, productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation, increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume. NON OPERATING ITEMS Interest expense decreased $22 million (3%) compared to 2000 due to lower weighted average debt levels and weighted average interest rates in 2001. In 2001, the Corporations weighted average debt level decreased from $10,044 million in 2000 to $9,980 million in 2001. The Corporations weighted average interest rate was 7.0% in 2001 as compared to 7.2% in 2000. Other income increased $32 million (25%) in 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to higher real estate sales. Income tax expense increased $99 million (21%) in 2001 over 2000. Excluding the effect of the $115 million work force reduction charge on income tax expense in 2000, income taxes for 2001 increased $56 million (11%) over 2000. The increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in 2001 and an increase in the effective tax rate from 35.7% in 2000 to 37.0% in 2001. KEY MEASURES Net income as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 8.1% in 2001 from 7.1% in 2000. Net income as a percentage of operating revenues in 2000, excluding the work force reduction charge, was 7.7%. Return on average common shareholders equity was 10.6% in 2001, up from 10.1% in 2000. Excluding the charge in 2000, return on average common shareholders equity was 10.9% in 2000. The Corporations operating margin was 17.3% in 2001 compared to 16.0% in 2000 and, excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000, 17.0%. Excluding Overnite, the Corporations operating margin was 18.6% in 2001 compared to 17.2% in 2000 and, excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000, 18.3%. RAIL SEGMENT NET INCOME Rail operations reported net income of $1.1 billion in 2001 compared to net income of $926 million in 2000, up 14%. Excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000, net income was $998 million. The increase in earnings resulted from higher commodity revenue and real estate sales combined with lower fuel expense, interest expense and materials and supplies expense. These improvements were partially offset by inflation, lower other revenue and higher equipment rent and depreciation expenses. 22 OPERATING REVENUES Rail operating revenues increased $69 million (1%) over 2000 to $10.8 billion. Revenue carloads were flat with an increase in the energy and agricultural commodity groups offset by decreases in the other four commodity groups. The decrease in other revenue was the result of lower switching, subsidiary and accessorial revenues. The following tables summarize the year over year changes in rail commodity revenue, revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type: Commodity Revenue in Millions of Dollars 2001 2000 Change Agricultural ............................................... $ 1,454 $ 1,400 4% Automotive ................................................. 1,118 1,182 (5) Chemicals .................................................. 1,545 1,640 (6) Energy ..................................................... 2,399 2,154 11 Industrial Products ........................................ 1,970 1,985 (1) Intermodal ................................................. 1,905 1,909 Total ...................................................... $ 10,391 $ 10,270 1% Revenue Carloads in Thousands 2001 2000 Change Agricultural ............................................... 876 873 % Automotive ................................................. 763 815 (6) Chemicals .................................................. 879 936 (6) Energy ..................................................... 2,161 1,930 12 Industrial Products ........................................ 1,405 1,431 (2) Intermodal ................................................. 2,832 2,916 (3) Total ...................................................... 8,916 8,901 % Average Revenue Per Car 2001 2000 Change Agricultural................................................ $ 1,660 $ 1,604 3% Automotive.................................................. 1,465 1,450 1 Chemicals................................................... 1,756 1,752 Energy...................................................... 1,111 1,116 Industrial Products......................................... 1,402 1,387 1 Intermodal.................................................. 673 655 3 Total....................................................... $ 1,165 $ 1,154 1% Agricultural Revenue increased 4%, due primarily to a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Carloads were flat, as higher corn shipments and meals and oils exports were offset by a decrease in demand for domestic and export wheat shipments and a poor sugar beet harvest. Revenue gains were also achieved through increased beer imports from Mexico, wine shipments from California to eastern markets, express service of fresh and frozen products and increased demand for cottonseed. Average revenue per car increased due to a longer average length of haul, resulting from fewer short haul wheat and sweetener shipments combined with increased long haul domestic and Mexico corn shipments. Automotive Revenue declined 5% as a result of a 6% decrease in carloads and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Materials volumes declined 16%, as the soft economy and a decline in vehicle sales led to high inventories, low industry production and auto plant shutdowns. Total finished vehicle shipments declined only 1%, as industry weakness was mitigated by market share gains. Consumer incentives in the fourth quarter stimulated vehicle sales and helped offset weakness early in the year. Average revenue per car increased due to a shift in mix of materials shipped, resulting from fewer shipments of materials with lower average revenue per car. Additionally, more materials were shipped in boxcars rather than containers, which yield higher average revenue per car than containers. Chemicals Revenue declined 6%, due to a 6% decrease in carloads. Volume declines were the result of the soft economy, as reduced demand for consumer durables led to high manufacturer inventories and weak demand for plastics. Reduced industrial manufacturing also depressed demand for liquid and dry chemicals. Fertilizer and phosphate rock revenues decreased as high energy costs early in the year reduced the market for these commodities. Average revenue per car was flat, as the positive impact of fewer low average revenue per car phosphate rock shipments was offset by a decrease in average revenue per car for soda ash shipments. 23 Energy Energy commodity revenue increased 11% compared to 2000, due to a 12% increase in carloads. Records were set in 2001 for total carloads, revenue and coal trains loaded per day in the Southern Powder River Basin in Wyoming and in the coal mining regions of Colorado and Utah. These increases were driven by strong utility demand caused by severe winter weather in late 2000 and the first quarter of 2001. In the first half of the year, demand for coal also increased due to the high cost of alternative fuels, such as natural gas, fuel oil and higher priced eastern sourced coal. Carloads also increased due to gains in market share. Industrial Products Revenue decreased 1%, as a 2% decline in carloads was partially offset by a 1% increase in average revenue per car. The decline was mainly the result of the economic slowdown, which had a negative effect on many economically sensitive commodities including steel and paper markets. Steel producers were additionally impacted by high levels of low cost imported steel, which forced plant shutdowns and bankruptcies. Newsprint and fiber revenue declined due to lack of demand for printed advertising. Partially offsetting these declines were increases in construction related commodities, led by stone and cement, as strong building and road construction activity continued in the South and Southwestern regions of the country. Lumber volumes increased due to strong housing construction and uncertainty surrounding restrictions on Canadian lumber imports. Average revenue per car increased due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul business. These gains were partially offset by the impact of increased shipments of stone, which generates lower average revenue per car. Intermodal Revenue was flat, as a 3% decline in carloads was offset by a 3% increase in average revenue per car. The volume decrease was primarily the result of soft economic demand for domestic shipments. In addition, the voluntary action of shedding low margin trailer business in favor of higher margin containers contributed to the decline. Partially offsetting the domestic declines were increases in international shipments, the result of higher import demand. The increase in average revenue per car was primarily the result of price increases. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses decreased $109 million (1%) to $8.7 billion in 2001. Excluding the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, operating expenses were essentially flat. Higher expenses as a result of inflation, higher equipment rents expense and depreciation were offset by savings from lower force levels, productivity gains and cost control efforts and lower fuel prices. Salaries, Wages and Employee Benefits Salaries, wages and employee benefits decreased $83 million (2%) in 2001 to $3.5 billion. Excluding the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, salaries, wages and employee benefits expense increased $32 million (1%). The primary driver of the increase was wage and employee benefits inflation. A 3% gross ton mile increase also added volume costs. A 4% reduction in employee force levels as a result of the work force reduction plan offset a significant portion of these higher costs. Equipment and Other Rents Expenses increased $32 million (3%) compared to 2000 due primarily to higher locomotive lease expense and longer car cycle times. The higher locomotive lease expense is due to the Railroads increased leasing of new, more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives. These new locomotives replaced older, non leased models in the fleet, which helped reduce expenses for depreciation, labor, materials and fuel during the year. The increase in car cycle times is partially attributable to a decline in automotive shipments earlier in the year, which resulted in excess freight cars being stored at assembly plants and unloading facilities. Partially offsetting the increases in expenses were lower volume costs, lower car leases and lower prices for equipment. The decrease in volume costs was attributable to a decline in carloads in commodity groups such as industrial products and intermodal that utilize a high percentage of rented freight cars. Depreciation Depreciation expense increased $31 million (3%) over 2000, resulting from capital spending in recent years. Capital spending totaled $1.7 billion in 2001 and in 2000 and $1.8 billion in 1999. Fuel and Utilities Expenses decreased $30 million (2%). The decrease was driven by lower fuel prices and a record low fuel consumption rate, as measured by gallons consumed per thousand gross ton miles. Fuel prices averaged 88 cents per gallon in 2001 compared to 90 cents per gallon in 2000, including taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads of 17 cents and 13 cents in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Railroad hedged approximately 32% of its fuel consumption for the year, which increased fuel costs by $20 million. As of December 31, 2001, expected fuel consumption for 2002 is 44% hedged at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and for 2003 is 5% hedged at 56 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads (see note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). 24 Materials and Supplies Expenses decreased $71 million (13%), reflecting locomotive overhaul reductions and productivity improvements and cost control measures. Locomotive overhauls decreased due to acquisition of new, more reliable locomotives during the year and the sale of older units, which required higher maintenance. Materials and supplies expenses related to car maintenance also declined due to lower business levels in the industrial products and automotive commodity groups. The cars utilized in these commodity groups normally require more maintenance than the cars utilized within the other commodity groups. Casualty Costs Costs increased $9 million (3%) compared to 2000, as higher insurance, bad debt and environmental expenses were partially offset by lower personal injury costs and lower costs for damaged freight cars. Other Costs Expenses increased $3 million (flat) compared to 2000 primarily due to higher state and local taxes. OPERATING INCOME Operating income increased $178 million (9%) to $2.1 billion. Excluding the $115 million work force reduction charge in 2000, operating income increased $63 million (3%) in 2001. The operating margin for 2001 was 19.3%, compared to 17.7% in 2000. Excluding the work force reduction charge, the operating margin for 2000 was 18.8%. NON OPERATING ITEMS Non operating expense decreased $56 million (12%) compared to 2000. Real estate sales and net other income increased $48 million (38%). Interest expense decreased $8 million (1%) as a result of lower weighted average debt levels in 2001. Income taxes increased $102 million (20%) in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the work force reduction charge in 2000, income tax expense increased $59 million (11%). The increase was a result of higher pre tax income levels in 2001 and an increase in the effective tax rate from 35.6% in 2000 to 36.7% in 2001. TRUCKING SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUES In 2001, trucking revenues rose $30 million (3%) to $1,143 million. The growth resulted from rate increases, new services and $10 million in incremental revenue due to the acquisition of Motor Cargo. Tonnage for the year was flat compared to 2000. OPERATING EXPENSES Trucking operating expenses rose $29 million (3%) to $1,089 million in 2001. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $40 million (6%) due to a 4% increase in employees as well as wage and benefit inflation and enhancements. Fuel and utilities costs decreased $5 million (7%), as a result of lower fuel prices during the year (82 cents per gallon average in 2001 compared to 90 cents per gallon average in 2000, including transportation costs and regional pricing spreads, and excluding taxes), partially offset by a 1% increase in gallons consumed. Overnite did not hedge any fuel volume for the year ended December 31, 2001. However, as of December 31, 2001, Overnite had hedged approximately 16% of its expected fuel consumption for 2002 at an average of 58 cents per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads and had hedged approximately 5% of its expected fuel consumption for 2003 at an average of 58 cents per gallon excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. Equipment and other rents decreased $4 million (4%) due to decreased use of contract transportation during the year. High utilization of contract transportation in 2000 was necessary due to the Teamsters related work stoppage. Casualty costs increased $7 million (18%) due to higher bad debt, insurance and cargo loss and damage expenses. Other costs decreased $11 million (10%) due to lower expenses related to decreased security (related to Teamsters matters), legal and employee travel expenses in 2001. OPERATING INCOME Trucking operations generated operating income of $54 million in 2001, compared to $53 million for 2000. The operating ratio increased to 95.3%, compared to 95.2% in 2000. OTHER PRODUCT LINES OTHER Operating losses increased $10 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Operating revenues declined $4 million year over year. Operating expenses increased $6 million due to increased spending at the technology companies to develop new products and services. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2002, the Corporations principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, the sale of receivables, and revolving credit facilities, as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. The Corporation had $1.875 billion of credit facilities available, of which there were no borrowings 25 outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating. If the Corporations bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the Corporation. Receivables sold as of December 31, 2002 were $600 million. Access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of the Corporations operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact the Corporations ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity. Liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on the financial stability of the Corporation. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash from operations was $2.3 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase from 2001 to 2002 is the result of higher net income, partially offset by pension plan funding. The decrease from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to the timing of large cash payments, including the payments for the work force reduction plan in 2001. Cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2002 and in 2001 and $1.6 billion in 2000. The amount remained essentially flat from 2001 to 2002 as higher real estate sales, a warranty refund from a vendor and a dividend from an affiliate in 2002 were offset by higher capital spending. The decrease from 2000 to 2001 was due to reduced capital spending and higher asset sales in 2001, partially offset by the receipt of cash dividends in 2000. The following table details capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Capital Expenditures Millions 2002 2001 2000 Track .................................................... $1,200 $1,125 $1,066 Locomotives .............................................. 187 176 250 Freight cars ............................................. 11 27 55 Facilities and other ..................................... 489 408 412 Total .................................................... $1,887 $1,736 $1,783 Cash used in financing activities was $473 million, $440 million and $486 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase from 2001 to 2002 reflects lower financings ($775 million in 2002 versus $925 million in 2001), partly offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($150 million in 2002 versus $52 million in 2001). The decrease from 2000 to 2001 reflects higher financings in 2001 ($925 million in 2001 versus $506 million in 2000) and an increase in stock option proceeds ($52 million in 2001 versus $3 million in 2000), partially offset by higher debt repayments ($1.2 billion in 2001 versus $796 million in 2000). Including the convertible preferred securities (see note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8) as an equity instrument, the ratio of debt to total capital employed was 38.8%, 42.2% and 45.1% at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, the Corporations ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 3.9, 3.0 and 2.5, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent net income less equity in undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, as referenced in the tables below, the Corporation has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect the financial condition of the Corporation. However, based on managements assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the Corporation, including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporations consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, the commercial obligations, financings and commitments made by the Corporation are customary transactions which are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations, particularly within the transportation industry. 26 The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Less Than After Millions of Dollars Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Debt (note 5)[a] ....................... $ 6,194 $ 169 $ 1,144 $ 1,259 $ 3,622 Operating leases (note 6) .............. 3,301 444 761 577 1,519 Capital lease obligations (note 6) ..... 2,446 210 407 360 1,469 Unconditional purchase obligations (note 10)[b] ........................ 404 224 180 Total contractual obligations .......... $12,345 $ 1,047 $ 2,492 $ 2,196 $ 6,610 [a] Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,458 million and market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges that are recorded as assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. [b] Unconditional purchase obligations represent multi year contractual commitments to purchase assets at fixed prices and fixed volumes. These commitments are made in order to take advantage of pricing opportunities and to insure availability of assets to meet quality and operational requirements. Excluded are annual contracts made in the normal course of business for performance of routine services, as well as commitments where contract provisions allow for cancellation. Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Other Commercial Commitments Amounts Less Than After Millions of Dollars Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Credit facilities (note 5) ................ $ 1,875 $ 875 $ 1,000 $ $ Convertible preferred securities (note 5) 1,500 1,500 Sale of receivables (note 2) .............. 600 600 Guarantees (note 10)[a] ................... 368 14 22 13 319 Standby letters of credit (note 10) ....... 76 69 7 Total commercial commitments .............. $ 4,419 $ 1,558 $ 1,029 $ 13 $ 1,819 [a] Includes guaranteed obligations of affiliated operations. FINANCING ACTIVITIES CREDIT FACILITIES The Corporation had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2002. Commercial paper is issued from time to time for working capital needs and is supported by $1.875 billion in credit facilities, of which $875 million expires in March 2003, with the remaining $1.0 billion expiring in 2005. The credit facility for $875 million includes $825 million that was entered into during March 2002 and $50 million entered into during June 2002. The $1.0 billion credit facility was entered into during March 2000. The Corporation has the option to hold higher cash balances in addition to or in replacement of the credit facilities to support commercial paper. These credit facilities also allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR based) rates, plus a spread, depending upon the Corporations senior unsecured debt ratings. The credit facilities are designated for general corporate purposes, and none of the credit facilities were used as of December 31, 2002. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers. The Corporation is reviewing rollover options for the credit facility that expires in March 2003. SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT During January 2002, under an existing shelf registration statement, the Corporation issued $300 million of 6 1/8% fixed rate debt with a maturity of January 15, 2012. The proceeds from the issuance were used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes. In April 2002, the Corporation called its $150 million, 8 5/8% debentures due May 15, 2022 for redemption in May 2002. The Corporation issued $350 million of 6 1/2% fixed rate debt with a maturity of April 15, 2012, in order to fund the redemption. The Corporation used the remaining proceeds to repay other debt and for other general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2002, the Corporation issued the remaining $50 million of debt under the existing shelf registration statement. The debt carries a fixed rate of 5 3/4% with a maturity of October 15, 2007. The proceeds from the issuance were used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes. 27 The Corporation filed a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement, which became effective in July 2002. Under the shelf registration statement, the Corporation may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. At December 31, 2002, the Corporation had $1.0 billion remaining for issuance under the shelf registration. The Corporation has no immediate plans to issue equity securities. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FINANCINGS During June 2002, UPRR entered into a capital lease covering new locomotives. The related capital lease obligation totaled approximately $126 million and is included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as debt (see note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). In December 2001, the Railroad entered into a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building, which will be constructed in Omaha, Nebraska. The expected completion date of the building is mid 2004. It will total approximately 1.1 million square feet with approximately 3,800 office workspaces. The cost to construct the new headquarters, including capitalized interest, is approximately $260 million. The Corporation has guaranteed all of the Railroads obligation under this lease. UPRR is the construction agent for the lessor during the construction period. The Railroad has guaranteed, in the event of a loss caused by or resulting from its actions or failures to act as construction agent, 89.9% of the building related construction costs incurred up to that point during the construction period. Total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding commitments as of December 31, 2002, were approximately $50 million. Accordingly, the Railroads guarantee at December 31, 2002, was approximately $45 million. As construction continues and additional costs are incurred, this guarantee will increase accordingly. After construction is complete, UPRR will lease the building under an initial term of five years with provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to agreement between the Railroad and lessor. At any time during the lease, the Railroad may, at its option, purchase the building at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building. If the Railroad elects not to purchase the building or renew the lease, the building is returned to the lessor for remarketing, and the Railroad has guaranteed a residual value equal to 85% of the total construction related costs. The guarantee will be approximately $220 million. OTHER MATTERS PERSONAL INJURY AND OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS The cost of injuries to employees and others related to Railroad activities or in accidents involving the trucking segment is charged to expense based on actuarial estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. During 2002, the Railroads reported number of work related injuries that resulted in lost job time decreased 5% compared to the number of injuries reported during 2001, and accidents at grade crossings decreased 16% compared to 2001. Annual expenses for the Corporations personal injury related events were $259 million in 2002, $227 million in 2001 and $226 million in 2000. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Corporation had a liability of $724 million and $743 million, respectively, accrued for future personal injury costs, of which $304 million and $295 million were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs. The Railroad has additional amounts accrued for claims related to certain occupational illnesses. Compensation for Railroad work related accidents is governed by the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements. The Railroad offers a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS The Corporation generates and transports hazardous and non hazardous waste in its current and former operations, and is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The Corporation has identified approximately 433 sites at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 52 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 27 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, the Corporations ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site. When an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned, leased or otherwise used in the conduct of the Corporations business, the Corporation and its consultants perform environmental assessments on such property. The Corporation expenses the cost of the assessments as incurred. The Corporation accrues the cost of remediation where its obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. 28 As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Corporation had a liability of $189 million and $172 million, respectively, accrued for future environmental costs, of which $72 million and $71 million were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as for ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws and regulations. The Corporation believes that it has adequately accrued for its ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability. However, the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and or the speculative nature of remediation costs. The Corporation expects to pay out the majority of the December 31, 2002, environmental liability over the next five years, funded by cash generated from operations. Remediation of identified sites previously used in operations, used by tenants or contaminated by former owners required cash spending of $68 million in 2002, $63 million in 2001, and $62 million in 2000. The Corporation is also engaged in reducing emissions, spills and migration of hazardous materials, and spent cash of $6 million, $5 million and $8 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, for control and prevention. In 2003, the Corporation anticipates spending $65 million for remediation and $9 million for control and prevention. The impact of current obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of the Corporation. LABOR MATTERS Rail Approximately 87% of the Railroads nearly 47,000 employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. National negotiations under the Railway Labor Act to revise the national labor agreements for all crafts began in late 1999. In May 2001, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE) ratified a five year agreement, which included provisions for an annual wage increase (based on the consumer price index) and progressive health and welfare cost sharing. In August 2002, the carriers reached a five year agreement with the United Transportation Union (UTU) for annual wage increases as follows: 4.0% July 2002, 2.5% July 2003, and 3.0% July 2004. The agreement also established a process for resolving the health and welfare cost sharing issue through arbitration and also provided for the operation of remote control locomotives by trainmen. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) challenged the remote control feature of the UTU Agreement and a recent arbitration decision held that operation of remote control by UTU members in terminals does not violate the BLE agreement. In November 2002, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Blacksmiths (IBB) reached a five year agreement following the UTU wage pattern. In January 2003, an arbitration award was rendered establishing wage increases and health and welfare employee cost sharing for the Transportation Communications International Union (TCU). Contract discussions with the remaining unions are either in negotiation or mediation. Also during 2002, the National Mediation Board ruled against the UTU on its petition for a single operating craft on the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The BLE is now working on a possible merger with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters). Trucking During 2002, OTC continued to oppose the efforts of the Teamsters to unionize OTC service centers. On February 11, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting as a full panel, refused to enforce four bargaining orders issued by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that would have required OTC to bargain with the Teamsters, even though the Teamsters lost secret ballot elections. Subsequently, the NLRB moved for a judgment against itself to reverse the seven other bargaining orders it had issued, and the Fourth Circuit entered that judgment. On October 11, 2002, the NLRBs General Counsel dismissed a charge the Teamsters had filed in August 2001 alleging that OTC had been bargaining in bad faith. OTC has not reached any collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters. On October 24, 2002, the Teamsters ended the national strike they had called against OTC three years earlier. The Teamsters eight year campaign to organize OTCs service centers has become almost entirely dormant, and since October 2002, the Teamsters have lost rights to represent 41% of the approximately 2,100 employees they had organized. The Teamsters had become the bargaining representative of the employees at 26 of OTCs 170 service centers, but the employees at 17 of these locations recently have voted to decertify the Teamsters, and the NLRB has officially approved the votes in 14 of those locations. Decertification petitions are pending at four other service centers. Only a single representation petition currently is pending, but due to strike violence charges pending against the Teamsters, the NLRB has blocked the Teamsters efforts to precipitate an election. In all, the Teamsters currently represent approximately 10% of OTCs 12,534 employees. Employees at two Motor Cargo service centers located in North Salt Lake, Utah and Reno, Nevada, representing approximately 11% of Motor Cargos total work force at 33 service centers, are covered by two separate collective bargaining 29 agreements with unions affiliated with the Teamsters. Although the agreements cover most of the employees at these two facilities, less than half of these covered employees are actual members of unions. INFLATION The cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies such as the Railroad, OTC and Motor Cargo. As a result, depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis, assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels, would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Corporation and its subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve the Corporations interest rate objectives. The Corporation uses swaps, futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and hedge the exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements. The Corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. The purpose of these programs is to protect the Corporations operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations. The Corporation may also use swaptions to secure near term swap prices. Swaptions are swaps that are extendable past their base period at the option of the counterparty. Swaptions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market through the Consolidated Statements of Income. Market and Credit Risk The Corporation addresses market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying item being hedged. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2002, the Corporation has not been required to provide collateral, nor has UPC received collateral relating to its hedging activities. In addition, the Corporation enters into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral. The collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor. The Corporation generally is not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults. Determination of Fair Value The fair values of the Corporations derivative financial instrument positions at December 31, 2002 and 2001, were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) or swap spread. Sensitivity Analyses The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on the Corporations financial instruments. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results. Interest Rates The Corporation manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within its debt portfolio over a given period. The mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required. Derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, the Corporation also obtains flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within its debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Corporation had variable rate debt representing approximately 12% of its total debt. If variable interest rates average 10% higher in 2003 than the Corporations December 31, 2002 variable rate, which was approximately 3%, the Corporations interest expense would increase by less than $5 million after tax. If variable interest rates had averaged 10% higher in 2002 than the Corporations December 31, 2001 variable rate, the Corporations interest expense would have increased by less than $5 million after tax. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of the Corporations variable rate debt at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Swaps allow the Corporation to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). The swaps have been accounted for using the short cut method as allowed by Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 133; therefore, no ineffectiveness has been 30 recorded within the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2002, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap on $250 million of debt with a maturity date of December 2006. In May 2002, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap on $150 million of debt with a maturity date of February 2023. This swap contained a call option that matches the call option of the underlying hedged debt, as allowed by FAS 133. In January 2003, the swaps counterparty exercised their option to cancel the swap, effective February 1, 2003. Similarly, the Corporation has exercised its option to redeem the underlying debt. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Corporation had approximately $898 million and $598 million of interest rate swaps, respectively. The effect of a 10% interest rate increase or decrease in 2003 over the December 31, 2002 rates is included in the preceding and succeeding paragraph disclosure, respectively. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2002, and amounts to approximately $203 million at December 31, 2002. Market risk resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2001, amounted to approximately $226 million at December 31, 2001. The fair values of the Corporations fixed rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates. Fuel Fuel costs are a significant portion of the Corporations total operating expenses. As a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical volatility of fuel prices, the Corporations transportation subsidiaries periodically use swaps, futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. The Corporation at times may use swaptions to secure more favorable swap prices. As of December 31, 2002, expected rail fuel consumption for 2003 is 7% hedged at 58 cents per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. As of December 31, 2002, the Railroad has no outstanding hedges for 2004. Based on annualized fuel consumption during 2002, and excluding the impact of the hedging program, each one cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately $8.2 million of additional fuel expense, after tax. As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation had hedged approximately 44% of its forecasted 2002 fuel consumption and 5% of its forecasted 2003 fuel consumption at 56 cents per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. As of December 31, 2002, expected trucking fuel consumption for 2003 is 5% hedged at 58 cents per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. As of December 31, 2002, there are no outstanding hedges for 2004. Based on annualized fuel consumption during 2002, and excluding the impact of the hedging program, each one cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately $400,000 of additional fuel expense, after tax. As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation had hedged approximately 16% of its forecasted 2002 trucking fuel consumption and 5% of its forecasted 2003 fuel consumption at 58 cents per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (FAS 143). FAS 143 is effective for the Corporation beginning January 1, 2003. FAS 143 requires that the Corporation record a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation when the Corporation has a legal obligation to remove the asset. The standard will affect the way the Corporation accounts for track structure removal costs, but will have no impact on liquidity. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. Any impact resulting from the adoption of this statement will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2003. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (FAS 146). FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Management believes that FAS 146 will not have a material impact on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45). FIN 45 is effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were effective for the year ending December 31, 2002, which expand the disclosures required by a guarantor about its obligations under a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires the Corporation to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in the issuance of the guarantee. Management does not believe that FIN 45 will have a material impact on the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure" (FAS 148). FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for voluntary changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation, and amends the disclosure requirements including a requirement for interim disclosures. The Corporation currently discloses the effects of stock based employee compensation and does not intend to voluntarily change to the alternative accounting principle. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. As described in note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, the Railroad has a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building, which falls within the guidance of FIN 46. In accordance with FIN 46, the Railroad will either consolidate, restructure or refinance the synthetic lease prior to July 1, 2003. The Corporation does not expect FIN 46 to have any impact on the treatment of the Sale of Receivables program as described in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES There are various claims and lawsuits pending against the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. The Corporation is also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, pursuant to which it is currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites. A discussion of certain claims, lawsuits, contingent liabilities and guarantees is set forth in note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8. PENSIONS During the second quarter of 2002, the Corporation decreased its assumed rate of return on pension plan assets from 10% to 9%. This assumption change resulted in an increase to 2002 pension expense of $22 million. In addition, due to declines on plan assets, a minimum pension liability adjustment was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2002. This adjustment resulted in a reduction of common shareholders equity. The reduction in equity totaled $225 million, after tax (approximately 2% of total equity). OTC voluntarily contributed $125 million to its pension plan during 2002. The Railroad voluntarily contributed $100 million to its pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2002. The Corporation currently does not have any minimum funding requirements, as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws; however, UPC plans to voluntarily contribute approximately $75 million during 2003. Required contributions subsequent to 2003 are dependent on asset returns, current discount rates and a number of other factors; however, the Corporation expects to continue discretionary funding to help manage any potential required funding in the future. Future contributions are expected to be funded primarily by cash generated from operating activities. DIVIDEND RECEIVABLE The Railroad owns a 26% interest in Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. (GFM). GFM operates a major railway system in Mexico. During the third quarter of 2002, the Railroad recorded a dividend from GFM of approximately $118 million. As of December 31, 2002, the dividend is reflected as a receivable in the Corporations Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The dividend is accounted for as a reduction to investments in and advances to affiliated companies in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2002 and creates no effect on the Corporations Consolidated Statements of Income. During the fourth quarter 2002, the Railroad received approximately $20 million of the dividend receivable, and anticipates it will receive the remainder of the dividend during 2003. WEST COAST PORT DISRUPTION During September of 2002, the labor dispute between the International Longshoreman and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the Pacific Maritime Association escalated and resulted in work slow downs and a lockout of the ILWU dockworkers for four days at the end of the third quarter and continued for nine days into the fourth quarter of 2002. The estimated impact on fourth quarter earnings is approximately 10 cents per share, resulting mainly from international intermodal shipments diverted to trucks and suspended shipments due to vessel scheduling disruptions. RAILROAD RETIREMENT REFORM On December 21, 2001, The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act of 2001 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act was a result of historic cooperation between rail management and labor, and provides improved railroad retirement benefits for employees and reduced payroll taxes for employers. The estimated savings to the Railroad during 2002 from passage of the Act was $36 million, pre tax, in reduced employer payroll taxes. Incremental savings are expected in 2003 as the employer tax rate is further reduced by 1.4 percentage points from 15.6% to 14.2%. 32 WORK FORCE REDUCTION During 2003, the Corporation is planning to reduce approximately 1,000 administrative positions, through a combination of attrition and involuntary severance. The estimated 2003 severance cost is $45 million, pre tax, the majority of which should occur in the first quarter of 2003. A LOOK FORWARD 2003 BUSINESS OUTLOOK RAIL The Railroad expects to build on the positive momentum generated in the past several years and continue to grow revenue, operating income and free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. Year over year revenue growth is projected in all commodity groups with the largest percentage increases projected in the intermodal, agricultural and industrial groups. Revenue derived from chemical and energy shipments is expected to increase steadily over 2003. Automotive revenue is also expected to increase slightly from last years record setting pace, thereby continuing as a strong revenue provider. The Railroad will continue to focus on improving service performance while developing new, innovative rail service offerings to meet the changing needs of its customers. While operating expenses will likely increase for such items as insurance, pension, operating taxes and minimum guaranteed payments to union employees, cost controls and continuing improvements in productivity will remain a focus to drive the operating ratio lower. Fuel price will remain susceptible to near term volatile price swings. To help reduce the impact of fuel price volatility on earnings, the Railroad will continue to look for opportunities to use hedge contracts. TRUCKING Overnite expects financial performance to further improve upon its positive 2002 results. Solid revenue growth is projected, in part due to additional business resulting from the forced closure of Consolidated Freightways. Cost controls and productivity improvements are projected to positively impact operating expenses, which will mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures and volatile fuel prices. Overnite will continue to offer reliable on time performance and quality service, which should enable Overnite to maintain profitable margins. 2003 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS The Corporations 2003 capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations, additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties. The Corporation expects that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet cash requirements in the foreseeable future. In 2003, the Corporation expects to spend approximately $1.8 to $2.0 billion on capital expenditures. These capital expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on the Railroads main lines, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build infrastructure and develop and implement new technologies. OTC and Motor Cargo will continue to maintain their truck fleet, expand service centers and enhance technology.
