Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, and other information included in this report. The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates is our one reportable business segment. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include discontinued trucking operations, consisting of OTC and Motor Cargo, which are subsidiaries of Overnite, Inc., formerly an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UPC. In 2003, we reclassified our trucking operations as discontinued operations. 14 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2003 Highlights Revenue growth We increased operating revenues by 4% year over year to $11.6 billion, the highest level in our history, despite a sluggish economy during the first half of the year. Record revenue levels were achieved in five of our major commodity groups: agricultural, automotive, energy, industrial products and intermodal. The higher revenue was primarily attributable to increased carloads of these commodities, improved average revenue per car and fuel surcharges, and reflects the revenue diversity of our rail franchise, as well as continued focus on our Yield Strategy. The key components of our Yield Strategy are providing premium service for a premium price and achieving a mix of business that maximizes profitability. Free cash flow We generated net free cash flow of $524 million (excluding proceeds from the Overnite IPO). Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, less dividends paid, less non cash financings plus non cash acquisitions. Net free cash flow is free cash flow less cash from the sale of discontinued operations. Free cash flow is considered a non GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G. We believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non GAAP measure): Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,422 $ 2,199 $ 1,865 Cash used in investing activities (856 ) (1,336 ) (1,382 ) Dividends paid (234 ) (201 ) (198 ) Non cash financings (188 ) (126 ) (124 ) Non cash acquisitions 80 Free cash flow 1,144 536 241 Proceeds from sale of discontinued operations (620 ) Net free cash flow $524 $536 $241 Overnite IPO We sold 100% of Overnite through an initial public offering. This resulted in a gain of $211 million (including an income tax benefit of $126 million) in the fourth quarter. We generated $620 million in cash proceeds from the offering. Dividend increase Reflecting our increased financial strength and improvement of our balance sheet, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 30% to $0.30 per share, following an increase of 15% in 2002. Improved balance sheet We significantly improved our balance sheet by redeeming $1.0 billion of Convertible Preferred Securities (CPS) with cash from operations and the proceeds of the Overnite offering. The remaining $500 million of CPS was refinanced with new unsecured debt with comparably favorable terms. Credit rating upgrade The Corporations long term unsecured credit rating was upgraded by Moodys to Baa2, which followed an upgrade by Standard and Poors to BBB in 2002. These upgrades reflect our improved balance sheet and will provide us more flexibility with respect to access to capital markets and meeting our financing requirements. 15 Table of Contents 2003 Challenges Energy prices Energy prices were high throughout the year, increasing our operating expenses by $255 million over 2002. However, our fuel surcharge programs offset about 44% of these higher fuel costs. Our fuel surcharge programs allow us to recover a portion of the increase in fuel expense from customers in the form of higher revenue. Uncertain economy Continued weakness in the U.S. economy, created a very difficult business environment during the first half of 2003. U.S. industrial production in the first half of 2003 was flat compared to the first half of 2002. The second half of 2003 was up 0.6% compared to the second half of 2002. The impact of this early weakness can be seen in our carload volumes. Carloads for the first three quarters of 2003 were flat year over year, with fourth quarter carloads up 4%. Network performance Our network performance and operating efficiency were adversely affected in the third and fourth quarters by a shortage of trainmen and engineers, combined with an expanded summer track maintenance program and fourth quarter record level volumes. Programs have been put in place, which we believe should remedy the situation, including, among other things, hiring and training additional employees and accelerating certain locomotive acquisitions. 2004 Expectations Revenue growth We expect to build on the positive momentum generated during the fourth quarter of 2003, targeting year over year commodity revenue growth of 4 to 6 percent for the full year 2004. We are projecting increases in all of our major commodity groups with the exception of energy, which may be slightly down. We expect the largest percentage increases in the intermodal, automotive and agricultural groups, and we should see steady but more modest increases in revenue from chemicals and industrial products shipments. Energy prices Fuel prices will remain susceptible to price volatility. To help reduce the impact of fuel price volatility on earnings, we will continue to leverage our fuel surcharge programs, and we will continue to adhere to our hedging strategy. Capital spending In 2004, we expect to spend approximately $2 billion on capital expenditures, including capital leases. These expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build infrastructure and develop and implement new technologies. Our 2004 capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations, additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties. We expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected cash requirements. Free cash flow We will continue to focus on free cash flow in 2004, with a target of $500 million. Key historical measures: Millions of Dollars (except fuel prices) 2003 2002 2001 Operating Revenue $11,551 $11,159 $10,830 Operating Income 2,133 2,253 2,018 Free Cash Flow (excluding Overnite IPO)[a] 524 536 241 Fuel Price Per Gallon[b] $0.92 $0.73 $0.88 Capital Expenditures[c] $1,940 $1,820 $1,696 [a] Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities, less dividends paid, less non cash financings plus non cash acquisitions. See discussion of free cash flow above for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities, the most analogous GAAP measurement. [b] Including taxes and transportation costs. [c] Capital expenditures include non cash financings of $188 million, $126 million and $124 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 16 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS We Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers We are subject to competition from other railroads, which operate parallel routes in many of our traffic corridors, in addition to motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges and pipelines. Competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing, as well as place a greater emphasis on the rate charged and the quality and reliability of the service provided. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights of way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation We are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state and local authorities with respect to our railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, as discussed below, and other matters. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Governments may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our business. Also, some of the regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other authorizations, and we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so. We Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters and the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non hazardous waste in our current operations, and we have done so in our former operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by us. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. Although, we have appropriately recorded current and long term liabilities for known future environmental costs, we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Rising Fuel Costs Could Materially and Adversely Affect Our Business Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations. Significant price increases may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by international political and economic circumstances. If a fuel supply shortage were to arise from OPEC production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, higher fuel prices and any subsequent price increases would, despite our fuel surcharge programs, materially affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The Majority of Our Employees Belong to Labor Unions, and Strikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States. Some of these agreements expire within the next two years. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs. We May Be Affected by General Economic Conditions Several of the commodities we transport come from industries with cyclical business operations. As a result, prolonged negative changes in domestic and global 17 Table of Contents economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Severe Weather Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, fires and floods, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities and decreased revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. We Are Dependent on Two Key Suppliers of Locomotives Due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotives, there are strong barriers to entry for new suppliers. Therefore, if one of these suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could realize a significant increase in the cost and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations. We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters. Any material changes to current litigation trends could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. We May Be Affected by Future Acts of Terrorism or War or Risk of War Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001, any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, our ability to raise capital or our future growth. Our rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror, which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or liquidity. Any act of terror, retaliatory strike, sustained military campaign or war or risk of war may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity by causing or resulting in unpredictable operating or financial conditions, including disruptions of rail lines, volatility or sustained increase of fuel prices, fuel shortages, general economic decline and instability or weakness of financial markets which could restrict our ability to raise capital. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverages currently maintained by us could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following are our critical accounting policies that affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. Depreciation The railroad industry is capital intensive. Properties are carried at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group, based on the results of a depreciation study. We are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property, to the Surface Transportation Board for review and approval. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition. The cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five year period. An obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis. 18 Table of Contents Capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets. Capital spending totaled $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, including non cash financings of $188 million. In 2003, we implemented depreciation studies, approved by the Surface Transportation Board, resulting in lower depreciation expense of $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets (effective January 1, 2003), partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets (effective July 1, 2003). For the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation expense was $1.1 billion. Various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property. Due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets, variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by $36 million. If the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by $39 million. Environmental We generate and transport hazardous and non hazardous waste in our current operations and have done so in our former operations, and we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified approximately 417 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 51 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 29 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site. When an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned, leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on such property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as for ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws and regulations. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability. However, the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and or the speculative nature of remediation costs. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recorded environmental expenses of $26 million and $37 million for continuing operations, respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had a liability of $187 million and $188 million, respectively, of which $57 million and $71 million were classified as current. Income Taxes We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based in part upon managements judgments regarding future events. Based on that analysis, we have determined that a valuation allowance is not appropriate at December 31, 2003. 19 Table of Contents Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non union employees through qualified and non qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment with specific reductions made for early retirements. We also provide other postretirement benefits (OPEB). All non union and certain of our union employees participate in defined contribution medical and life insurance programs for retirees. We account for our pension plans in accordance with FASB Statement No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (FAS 87) and our postretirement benefits in accordance with FASB Statement No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106). FAS 87 and FAS 106 require us to make various estimates and assumptions, including discount rates used to value liabilities, expected rates of return on plan assets, salary increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated employee mortality rates and expected future healthcare costs. The estimates we used are based on our historical experience, as well as current facts and circumstances and are updated at least annually. We use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability associated with these benefits. Funded Status The funded status of our pension plans represents the difference between the fair value of pension assets and the present value of pension liabilities (projected benefit obligation, or PBO). The PBO is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future salary increases. The funded status is impacted by actual asset returns and cash funding, as well as a year end discount rate, which is used to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate we use for this purpose is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans expected benefit payments. The OPEB plan is unfunded and funding occurs as claims are paid. The PBO of the OPEB plan is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation, as the present value of OPEB liabilities is not affected by salary increases. The discount rate used in valuing OPEB obligations is equal to the pension discount rate for both 2003 and 2002. The following table presents the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans, as well as the key assumptions that impact the funded status as of December 31, 2003: Millions of Dollars Pension Benefits OPEB Funded status: Fair Value of Plan Assets $ 1,520 $ Projected Benefit Obligation (1,804 ) (543 ) Funded status $ (284 ) $ (543 ) Assumptions: Discount rate 6.50 % 6.50 % Salary increase 3.50 % N/A Health care cost trend rate: Current N/A 9.0 % Level in 2008 N/A 5.0 % 20 Table of Contents The following table shows the estimated impact that changes in the assumed discount rate, salary increase and health care cost trend rate would have had on our projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2003: Increase / (Decrease) in Projected Benefit Obligation Millions of Dollars Pension OPEB Discount Rate: 0.25% increase $(50) $(15) 0.25% decrease 52 15 Salary Increase: 0.25% increase 6 N/A 0.25% decrease (5 ) N/A Health Care Cost Trend Rate: 1% increase N/A $59 1% decrease N/A (49 ) Cash Contributions We follow FAS 87 rules to record the expense and liability associated with our pension plans. However, actual cash funding is governed by employee benefit and tax laws. No cash funding was required for us in 2003. During 2003, we voluntarily contributed $100 million to our funded pension plan. Contributions required subsequent to 2003 are dependent on asset returns and future discount rates. We do not anticipate minimum pension funding requirements in 2004. We voluntarily contributed $50 million in January of 2004 to help mitigate any potential required funding in the future. Future contributions are expected to be funded primarily by cash generated from operating activities. Cash funding for OPEB benefits is based on claims paid. Claims paid, net of retiree contributions, totaled $37 million and $46 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Expected claims for 2004 total $35 million, net of employee contributions. Expense Pension expense for 2003 was $15 million, while we recorded pension income in 2002 of $14 million. OPEB expense for 2003 and 2002 was $43 million and $45 million, respectively. Both pension and OPEB expense is determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits (the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period) and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on pension plan assets (for pension only). With respect to the value of pension plan assets, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a five year period. This practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long term rate of return assumptions. The expected rate of return on assets was 8% for 2003 and 9% for 2002. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized immediately, but are deferred and, if necessary, amortized as pension or OPEB expense. 21 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the estimated impact on 2003 pension and OPEB expense relative to a change in the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate. Increase/(Decrease) in Expense Millions of Dollars Pension OPEB Discount Rate: 0.25% increase $(4 ) $(2 ) 0.25% decrease 1 1 Expected Return on Plan Assets: 0.25% increase (4 ) N/A 0.25% decrease 4 N/A Health Care Cost Trend Rate: 1% increase N/A 10 1% decrease N/A (9 ) Personal Injury and Occupational Illness The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability. Compensation for work related accidents is governed by the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. Annual expenses for our personal injury related events were $250 million and $221 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had a liability of $617 million and $671 million accrued for future personal injury costs, respectively, of which $274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years. We have additional amounts accrued for claims related to certain alleged occupational illnesses. Changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to personal injury and occupational illness cases based on large jury awards and public pressures associated with certain occupational related injuries. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts and Ratios 2003 2002 2001 Income from continuing operations $ 1,056 $ 1,265 $ 934 Income from discontinued operations 255 76 32 Cumulative effect of accounting change 274 Net income 1,585 1,341 966 Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income from continuing operations 4.07 4.78 3.65 Net income 6.04 5.05 3.77 Income from continuing operations as a percentage of operating revenues 9.1 % 11.3 % 8.6 % Return on average common shareholders equity 13.8 % 13.3 % 10.6 % Operating margin 18.5 % 20.2 % 18.6 % Income from Continuing Operations The decrease in income from continuing operations in 2003 compared to 2002 was driven by higher fuel prices, inflation, network costs (including expenses associated with increased volumes), lower gains from real estate sales (2002 asset sales with the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) for $141 22 Table of Contents million pre tax and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) for $73 million pre tax) and debt redemption expenses, which more than offset revenue gains, lower interest expense and productivity improvements. Conversely, the increase in income from continuing operations in 2002 compared to 2001 resulted from double digit operating income growth, lower interest costs, the two large asset sale transactions mentioned previously and tax adjustments of $33 million, reflecting the outcome of income tax examinations for prior years. Operating income in 2002 improved as revenue growth, productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation, increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume. Productivity is measured by both gross ton miles per inflation adjusted expense dollar and gross ton miles per employee. Gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of a loaded or empty freight car by the number of miles hauled. Operating Revenues Operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues. Other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the Railroad, revenue from the Chicago commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of Railroad owned or controlled equipment. We recognize commodity revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. Other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. Operating revenues increased $392 million (4%) to $11.6 billion in 2003 over 2002, following an increase of $329 million (3%) in 2002 over 2001. Commodity revenue increased $378 million (4%) in 2003 and $272 million (3%) in 2002. The increase in 2003 was driven by growth in the Industrial Products, Agricultural, Intermodal and Energy commodity groups, including revenue from our fuel surcharge programs, while the increase in 2002 was a result of growth in the Automotive, Intermodal, Agricultural and Industrial Products commodity groups. Revenue carloads increased 1% and 2% in 2003 and 2002, respectively, while average revenue per car (referred to as ARC) increased 2% to $1,195 in 2003 and was $1,168 and $1,165 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other revenue increased $14 million (3%) in 2003 and $57 million (13%) in 2002, driven by increased passenger, subsidiary and accessorial revenues in both years. The following tables summarize the year over year changes in commodity revenue, revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type: Commodity Revenue in Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Agricultural $ 1,578 $ 1,506 $ 1,454 Automotive 1,216 1,209 1,118 Chemicals 1,589 1,575 1,545 Energy 2,412 2,343 2,399 Industrial Products 2,180 2,035 1,970 Intermodal 2,066 1,995 1,905 Total $ 11,041 $ 10,663 $ 10,391 Revenue Carloads in Thousands 2003 2002 2001 Agricultural 883 875 869 Automotive 820 818 763 Chemicals 888 904 879 Energy 2,187 2,164 2,161 Industrial Products 1,478 1,419 1,412 Intermodal 2,983 2,951 2,832 Total 9,239 9,131 8,916 23 Table of Contents Average Revenue Per Car 2003 2002 2001 Agricultural $ 1,787 $ 1,722 $ 1,673 Automotive 1,484 1,477 1,465 Chemicals 1,788 1,742 1,756 Energy 1,103 1,083 1,111 Industrial Products 1,475 1,434 1,395 Intermodal 693 676 673 Total $ 1,195 $ 1,168 $ 1,165 Agricultural Revenue in 2003 rose 5% due to a 4% improvement in ARC and a 1% increase in carloads following revenue growth of 4% in 2002, resulting from a 3% gain in ARC and a 1% growth in carloads. In 2003, the improvement was driven by higher wheat demand for Gulf exports, in addition to added ethanol shipments resulting from heightened demand for the fuel additive. Revenue gains were also achieved through additional shipments of sugar beets due to a favorable crop in 2003 and canned and packaged foods resulting from additional, longer haul shipments from the west coast. ARC grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments, as well as price increases and fuel surcharges. In 2002, revenues grew due to strong export demand and more shipments to Mexico. Revenue gains were also achieved through increased shipments of cottonseed, ethanol (used as a fuel additive) and frozen french fries. ARC rose due to higher average length of haul, resulting from fewer short haul empty storage moves and corn processor shipments, combined with additional long haul meals and oils and animal feed shipments. Automotive Revenue increased 1% in 2003 as a result of a slight rise in both carloads and ARC following an 8% increase in 2002, which resulted from a 7% gain in carloads and 1% growth in ARC. 2003 revenue growth was the result of additional volume due to market share gains for materials shipments, partially offset by a decline in revenues from domestic manufacturers, as the softening economy weakened demand for finished vehicles and forced production cuts. ARC was up slightly in 2003, as price increases were partially offset by the mix impact of disproportionate growth in materials shipments, which move at a lower ARC than finished vehicles. In 2002, volume growth resulted from market share gains for finished vehicles, where carloads were up 11% despite a decline in U.S. light vehicle sales. Materials shipments declined 1%, due primarily to reduced production in Mexico. Market share gains partially offset the decline. ARC increased as a result of a shift in mix, resulting from increased higher ARC vehicles shipments and a decline in lower ARC materials shipments. In addition, average length of haul for vehicle shipments increased due to mix of business. Chemicals Revenue in 2003 grew 1%, as a 2% decline in carloads was offset by a 3% increase in ARC. Revenue in 2002 rose 2% as a result of a 3% increase in carloads offset by a 1% decrease in ARC. In 2003, reduced plastics volume led the decline in carloads as the soft economy combined with higher input costs caused producers to lower inventories and reduce shipments. Growth of market demand for domestic and export soda ash partially offset the decline. ARC improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves, driven by fewer cars in storage in transit, in addition to price increases and fuel surcharges. Conversely, in 2002, volume rose for liquid and dry chemicals due to relatively higher economic demand from industrial manufacturers. Plastics shipments rose as a result of increased demand for consumer durables. Revenue also grew due to higher domestic demand for fertilizer and demand for domestic and export soda ash shipments. ARC declined during 2002, as a result of changes in customer contract terms. Energy Revenue climbed 3% in 2003 compared to a 2% decrease in 2002. In 2003, strong utility demand due to lower inventories in the last three quarters more than offset the absence of export traffic from the Colorado and Utah mining regions (which Japan is now sourcing from other Far Eastern producers), resulting in a 1% increase in carloads. Fourth quarter carloads were the highest ever from the Southern Powder River Basin and Colorado and Utah mining regions. During 2003, tonnage moved from the Southern Powder River Basin was also the highest ever for us. ARC increased 2%, primarily due to index based contract escalators. Conversely, the 2002 24 Table of Contents revenue decrease was driven by a 3% decrease in ARC. ARC declined due to the impact of contract price negotiations on expiring long term contracts with certain major customers. Increased carloads and coal trains loaded per day in the Southern Powder River Basin in Wyoming were offset by reduced West Coast export shipments originating from the Colorado and Utah mining regions. Industrial Products Revenue increased 7% and 3% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue in 2003 was driven by 3% growth in ARC and a 4% improvement in carloads, which was attributable to government, steel and lumber business growth. The increase in government shipments was driven by movement of military equipment and ammunition in support of the war effort. Lumber positively impacted carloads, as housing starts and low interest rates continue to drive demand. Steel and scrap shipments also increased as the weakening dollar created higher domestic and export demand for U.S. produced steel, augmented by market share gains. ARC rose due to price increases, fuel surcharges and more high ARC lumber moves. Revenue in 2002 was primarily driven by a 3% increase in ARC, augmented with a slight improvement in carloads. Increased lumber shipments were the primary growth driver, due to strong housing construction and greater production in the Pacific Northwest region. Stone shipments grew due to strong building and road construction activity in the South. Higher general demand for paper and newsprint commodities also positively impacted revenues. Reduced shipments of steel and metallic shipments in the first three quarters partially offset these increases. However, steel shipments rebounded in the fourth quarter as new U.S. tariffs made domestic producers more price competitive with foreign producers. ARC improved due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul. Intermodal Revenue climbed 4% in 2003 driven by a 3% increase in ARC and a 1% gain in carloads, which followed a 5% increase in revenue for 2002 on the strength of a 4% gain in carloads. In 2003, carloads were up due to strong imports and improved economic conditions as well as the year over year impact of the labor dispute between the International Longshoreman and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2002. ARC in 2003 improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases. Revenue in 2002 increased resulting from strong import demand, truck conversion and price increases. These gains were partially offset by the ILWU/PMA labor dispute, which had a significant impact on intermodal volumes during the fourth quarter, primarily in October. The slight increase in ARC was the result of price increases, offset by the mix impact of a greater number of lower revenue per car international shipments. Mexico Business Included in the commodity revenue reported above is revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. This revenue grew 2% to $893 million in 2003 compared to a 1% increase to $873 million for 2002. Business growth in 2003 was led by market share gains in auto parts shipments and increased revenue for agricultural products resulting from higher corn and meal exports, as well as increased beer imports. In 2002, shipments increased for agricultural products, chemicals, and industrial products commodity groups. Increased revenue for agricultural products resulted from higher corn and meal exports, as well as increased beer imports. Increased chemicals business consisted of plastics exports, in addition to higher imports and exports of liquid and dry chemicals. Reduced automobile production partially offset these gains resulting in fewer shipments of finished vehicles. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased $512 million (6%) to $9.4 billion in 2003 compared to 2002, following an increase of $94 million (1%) to $8.9 billion in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in 2003 expenses was due primarily to higher fuel prices in addition to wage and benefit inflation and volume related costs, as gross ton miles increased 3% for the year. A 2% reduction in employment levels, combined with lower depreciation expense and cost control efforts partially offset the increase. Cost control efforts are defined as focused actions to reduce discretionary spending and failure costs. Expenses in the third and fourth quarters were also negatively affected by increased crew and asset utilization costs, associated with a deterioration in network fluidity as discussed under Other Matters in this Item 7. The increase in 2002 expenses reflects wage and benefit inflation, higher equipment rents, depreciation expenses and increased purchased services and other costs. These increases were partially offset by a 3% reduction in employment levels, lower fuel prices and cost control efforts. Salaries, Wages and Employee Benefits Salaries, wages and employee benefits were $3.9 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 of $198 million (5%) was driven by the 25 Table of Contents adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (FAS 143), which accounted for $110 million of the increase. Other drivers included inflation, volume related costs (driven by a 3% increase in gross ton miles), protection costs, increased crew utilization costs due to a shortage of available crews and pension expense. Protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employees protected rate of pay. An individuals protected rate is imposed by the Surface Transportation Board for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements in other cases. The increase in 2002 of $108 million (3%) was primarily driven by inflation and volume related costs associated with a 4% increase in gross ton miles. A 3% reduction in employee force levels in conjunction with worker productivity improvements partially offset the inflation and higher volume related costs. Equipment and Other Rents Equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal and locomotive leases; other specialty equipped vehicle leases; and office and other rentals. Expenses decreased $19 million (2%) in 2003 compared to 2002, following an increase of $26 million (2%) in 2002 from 2001. The decrease in 2003 was due primarily to lower rental prices for private railcars, partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense and increased car cycle times driven by higher inventory of cars on the system due to slower network train speed in the third and fourth quarters. Conversely, the increase in expense in 2002 compared to 2001 was driven by higher locomotive leases and volume related costs, partially offset by savings from lower car cycle times. Car cycle time for equipment and other rents is defined as the average number of accumulated days that loaded and empty cars from other railroads spend on UPRRs system. The higher locomotive lease expense in both years is attributable to the Railroads increased leasing of new, more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives. These new locomotives replaced older, non leased models in the fleet, which helped reduce expenses for depreciation, labor, materials and fuel during each year. Depreciation The majority of depreciation relates to track structure, including rail, ties and other track material. Depreciation expense decreased $80 million (7%) in 2003 from 2002 levels, following an increase of $21 million (2%) in 2002 compared to 2001. The 2003 decrease was driven by the adoption of FAS 143 as well as the implementation of depreciation studies approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which resulted in lower depreciation rates in 2003 for certain track assets, partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets. Conversely, capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of depreciable assets, partially offsetting the favorable impact of FAS 143 and the depreciation studies in 2003. The increase in expenses for 2002 compared to 2001 resulted primarily from a higher depreciable asset base. Fuel and Utilities Fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel, utilities other than telephone and gasoline and other fuels. Expenses increased $276 million (26%) in 2003 over 2002 compared to a decrease of $184 million (15%) in 2002 versus 2001. The increase in 2003 and decrease in 2002 were driven by fuel prices, which averaged 92, 73 and 88 cents per gallon in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively (including taxes and transportation costs). The higher fuel price in 2003 contributed $255 million to the increase; however, approximately 44% of these costs were recovered through our fuel surcharge programs and are included in operating revenues. A 3% and 4% increase in gross ton miles in 2003 and 2002 resulted in an additional $25 million and $43 million in fuel expense. Additionally, the Railroad hedged approximately 13% and 42% of its fuel consumption for 2003 and 2002, in accordance with its policy applicable to hedging, which decreased fuel costs by $28 million in 2003 and $55 million in 2002. Materials and Supplies Materials used for the maintenance of the Railroads lines, structures and equipment is the principal component of materials and supplies expense. Office, small tools and other supplies and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included. Expenses decreased by $62 million (13%) in 2003 and $11 million (2%) in 2002. The lower expense in 2003 was primarily driven by costs associated with track removal. Additionally, expense in both 2003 and 2002, decreased due to fewer locomotives repaired, cost control measures and a shift to more contracting of locomotive repairs, which resulted in a corresponding increase to Purchased Services and Other Costs. The 2003 reduction was partially offset by higher costs for locomotive materials, while the decrease in 2002 expense was partially offset by higher costs for freight car repairs. 26 Table of Contents Casualty Costs The largest component of casualty costs is personal injury expense. Freight and property damage, insurance, environmental matters and occupational illness expense are also included in casualty costs. Costs in 2003 increased $57 million (16%) following an increase of $30 million (9%) in 2002. The increase in 2003 was driven by higher personal injury expense, insurance costs due to increased premiums and expenses associated with destruction of foreign equipment. Destruction of foreign equipment expense is incurred when equipment owned by other railroads is damaged while in our possession. Higher personal injury and insurance costs in 2002 were partially offset by lower costs for freight damage and destruction of foreign equipment. Purchased Services and Other Costs Purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, state and local taxes, net costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads, transportation and lodging for train crew employees, trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers, leased automobile maintenance expenses, telephone and cellular expense, employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses. Expenses increased $142 million (15%) in 2003, as a result of higher state and local taxes, increased spending for contract services and joint facility expense. Crew transportation costs and trucking expenses for intermodal containers also increased due to network performance. State and local taxes increased primarily as a result of higher income levels used to assess property taxes. Growth in contract services was primarily driven by higher costs for contracting of locomotive maintenance (referenced in Materials and Supplies) and contract related expenses resulting from the cost of track removal. Joint facilities costs were up due to reduced haulage receipts and increased expenses associated with a new joint facility contract. Expenses increased $104 million (13%) in 2002, as a result of higher state and local taxes, increased spending for contract services and joint facility expense. Operating Income Operating income decreased $120 million (5%) to $2.1 billion in 2003 following an increase of $235 million (12%) to $2.3 billion in 2002. In 2003, revenue growth, productivity gains and lower depreciation expense were more than offset by higher fuel prices, inflation, volume and resource utilization costs. In 2002, revenue growth, productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation, increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume. Non Operating Items Interest expense decreased $58 million (9%) and $68 million (10%) in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The improvement in both years was a result of lower weighted average debt levels, including the Convertible Preferred Securities, of $8,939 million, $9,523 million and $9,979 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, as well as lower weighted average interest rates of 6.4% in 2003, 6.6% in 2002 and 7.0% in 2001. Other income fell $246 million in 2003, following an increase of $163 million in 2002. The reduction in 2003 and increase in 2002 were primarily a result of higher 2002 real estate gains (2002 asset sales to the Utah Transit Authority with a pre tax value of $141 million and the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority with a pre tax value of $73 million). Other income for 2003 was also negatively affected by redemption costs associated with the early retirement of $1.5 billion of Convertible Preferred Securities. Income tax expense decreased $99 million (15%) in 2003 versus an increase of $135 million (25%) in 2002 over 2001. The decrease in 2003 was driven by lower pre tax income, which was partially offset by a tax adjustment recognized in 2002 for prior years income tax examinations. The increase in income tax expense for 2002 resulted from higher pre tax income in 2002, which was partially offset by the tax adjustment previously mentioned. Discontinued Operations Revenues from discontinued operations were $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues for 2003 decreased as a result of the loss of November and December revenues due to the sale of our trucking interest on November 5, 2003. The decrease was partially offset by increased volume, yield improvements and price improvements. The increase in revenues for 2002 was due to volume growth, yield improvements and higher revenue for special services, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices in 2002. Income from discontinued operations was $255 million, $76 million and $32 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Income from discontinued operations in 2003 included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of $211 million, including an income tax benefit of $126 million, while 2002 income included a 27 Table of Contents one time benefit of $34 million as a result of the resolution of certain tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service, which was accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense during the period. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2003, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, the sale of receivables and revolving credit facilities, as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had $1.925 billion of credit facilities available, of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003. The sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Receivables sold as of December 31, 2003 were $590 million. In January 2004, we reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors by $30 million to $560 million, due to a decrease in available receivables at December 31, 2003. Access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity. Liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had a working capital deficit of $367 million and $625 million, respectively. A working capital deficit is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. We maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities. Financial Condition Cash from operations was $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase from 2002 to 2003 is due to working capital performance and cash from the discontinued operations, partially offset by lower income from continuing operations. The increase from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by pension plan funding. Cash used in investing activities was $856 million, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The reduction in 2003 is primarily driven by proceeds of $620 million from the sale of our trucking interest, which was partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales and increased 2003 capital spending. The amount decreased slightly from 2001 to 2002 as higher real estate sales, a warranty refund from a vendor and a dividend from an affiliate in 2002 were partially offset by higher capital spending. The table below details capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (including non cash financings of $188 million, $126 million and $124 million, respectively). Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Track $ 1,224 $ 1,200 $ 1,125 Locomotives 373 187 176 Freight cars 13 11 27 Facilities and other 330 422 368 Total $ 1,940 $ 1,820 $ 1,696 Cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion, $599 million and $484 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase from 2002 to 2003 reflects higher debt repayments of $2.1 billion in 2003 (including $1.5 billion of Convertible Preferred Securities) compared to $1.2 billion in 2002, and higher dividend payments, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises of $66 million. The increase from 2001 to 2002 reflects lower financings ($648 million in 2002 versus $881 million in 2001), partially offset by an increase in stock option exercise proceeds of $98 million and slightly lower debt repayments. 28 Table of Contents We expect to spend approximately $2 billion on capital expenditures in 2004, including capital leases. Our 2004 capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations, additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties. Including the Convertible Preferred Securities as an equity instrument, the ratio of debt to total capital employed was 39.3%, 38.8% and 42.2% at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in our ratio in 2003 is due to the redemption of the $1.5 billion of Convertible Preferred Securities and higher debt levels, partially offset by higher equity levels. The reduction in 2002 is due to lower debt levels and higher equity balances. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 3.2, 3.4 and 2.6, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is based on continuing operations. Earnings represent income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change, less equity in undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. The change in our ratio is due primarily to the changes in our income from continuing operations. Financing Activities Credit Facilities We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Commercial paper is issued from time to time for working capital needs and is supported by $1.925 billion in credit facilities. Our credit facilities include $925 million of 364 day revolving credit facilities expiring in March 2004, and $1.0 billion of 5 year revolving credit facilities expiring in March 2005. We have the option to hold higher cash balances in addition to or in replacement of the credit facilities to support commercial paper. These credit facilities also allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR based) rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The credit facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with these covenants. The credit facilities do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating dependent pricing) or any provision that could require the posting of collateral. The credit facilities are designated for general corporate purposes, and none of the credit facilities were used as of December 31, 2003. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers. We are reviewing rollover options for the credit facilities. To the extent we have long term credit facilities available, we have reclassified certain short term debt on a long term basis. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $324 million and $188 million of short term borrowings that we intend to refinance were reclassified as long term debt. This reclassification reflects our intent to refinance these short term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis through the issuance of commercial paper or new long term financings, or by using the currently available long term credit facility if alternative financing is not available. Redemption of Convertible Preferred Securities During 2003, we exercised our option to redeem the entire $1.5 billion of the Convertible Preferred Securities (CPS). The CPS were issued in April 1998 by our wholly owned subsidiary, Union Pacific Capital Trust, at a price of $50 each and paid quarterly cash dividends at an annual rate of 6 1/4%. The redemption was funded with a combination of cash from operations, the issuance of $500 million of debt in June 2003, and cash proceeds from the initial public offering of Overnite. The $1.5 billion redemption, net of the $500 million debt issuance, will reduce interest expense by approximately $71 million, pre tax, annually and eliminate the dilutive effect of the CPS on earnings per share. Total one time costs incurred in 2003, associated with the redemption, were approximately $45 million and are included in other income. Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings Under a current shelf registration statement filed in 2002, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. During February 2003, under the shelf 29 Table of Contents registration, we issued $250 million of 3 7/8% fixed rate debt with a maturity of February 15, 2009. The proceeds of the issuance were used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes. On June 5, 2003, we issued $300 million of 3 5/8% fixed rate debt with a maturity of June 1, 2010 and $200 million of 5 3/8% fixed rate debt with a maturity of June 1, 2033. The proceeds of the issuance were used to redeem $500 million of CPS on July 7, 2003. In December 2003, we filed a new $1.0 billion shelf registration statement, which became effective December 29, 2003. Under this shelf registration statement, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. At December 31, 2003, we had $250 million remaining for issuance under the 2002 shelf registration and the full $1.0 billion for issuance under the new 2003 shelf registration. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore opportunities in 2004 to replace existing debt and otherwise access capital through issuances of debt securities under these registrations. During May 2003, we entered into a capital lease covering new locomotives. The related capital lease obligation totaled approximately $188 million and is included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as debt. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8, and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. However, based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, the commercial obligations, financings and commitments made by us are customary transactions which are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations, particularly within the transportation industry. The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Millions of Dollars Total Less Than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Debt (note 4)[a] $6,439 $373 $ 1,151 $ 1,281 $ 3,634 Operating leases (note 5) 2,975 439 733 482 1,321 Capital lease obligations (note 5)[b] 2,525 223 398 352 1,552 Purchase obligations [c] 3,456 427 595 462 1,972 Total contractual obligations $ 15,395 $ 1,462 $ 2,877 $ 2,577 $ 8,479 [a] Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,531 million and market value adjustments of $19 million for debt with qualifying hedges that are recorded as assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

[d] None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2003. Sale of Receivables The Railroad has sold without recourse on a 364 day revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable to investors through Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a bankruptcy remote subsidiary. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, UPRI had transferred $695 million and $667 million, respectively, of accounts receivable to the investors. UPRI subsequently sells an interest in such pool to the investors and retains an undivided interest in a portion of these receivables. This retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, UPRI had a retained interest of $105 million and $67 million, respectively. The outstanding undivided interest held by investors of $590 million and $600 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, is sold at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction. These sold receivables are no longer included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. On August 7, 2003, the program was renewed for one year with a capacity to sell to the investors an undivided interest in accounts receivable of $600 million. The amount of receivables sold fluctuates based upon the availability of the amount of receivables eligible for sale and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of receivables available for sale would decrease by $6 million. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the amount of receivables sold would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors have the right to discontinue this reinvestment. The investors have designated the Railroad to service the sold receivables; however, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the servicing fees adequately compensate the Railroad for its responsibilities. The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $10 million, $13 million and $27 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability. Payments collected from sold receivables can be reinvested in new receivables on behalf of the buyers. Proceeds from collections reinvested in the program were approximately $11 billion in both 2003 and 2002. In January 2004, UPRI reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors by $30 million to $560 million, due to a decrease in available receivables at December 31, 2003. Headquarters Building The Railroad has a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building, which is being constructed in Omaha, Nebraska. The expected completion date of the building is mid 2004. It will total approximately 1.1 million square feet with approximately 3,800 office workspaces. The cost to construct the new headquarters, including capitalized interest, is approximately $260 million. We have guaranteed all of the Railroads obligation under this lease. 31 Table of Contents UPRR is the construction agent for the lessor during the construction period. The Railroad has guaranteed, in the event of a loss caused by, or resulting from, our actions or failures to act as construction agent, 89.9% of the building related construction costs incurred up to that point during the construction period. Total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding commitments as of December 31, 2003, were approximately $125 million. Accordingly, the Railroads guarantee at December 31, 2003, was approximately $113 million. As construction continues and additional costs are incurred, this guarantee will increase accordingly. At December 31, 2003, we had a liability recorded of approximately $7 million related to the fair value of this guarantee. After construction is complete, UPRR will lease the building under an initial term of five years with provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to agreement between the Railroad and lessor. At any time during the lease, the Railroad may, at its option, purchase the building at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building. If the Railroad elects not to purchase the building or renew the lease, the building is returned to the lessor for remarketing, and the Railroad has guaranteed a residual value equal to 85% of the total construction related costs. The guarantee will be approximately $220 million. OTHER MATTERS Inflation The cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies. As a result, assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. We use swaps, collars, futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and hedge the exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. The purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations. Market and Credit Risk We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying item being hedged. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2003 we have not been required to provide collateral, nor have we received collateral relating to our hedging activities. In addition, we enter into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral. The collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor. We generally are not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults. Determination of Fair Value The fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) or swap spread. Sensitivity Analyses The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results. 32 Table of Contents Interest Rates We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. The mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required. Derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had variable rate debt representing approximately 10% and 12%, respectively, of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2004 than our December 31, 2003 variable rate, which was approximately 3%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $7 million. If variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2003 than our 2002 annual variable rate, which was approximately 3%, our interest expense would have increased by approximately $8 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). The swaps have been accounted for using the short cut method as allowed by FASB Statement No. 133 (FAS 133); therefore, no ineffectiveness has been recorded within our Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap on $250 million of debt with a maturity date of October 2007. In May 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap on $150 million of debt with a maturity date of February 2023. This swap contained a call option that matched the call option of the underlying hedged debt, as allowed by FAS 133. In January 2003, the swaps counterparty exercised its option to cancel the swap, effective February 1, 2003. Similarly, we exercised our option to redeem the underlying debt. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of approximately $818 million and $898 million, respectively. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2003, and amounts to approximately $573 million at December 31, 2003. Market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2002, amounted to approximately $561 million at December 31, 2002. The fair values of our fixed rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates. Fuel Fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses. As a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical volatility of fuel prices, we periodically use swaps, collars, futures and or forward contracts, as well as our fuel surcharge programs, to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. As of December 31, 2003, collars are in place for 9% of expected fuel consumption for 2004. The collars have a floor of $0.64, a cap of $0.74 and a ceiling of $0.86 per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. As of December 31, 2003, we had no outstanding hedges for 2005. Based on annualized fuel consumption during 2003, and excluding the impact of the hedging program, each one cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately $8 million of additional fuel expense, after tax. As of December 31, 2002, we hedged approximately 7% of our forecasted 2003 fuel consumption using fuel swaps at $0.58 per gallon, excluding taxes, transportation costs and regional pricing spreads. Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the FASB published a revision to FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46) to clarify some of the provisions and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. Under the new guidance, special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied FIN 46 prior to issuance of the revised interpretation. We adopted FIN 46 in June of 2003. The revision did not require us to modify our accounting related to the implementation of FIN 46. 33 Table of Contents Network Performance Our network performance and operating efficiency were adversely affected in the third and fourth quarters by a shortage of trainmen and engineers, combined with an expanded summer track maintenance program and fourth quarter record level volumes. Additional operating expenses were incurred as crew utilization costs and car cycle times increased due to slower network train speed. As discussed under Operating Expenses in this Item 7, labor, rent expense and other costs were affected by our network performance. Programs have been put in place, which we believe should remedy the situation, including, among other things, hiring and training additional employees and accelerating certain locomotive acquisitions. Commitments and Contingencies There are various claims and lawsuits pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites.
