Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A and Critical Accounting Policies and Cautionary Information at the end of this Item 7. The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. The Consolidated Financial Statements in 2003 also include discontinued trucking operations, consisting of OTC and Motor Cargo, which were subsidiaries of Overnite, Inc., formerly an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UPC. In 2003, we reclassified our trucking operations as discontinued operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2005 Results Safety We experienced mixed safety results during 2005. While the overall employee injury incident rate per 200,000 man hours decreased, the lost workday case rate increased by 1%. The number of derailments declined 8%, and associated costs declined 12%. These improvements reflect our use of technology such as train simulators and improved training and testing programs. In the area of public safety, we closed 400 grade crossings to reduce exposure and installed 750 video cameras in locomotives to better analyze grade crossing incidents. The number of grade crossing incidents, however, increased 9% during the year, driven in part by the combination of increasing highway and rail traffic. Commodity Revenue Growth Our commodity revenues grew 11% year over year to $13 billion, the highest level in our history, as continued economic growth led to unprecedented demand for our services. We achieved record revenue levels in all of our six commodity groups, primarily driven by fuel surcharges and better pricing. By year end, we repriced approximately 55% of our business in the current market of significant transportation demand. Although volume increased 1% to record levels in 2005, weather related disruptions limited volume growth. Network Improvement We continued to address the resource shortages that led to operational challenges throughout 2004 by aggressive hiring and training of train crews, along with the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars through both long and short term leasing programs. In 2005, network operations improved in spite of significant weather related challenges. We handled record volumes and maintained velocity by strengthening our operational recoverability. We began implementing the Unified Plan in 2005, streamlining the automotive, manifest, and intermodal transportation plans by eliminating switching and work events. Through the year we reduced our rate of train stops by 16% and achieved a 12% reduction of our car switching rate. Productivity improved, as demonstrated by a 6% lower average terminal dwell time, a 2.5% improvement in car utilization, and a 2.4% decrease in the fuel consumption rate. Additionally, we piloted an operational productivity initiative called CIMS (Customer Inventory Management System). CIMS complements the Unified Plan by reducing the number of cars in our terminals. We also expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to further improve network fluidity, ease capacity constraints, and improve asset utilization. 17 Table of Contents Significant Weather Events In 2005, we faced a year filled with significant weather related challenges: In early January, a massive storm hit California and Nevada. Our rail system suffered significant damage, temporarily closing five of our six routes in and out of Los Angeles. We embargoed traffic to and from Southern California and the Las Vegas area until service could be restored, and we rerouted a number of trains. In May, unprecedented rainfall and snow, combined with accumulated coal dust in the roadbed, created track instability on the SPRB Joint Line. The extensive and ongoing maintenance and restoration program disrupted and reduced shipments beginning mid May and continuing throughout most of the year. In August and September, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the New Orleans and Houston areas. Hurricane Katrina caused minimal damage to our rail system. However, Hurricane Rita impacted 17 operating subdivisions, five classification yards, and the Houston terminal complex. More than 150 of our customers temporarily ceased operations resulting in lost revenue and higher operating expenses. On October 1, a severe storm hit northeastern Kansas. The storm dropped 10 to 12 inches of rain in one day, causing track and bridge washouts as well as erosion damage to four main lines in this region. These major corridors serve as the primary connection to the East and South from the western part of our system. Average train speed and average terminal dwell time for October deteriorated 1 mph and 4%, respectively, from September levels. Fuel Prices Fuel prices increased dramatically in 2005, raising our average system fuel price by 45% and adding $740 million of operating expenses compared to 2004. Fuel prices soared in the latter part of the year, as crude oil prices topped out over $70 per barrel in September, compounded by high diesel conversion spreads and large, regional spreads resulting from refinery shutdowns following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Prices decreased slightly in November and December, but to levels considerably higher than 2004. Although we had no fuel hedges in place in 2005, our fuel surcharge programs helped mitigate the impact of these higher fuel prices. Our fuel surcharge programs allow us to recover from customers a portion of the increase in fuel expense in the form of higher revenue. In addition, our fuel conservation efforts allowed us to handle a 1% increase in gross ton miles while burning 2% less fuel. Free Cash Flow Cash generated by operating activities totaled a record $2.6 billion, yielding free cash flow of $234 million in 2005. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. 18 Table of Contents Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G. We believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non GAAP measure): Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,595 $ 2,257 $ 2,443 $ 2,237 $ 1,886 Cash used in investing activities (2,047 ) (1,732 ) (877 ) (1,374 ) (1,403 ) Dividends paid (314 ) (310 ) (234 ) (201 ) (198 ) Free cash flow 234 215 1,332 662 285 Proceeds from sale of discontinued operations. (620 ) Net free cash flow $ 234 $ 215 $ 712 $ 662 $ 285 2006 Outlook Safety Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, and the public. Our 2006 employee safety program addresses the key drivers of 2005 performance. The large number of new employees and managers will be trained, tested, and participate in quality assurance activities. We continue to apply technology to enhance safety. From a public safety standpoint, we will continue our efforts to upgrade and close crossings, install video cameras on locomotives, and educate the public on crossing safety, along with other activities. We will continue our derailment prevention efforts, emphasizing the use of key factor analysis. Commodity Revenue Growth We expect record revenue levels to continue in 2006 based on current economic indicators, forecasted demand, and the opportunity to reprice 13% of our business. We have established a target for year over year commodity revenue growth over 10% percent. We are projecting yield increases in all of our major commodity groups and we intend to manage total volume growth to 3% in an effort to improve returns. Volume growth is expected to occur in the energy, intermodal, and industrial products commodity groups. Transportation Plan In 2005, we continued to implement the Unified Plan, which streamlined segments of our transportation plan. In 2006, we will continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations and improve network efficiency. We plan to maintain adequate manpower and locomotives, improve productivity using industrial engineering techniques, and improve our operating margins. Fuel Prices We expect that fuel prices will remain high, with crude oil prices hovering in the range of $60 to $65 per barrel throughout the year. To reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings, we will continue to increase the amount of traffic subject to fuel surcharge programs. Capital Plan In 2006, we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion and the net present value of additional long term operating leases to be approximately $500 million. These expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and implement new technologies. Major capital projects in 2006 include expanding double track on the Sunset Corridor; continuing enhancements on the SPRB Joint Line; improving the freight car terminal infrastructure in San Antonio, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Houston; and continuing installation of centralized track control across Iowa. We expect to fund our 2006 cash capital expenditures through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and 19 Table of Contents non operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2005. This focused capital plan will help us improve network velocity and facilitate revenue growth. Financial Expectations We anticipate revenue growth and continued network improvement in 2006, and financial results should exceed 2005 levels. Our expectations include generating diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.80 and improving our operating ratio by 2.5 to 3.0 percentage points compared to 2005. Free cash flow for the year should exceed $300 million. Our free cash flow target reflects approximately $450 to $500 million of higher cash tax payments resulting from the impact of higher cash tax rates and higher expected earnings. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating Revenue Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Commodity revenue $ 12,957 $ 11,692 $ 11,041 11 % 6 % Other revenue 621 523 510 19 3 Total $ 13,578 $ 12,215 $ 11,551 11 % 6 % Operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries, revenue from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenue, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by the Railroad. We recognize commodity revenue on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. We allocate commodity revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. We recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. Commodity revenue improved in all six business groups during 2005, with double digit growth in the agricultural, industrial products, and intermodal commodity groups. Fuel surcharges, price increases, and index based contract escalators, which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indexes, all contributed to higher average revenue per car (ARC). In 2005, our fuel surcharge programs generated $1 billion in commodity revenue, which represents approximately 74% of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price for our fuel surcharge programs (currently, $0.75 per gallon). Although volume grew 1% for the year, the severe weather and maintenance and restoration on the SPRB Joint Line constrained volume growth. The commodity revenue increase in 2004 was driven by growth in the industrial products, intermodal and chemical groups. Fuel surcharges, price increases, and index based contract escalators contributed to the increase in ARC. In 2004, our fuel surcharge programs generated $330 million in commodity revenue, which represented 52% of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price of $0.75 per gallon. ARC improved 3% to $1,236, while revenue carloads increased 2%. Subsidiary and accessorial revenue increased other revenue in 2005, mainly driven by higher volumes. In addition, we generated higher subsidiary revenue due to the acquisition of our joint venture partners interest in Bay Pacific Financial L.L.C. (Bay Pacific), an intermodal equipment leasing entity. Passenger and subsidiary revenue increased other revenue in 2004, although accessorial revenue declined. 20 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the year over year changes in commodity revenue, revenue carloads, and average revenue per car by commodity type. Commodity Revenue in Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Agricultural $ 1,971 $ 1,675 $ 1,578 18 % 6 % Automotive 1,273 1,235 1,216 3 2 Chemicals 1,850 1,719 1,589 8 8 Energy 2,578 2,404 2,412 7 Industrial Products 2,819 2,419 2,180 17 11 Intermodal 2,466 2,240 2,066 10 8 Total $ 12,957 $ 11,692 $ 11,041 11 % 6 % Revenue Carloads in Thousands 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Agricultural 883 883 883 % % Automotive 797 826 820 (4 ) 1 Chemicals 913 935 888 (2 ) 5 Energy 2,178 2,172 2,187 (1 ) Industrial Products 1,509 1,515 1,478 2 Intermodal 3,264 3,127 2,983 4 5 Total 9,544 9,458 9,239 1 % 2 % Average Revenue per Car 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Agricultural $ 2,233 $ 1,895 $ 1,786 18 % 6 % Automotive 1,598 1,496 1,484 7 1 Chemicals 2,026 1,839 1,788 10 3 Energy 1,184 1,107 1,103 7 Industrial Products 1,868 1,597 1,476 17 8 Intermodal 755 716 693 5 3 Total $ 1,358 $ 1,236 $ 1,195 10 % 3 % 21 Table of Contents Agricultural Price increases and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in 2005. Total carloads did not increase from 2004. Carloads of grain products increased during 2005 as we shipped more dry feed ingredients to Mexico and more corn to ethanol producers. Higher demand for ethanol reflects the impact of energy demand, rising crude oil prices, and limited capacity of domestic refineries. Reduced carloadings of sugar beets partially offset the gains. Declining carloads of feed grain and reduced shipments of wheat both contributed to lower whole grain shipments. ARC improvement in 2005 resulted from price increases, fuel surcharges, and the positive impact of a larger percentage of carloads with longer average lengths of haul. Increased demand for dry feed ingredients and domestic feed grains drove the improvement in 2004. Export corn and soybean shipments also posted revenue gains from rising demand for shipments to the PNW. Revenue also increased through additional shipments of export wheat to Mexico and Gulf ports. ARC grew due to a higher percentage of shipments with longer average lengths of haul, as well as price increases and fuel surcharges. Automotive Revenue increased in 2005 primarily due to fuel surcharges and price increases, which also drove ARC improvement. Carloads decreased due to lower shipments of domestically manufactured finished vehicles and automobile parts and materials, reflecting continued weakness in this sector. Increased volume of both finished vehicles, primarily from international shippers, and automotive materials shipments drove revenue growth in 2004. This growth was partially offset by a decline in shipments for domestic manufacturers due to lower production levels and weaker sales. ARC improved slightly in 2004 due to fuel surcharges and the favorable impact of more shipments with longer average lengths of haul. 22 Table of Contents Chemicals Price increases, fuel surcharges, and higher shipments of potash from Canada to Portland via the Eastport, Idaho, gateway for overseas export drove revenue growth in 2005. Declines in liquid and dry chemicals, plastics, and petroleum shipments, in part due to the business interruptions caused by Hurricane Rita, reduced volume. In addition, liquid and dry chemical shipments and plastic shipments were lower due to a weak export market, plant closures for maintenance, and the impact of an agreement with the BNSF for access to certain facilities in the Bayport, Texas area. ARC improved for the year due to price increases and fuel surcharges. In 2004, liquid and dry chemical shipments, led by intermediate chemicals and caustic soda, rose due to overall economic activity. Shipments of soda ash, or sodium carbonate, which is an important raw material for manufacturing, increased due to strong demand in domestic and export markets. An improved economy and a stronger export market led to volume and revenue growth for plastics. Overall, ARC improved due to longer average lengths of haul, increased shipments of high ARC soda ash, and the positive effects of price increases and fuel surcharges. Energy Revenue growth in 2005 reflects higher prices, fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators. Although volume grew in the first quarter, carloads for the year were flat as a result of the maintenance and restoration work on the SPRB Joint Line during the second, third, and fourth quarters, the impact of Hurricane Rita, the Kansas washouts, and temporary outages at mines in Colorado and Utah during the fourth quarter. ARC was higher due to price increases, higher fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators. In 2004, overall volume dropped slightly compared to record levels set in 2003; however, coal originating in Colorado increased 9% due to strong demand for this high BTU coal. Price increases and fuel surcharges drove ARC improvements, which were offset by the impact of additional shorter lengths of haul shipments. 23 Table of Contents Industrial Products Price increases and fuel surcharges generated revenue growth in 2005. In particular, lumber shipments contributed to this growth due to solid pricing gains and fuel surcharges. Revenue from stone shipments increased revenue from construction products due to strong construction demand, larger train sizes, and improved car cycle times. Car cycle time is defined as the amount of time that a car spends on our system measured from the origin of the loaded or empty move until arrival at final destination. Overall carloads were flat compared to 2004. Partially offsetting substantial volume growth of stone shipments were reduced paper moves, primarily newsprint and fiber, and fewer shipments of government materials, steel, and cement, resulting from softening markets, cement shortages in certain markets, and higher inventories. Price increases and fuel surcharges drove ARC increases. Growth in lumber, steel, and non metallic minerals led to higher revenue in 2004. Demand for lumber was driven by higher housing starts and low interest rates. Steel shipments increased as strong global demand limited imports and spurred demand for domestic steel. ARC improved due to price increases, fuel surcharges, and more high ARC lumber moves. Intermodal Revenue in 2005 improved due to strong imports, primarily from China and the rest of Asia. However, business interruptions during the first quarter of 2005 due to the West Coast storm limited full year revenue growth. ARC improved due to price increases, fuel surcharges, and index based contract escalators. Overall economic conditions and an increase in imports from the Far East improved revenue in 2004. Fuel surcharges and price increases contributed to ARC growth. Mexico Business Each commodity group discussed above includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico, which increased 15% to $1.1 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. Revenue growth resulted primarily from price increases and fuel surcharges. Carloads were flat versus 2004, as fewer auto parts, energy, and intermodal shipments offset higher agricultural and industrial shipments. In 2004, revenue grew 9% to $970 million, resulting from increased volume in the industrial products, intermodal, chemical, and automotive business groups, particularly cement, newsprint and wood fiber, liquid and dry chemicals, soda ash, and automotive materials. Revenue generated from agricultural shipments also improved due to higher wheat exports and beer imports. Lower export shipments of corn and feed grains, as well as reduced energy carloads, partially offset the increases. 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Salaries, wages, and employee benefits $ 4,375 $ 4,167 $ 3,892 5 % 7 % Fuel and utilities 2,562 1,816 1,341 41 35 Equipment and other rents 1,402 1,374 1,221 2 13 Depreciation 1,175 1,111 1,067 6 4 Materials and supplies 546 488 414 12 18 Casualty costs 411 694 416 (41 ) 67 Purchased services and other costs 1,312 1,270 1,067 3 19 Total $ 11,783 $ 10,920 $ 9,418 8 % 16 % Operating expenses increased $863 million in 2005 versus 2004. Excluding the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre tax) in 2004, operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 10%. Significantly higher locomotive fuel prices accounted for $740 million of this increase (our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue). Inflation in wages, benefits, materials, and services, as well as a larger workforce, resulted in most of the additional increase. Also driving higher operating expenses were increased contract services and clean up and restoration costs associated with the West Coast storm in January. Higher fuel prices, the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre tax), higher crew and asset utilization costs resulting from slower network velocity, and volume related costs all contributed to higher operating expenses in 2004. Expenses were also negatively impacted by wage and benefit inflation, training expenses associated with hiring additional trainmen, increased depreciation expense, and higher casualty costs. A jury verdict upheld against the Railroad in 2004 for a 1998 crossing accident and a derailment in San Antonio, Texas, increased casualty costs. Slower network velocity and service difficulties, and increased hiring and training efforts added approximately $300 million in operating expenses during 2004. Salaries, Wages, and Employee Benefits Several factors drove higher employment expenses in 2005. General wage and benefit inflation continued to increase expenses, reflecting higher salaries and wages and the year over year impact of higher healthcare and other benefits costs. We also incurred higher expenses for management bonuses in 2005, as executive bonuses were not awarded for 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced. A 3% increase in our workforce and higher demand during the year also contributed to the increases. Additionally, labor expenses, in the form of higher train crew costs and labor incurred for repair and clean up activities, increased due to the hurricanes in the third quarter and the West Coast storm in the first quarter. Reduced severance and relocation costs, increased network efficiency, and reduced training expenses 25 Table of Contents partially offset these increases. Transferring various support personnel to Omaha, Nebraska, resulted in higher severance and relocation costs in 2004. The increase in 2004 also resulted from a number of factors, including higher wages and training expenses associated with hiring additional trainmen, increased crew costs due to slower network velocity, inflation, volume related expenses, and severance and relocation costs. Because we did not award executive bonuses for 2004, lower performance based compensation expense for management partially offset these increases. Lower protection costs also offset these increased expenses. Protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employees protected rate of pay. The STB mandates protected rates for employees adversely affected by a merger, and collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions also establish these rates. Finally, a smaller non transportation workforce yielded cost savings during the year. Fuel and Utilities Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Locomotive fuel expense $ 2,393 $ 1,684 $ 1,221 42 % 38 % Fuel surcharge revenue 1,017 330 112 208 195 Fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel, utilities other than telephone, and gasoline and other fuels. Higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.77 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2005 compared to $1.22 per gallon in 2004, increased expenses by $740 million. A 1% increase in gross ton miles resulted in $8 million of additional expenses. We offset $39 million of these increases with a 2% improvement in our consumption rate in 2005 versus 2004. The Railroad had no fuel hedges in place during 2005, and has none in place for 2006. Gasoline, utilities, and propane expenses increased $37 million in 2005 versus 2004 due to higher prices. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was driven by higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.22 per gallon and $0.92 per gallon in 2004 and 2003, respectively (including taxes and transportation costs), and higher gallons consumed. Higher fuel prices contributed $416 million to the increase; however, we recovered approximately 52% of these costs through our fuel surcharge programs, which were included in operating revenues. The increase in gross ton miles in 2004 drove consumption higher, resulting in an additional $24 million in fuel expense for the year. The Railroad hedged approximately 9% of its fuel usage in 2004, which decreased fuel costs by $14 million. Gasoline, utilities, and propane expenses increased $13 million in 2004 due to higher prices. Equipment and Other Rents Equipment and other rents includes primarily rental expense the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; other specialty equipment leases; and office and other rentals. In 2005, the number of leased locomotives and freight cars increased, resulting in additional lease expenses. Higher carloads also increased 2005 expenses. Improved car cycle times partially offset these increases reflecting increased network efficiency, which lowered our short term freight car rental expense. Expenses increased in 2004 due to carload volume growth and longer car cycle times, resulting in higher expenses for locomotive and car rentals. Higher locomotive expense included additional costs associated with leasing short term, or surge, locomotive power, which is more costly than long term locomotive leases, and the increased leasing of new locomotives. Depreciation The majority of depreciation relates to track structure, including rail, ties, and other track material. A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting higher capital spending in recent years, increased our depreciation expense in 2005 and 2004. 26 Table of Contents Materials and Supplies Materials used to maintain the Railroads lines, structures, and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense. This expense item also includes small tools, office supplies, other materials, and the costs of freight services to ship Railroad supplies and materials. During 2005, materials and supplies expense increased, primarily due to locomotive and freight car maintenance. We used more repair materials to maintain a larger fleet of locomotives, including a growing number of units not covered by warranties. Additionally, we incurred higher costs for car wheel sets, traction motors, and lube oil. Conversely, we incurred lower freight charges for shipping Railroad materials and stationary and office supplies. We incurred higher expenses in 2004 due to increased use of locomotive repair materials required to maintain a larger fleet that includes older units not covered by warranties. We also performed more freight car repairs, incurred higher materials costs, and experienced increased freight charges for shipment of Railroad material. Casualty Costs Personal injury expense, freight and property damage, insurance, and environmental costs are the primary components of casualty costs. Casualty costs in 2005 were lower than the previous year primarily due to higher expenses incurred in 2004 for an asbestos charge, a costly derailment near San Antonio, and a large jury verdict affirmed in 2004 for a 1998 crossing accident. Lower freight and property damage expense and lower costs for destruction of foreign or leased equipment also reduced casualty costs. Conversely, we incurred higher insurance costs and increased costs for third party personal injuries related to long term environmental exposures. In 2004, costs rose due to the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre tax), a costly derailment near San Antonio, and a large jury verdict affirmed in 2004 for a 1998 crossing accident. Partially offsetting these increases were lower insurance expenses and reduced personal injury expense, which resulted from lower than anticipated settlement costs and fewer employee injuries in 2004 than previously assumed. Purchased Services and Other Costs Purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, state and local taxes, net costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads, transportation and lodging for train crew employees, trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers, leased automobile maintenance expenses, telephone and cellular phone expense, employee travel expense, and computer and other general expenses. Expenses decreased in 2005 versus 2004 because we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to Omaha, Nebraska during 2004. In 2005, we experienced higher volume related costs for freight car and locomotive contract maintenance and crew transportation and lodging. Although our intermodal carloadings increased over 4% in 2005, costs for trucking services provided by intermodal carriers remained flat as we substantially reduced expenses associated with network inefficiencies. Higher diesel fuel prices increased sales and use taxes in 2005, which resulted in higher state and local taxes. Other contract services increased in 2005. The 2005 January West Coast storm and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita also contributed to higher expenses in 2005 (net of insurance reimbursements received). In 2004, higher locomotive contract maintenance services, state and local taxes, and relocation costs drove expenses higher. In addition, we incurred increased trucking expenses for intermodal carriers and crew transportation costs due to slower network velocity and additional volume. Non Operating Items Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Other income $ 145 $ 88 $ 78 65 % 13 % Interest expense (504 ) (527 ) (574 ) (4 ) (8 ) Income taxes (410 ) (252 ) (581 ) 63 (57 ) 27 Table of Contents Other Income Other income increased in 2005 largely as a result of higher gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program. In addition, other income in 2004 included income recognized from the sale of a technology subsidiarys assets. Other income improved in 2004 due to higher costs in 2003 associated with premium payments for early retirement of $1.5 billion of Convertible Preferred Securities (CPS) and income recognized in 2004 from the sale of assets of a technology subsidiary. These were partially offset by lower gains from real estate sales in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest Expense Lower interest expense in 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to declining weighted average debt levels of $7.8 billion, $8.1 billion, and $8.9 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Our effective interest rate was 6.5% in both 2005 and 2004, compared to 6.4% in 2003. Income Taxes Income taxes were greater in 2005 due to higher 2005 pre tax income, which was partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense. In our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, we reported that the Corporation had undertaken an analysis of the impact that final settlements of tax liabilities for pre 1995 tax years with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had on previously recorded estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The completed analysis of the final settlements for pre 1995 tax years, along with IRS Examination Reports for tax years 1995 through 2002 were considered, among other things, in a review and re evaluation of the Corporations estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2005, resulting in an income tax expense reduction of $118 million in 2005. Income tax expense decreased in 2004, driven by lower pre tax income, a reduction in the deferred state income tax liability primarily attributable to relocating support operations to Omaha, Nebraska, state income tax credits earned in connection with the new headquarters building in Omaha, and an increase in foreign tax credits resulting from the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On November 5, 2003, we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest. In 2003, revenue and income from discontinued operations were $1.2 billion and $255 million, respectively. Income from discontinued operations in 2003 included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of $211 million, including an income tax benefit of $126 million. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS Railroad Performance Measures We report key Railroad performance measures weekly to the American Association of Railroads, including carloads, average daily inventory of rail cars on our system, average train speed, and average terminal dwell time. This operating data is available on our website at www.up.com/investors/reports/index.shtml. Operating Statistics 2005 2004 2003 % Change2005 v 2004 % Change2004 v 2003 Average train speed (miles per hour) 21.1 21.4 23.6 (1 )% (9 )% Average terminal dwell time (hours) 28.7 30.5 26.8 (6 ) 14 Gross ton miles (billions) 1,043.9 1,037.5 1,018.9 1 2 Revenue ton miles (billions) 548.8 546.3 532.9 3 Average full time equivalent employees 49,747 48,329 46,371 3 4 28 Table of Contents Average Train Speed Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals. In 2005, the West Coast storm, disruptions on the SPRB Joint Line, business interruptions caused by Hurricane Rita, and the Kansas washouts in October hampered efforts to improve our average train speed. In 2004, unprecedented demand for our services and crew and locomotive shortages negatively impacted operational efficiency and average train speed. Average Terminal Dwell Time Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. Lower average terminal dwell time is favorable. The 6% improvement in dwell time in 2005 resulted from strategic network management initiatives and efforts to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers. Record demand levels and operational challenges experienced in 2004 affected network performance including average terminal dwell time. Gross and Revenue Ton Miles Gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton miles are based on tariff miles and do not include the weight of freight cars. In 2005, gross and revenue ton miles grew 1% and 0.5%, in relation to a 1% increase of carloadings. Gross and revenue ton miles increased 2% and 3% respectively in 2004, with 2% growth of carloadings during the same period. The increase in gross and revenue ton miles was also positively impacted by volume growth experienced in the higher density commodity groups of industrial products and chemicals, combined with a minimal increase in automotive carloads, which is a lower density commodity. Average Full Time Equivalent Employees The 2005 increase includes the addition of employees needed to complete increased track repair and replacement programs, more train crew personnel both to handle the increased demand and to improve service, and the hiring of operations management personnel, including an expanded management training program. The 2004 average number of full time equivalent employees increased as we added train crew personnel, who were hired to handle increased customer demand and improve service. These additions were partially offset by increased productivity in the non transportation functions, employee attrition, and fewer employees at our technology subsidiaries. Other Financial Statistics 2005 2004 Change Debt to capital 35.1 % 39.1 % (4.0 ) pt Lease adjusted debt to capital 43.6 % 45.1 % (1.5 ) pt Debt to Capital/Lease Adjusted Debt to Capital Debt to capital is computed by dividing total debt by total debt plus equity. Lease adjusted debt to capital is derived by dividing total debt plus the net present value of operating leases by total debt plus equity plus the net present value of operating leases. We believe these measures are important in managing our capital structure to allow efficient access to the debt market while minimizing our cost of capital. In 2005, our debt to capital ratio improved due to a $715 million reduction in our debt level and an increase in equity resulting from earnings. Our lease adjusted debt to capital improved to a lesser extent due to an increase in the present value of operating leases, which were approximately $3.2 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, using a discount rate of 8%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, the sale of receivables, and our revolving credit facilities, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had $2 billion of credit facilities available, of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. The sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements, including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the 29 Table of Contents program was $600 million as of December 31, 2005. Access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity. Liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a working capital deficit of $1,059 million and $226 million, respectively. A working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. We maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities. Financial Condition Cash Flows Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,595 $ 2,257 $ 2,443 Cash used in investing activities (2,047 ) (1,732 ) (877 ) Cash used in financing activities (752 ) (75 ) (1,406 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (204 ) $ 450 $ 160 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Higher income, lower management incentive payments in 2005 (executive bonuses, which would have been paid to individuals in 2005, were not awarded based on company performance in 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced), and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in 2005. A voluntary pension contribution of $100 million in 2004 also augmented the positive year over year variance. This improvement was partially offset by cash received in 2004 for income tax refunds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2004 driven by lower income from continuing operations, the pension contribution, and cash from discontinued operations recognized in 2003, which were partially offset by working capital performance. Cash Used in Investing Activities Increased capital spending, partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales, increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2005. The comparative increase in 2004 primarily resulted from the beneficial impact of the $620 million received in 2003 for the sale of our trucking interest, which reduced cash used in investing activities in 2003. The permanent financing of locomotives and freight cars under long term operating leases (as referenced in the Operating Lease Activities section in this Item 7) had no impact on investing cash flows during the period as all financings were completed in 2005. Cash Used in Financing Activities The increase in cash used in financing activities results from no cash inflows from the issuance of debt in 2005 (compared to $745 million in 2004) and higher debt repayments ($699 million in 2005 compared to $588 million in 2004), partially offset by higher net proceeds from equity compensation plans ($262 million in 2005 compared to $80 million in 2004). The decrease in 2004 resulted from lower debt repayments of $588 million in 2004 compared to $2.1 billion in 2003 (including $1.5 billion of CPS), partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from equity compensation plans ($80 million in 2004 compared to $216 million in 2003) and higher dividend payments ($310 million in 2004 compared to $234 million in 2003) due to the increase of our dividend rate from $0.99 per share in 2003 to $1.20 per share in 2004. 30 Table of Contents The table below details cash capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, including non cash capital lease financings of $188 million in 2003. There were no non cash capital lease financings in 2005 or 2004. Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 Track $ 1,472 $ 1,328 $ 1,224 Locomotives 89 114 373 Freight cars 9 11 13 Facilities and other 599 423 330 Total $ 2,169 $ 1,876 $ 1,940 In 2006, we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion. Additionally, we expect to enter into long term operating leases for equipment with a net present value of approximately $500 million. These expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and implement new technologies. We expect to fund our 2006 cash capital expenditures through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2005. We expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.9, 2.1, and 3.2, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges. Financing Activities Credit Facilities On December 31, 2005, we had $2 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1 billion under a five year facility expiring in March 2010 and $1 billion under a five year facility expiring in March 2009 (collectively, the facilities). The facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper. Neither of the facilities were drawn as of December 31, 2005. The five year facility expiring in March 2010 replaced a $1 billion 364 day revolving credit facility that expired in March 2005, while the five year facility expiring in March 2009 was put in place in 2004 to replace a five year revolving credit facility that was due to expire in March 2005. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers. These facilities allow for borrowings at floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) based rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with these covenants. The facilities do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral. In addition to our revolving credit facilities, we also had $150 million in uncommitted lines of credit that were unused at December 31, 2005. We established two $75 million uncommitted lines of credit in May and July 2005, which will expire in May and July 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2004, approximately $440 million of short term borrowings that we intended to refinance were reclassified as long term debt. This reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance these short term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis. At December 31, 2005, we did not reclassify any short term debt to a long term basis. Dividend Restrictions We are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities. Retained earnings available for 31 Table of Contents dividends increased to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2005, from $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004. We do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Shelf Registration Statement Under a current shelf registration statement, we may issue any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. At December 31, 2005, we had $500 million remaining for issuance under the current shelf registration statement. We have no immediate plans to issue any securities; however, we routinely consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration, and, therefore, we may issue debt securities at any time. Operating Lease Activities As of December 31, 2005, our contractual obligations for operating leases totaled approximately $4.9 billion. Discounted at 8%, the present value of this obligation was approximately $3.2 billion. The Railroad entered into lease arrangements during 2005 to finance its new equipment acquisition program. In 2005, the Railroad, as lessee, entered into long term operating lease arrangements covering 317 locomotives and approximately 2,900 freight cars. The lessors under these lease arrangements purchased the locomotives and freight cars from the Corporation through various financing transactions that totaled approximately $838 million, with a present value of $690 million. These new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately $1.2 billion, which are reflected in the contractual obligations table as of December 31, 2005. The lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars, in part, by the issuance of equipment notes that are non recourse to the Railroad and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the equipment. Neither the Railroad nor UPC guarantees payment of the equipment notes. The Railroads obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars. If the Railroad elects not to exercise any such options, the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term. On July 8, 2005, the Railroad completed the acquisition of its partners interest in Bay Pacific Financial L.L.C., a joint venture established to assist in the acquisition of containers and chassis for use by the Railroad in intermodal service, for a purchase price of $51 million. As a result of the acquisition, the Railroad owns 100% of the joint venture. Total minimum rental payments for operating leases acquired in the acquisition were $202 million at the time of acquisition. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Commitments As described in the notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. However, based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, the commercial obligations, financings, and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry. 32 Table of Contents The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Millions of Dollars Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After2010 Debt [a] $ 10,082 $ 931 $ 1,034 $ 892 $ 694 $ 608 $ 5,923 Operating leases 4,934 615 517 450 405 359 2,588 Capital lease obligations [b] 2,100 199 179 172 167 147 1,236 Purchase obligations [c] 3,861 706 508 402 394 189 1,662 Other post retirement benefits [d] 479 42 45 46 48 49 249 Total contractual obligations $ 21,456 $ 2,493 $ 2,283 $ 1,962 $ 1,708 $ 1,352 $ 11,658 [a] Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,318 million, unamortized discount of $142 million, and market value adjustments of $(16) million for debt with qualifying hedges that are recorded as assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

[c] Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for locomotives, ties, ballast, and track; and agreements to purchase other goods and services. [d] Includes estimated other postretirement, medical, and life insurance payments and payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years. No amounts are included for funded pension as no contributions are currently required.

[b] $600 million of the facility was utilized at December 31, 2005. [c] Includes guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations. [d] None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2005. Sale of Receivables The Railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, as part of a sale of receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse on a 364 day revolving basis, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors. The total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was $600 million at December 31, 2005. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was $600 million and $590 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by $1,226 million and $1,089 million of accounts receivable held by UPRI at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the value of the interest retained by UPRI was $626 million and $499 million, respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and 33 Table of Contents dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by $6 million. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility. The Railroad services the sold receivables; however, the Railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate the Railroad for its responsibilities. The Railroad collected approximately $13.4 billion and $12.2 billion during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. UPRI used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility. The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $23 million, $11 million, and $10 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability. The investors have no recourse to the Railroads other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad have no recourse to the assets of UPRI. On August 11, 2005, the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364 day period without any significant changes in terms. Guarantees At December 31, 2005, we were contingently liable for $486 million in guarantees. We recorded a liability of $7 million for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2005. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. OTHER MATTERS Inflation The cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements. The purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations. Market and Credit Risk We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities. In addition, we enter into secured financings in which the debtor pledges collateral. The nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor determine the collateral. These arrangements generally prohibit us from selling or repledging the collateral unless the debtor defaults. 34 Table of Contents Determination of Fair Value We determined the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate, LIBOR, or swap spread. Sensitivity Analyses The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results. Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had variable rate debt representing approximately 10% and 9%, respectively, of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2006 than our December 31, 2005 variable rate, which was approximately 7%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $7 million. If variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in 2005 than our December 31, 2004 variable rate, which was approximately 5%, our interest expense would have increased by approximately $8 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debts fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). We accounted for the swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities; therefore, we did not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of $750 million. Market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2005, and amounts to approximately $535 million at December 31, 2005. Market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2004, amounted to approximately $599 million at December 31, 2004. We estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates. Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item affects earnings. In 2004, we entered into treasury lock transactions, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges. These treasury lock transactions resulted in a payment of $11 million that is being amortized on a straight line basis over 10 years, ending September 30, 2014. The unamortized portion of the payment is recorded as a $6 million after tax reduction to common shareholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding. Fuel Cash Flow Hedges Fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses. In 2005 and 2004, our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs. However, we may use swaps, collars, futures and or forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. We hedged 120 million gallons of fuel during 2004 using collars with average cap, floor, and ceiling prices of $0.74, $0.64, and $0.86 per gallon, respectively. At December 31, 2004, there were no fuel hedges outstanding, and we did not have any fuel hedges in place during 2005. 35 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. The statement requires that we recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other share based payments starting January 1, 2006. We adopted the statement on a modified prospective basis, using the Black Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. We expect that the incremental, full year compensation expense in 2006 related to the adoption of the statement will be approximately $13 million for new awards granted after January 1, 2006 and an additional $2 million for the unvested portion of awards granted in prior years. The expense for awards granted after implementation of the statement will be based upon their grant date fair value. The expense for those awards will be based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. That estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of awards to vest will differ from the estimate. The estimate does not materially impact our calculation of compensation expense. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). This interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligations, as used in FASB Statement No. 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement, or both, are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We assessed the impact of the interpretation on our financial statements, determined that we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestos containing materials, and recorded a $5 million liability at December 31, 2005, for the fair value of this obligation. In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. This statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. It carries forward without change the previous guidance for reporting the correction of an error and a change in accounting estimate. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In July 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. As drafted, the interpretation would require companies to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained during a tax audit. However, in November 2005 the FASB voted to replace the probable threshold with a more likely than not criterion when determining if the impact of a tax position should be recorded. The FASB expects to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter of 2006. When it is available, we will review the final interpretation to determine the impact it may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft, Earnings per Share, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 128. The draft clarifies guidance for the treasury stock method, contracts that may be settled in cash or shares, and contingently issuable shares. The FASB expects to issue a final statement in the first quarter of 2006. We are currently reviewing this proposed exposure draft to determine the impact it may have on our calculation of earnings per share. In December 2005, the FASB deliberated issues relating to the limited scope, first phase of its project to reconsider the accounting for postretirement benefits, including pensions. The FASB decided that the objectives and scope of this phase include, among other items, recognizing the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or a liability in the statement of financial position. The FASB expects to issue an exposure draft for the initial phase in the first quarter of 2006. In the second multi year phase of the project, the FASB expects to comprehensively consider a variety of issues related to the accounting for postretirement benefits, including expense recognition, obligation measurement, and whether postretirement benefit trusts should be consolidated by the plan sponsor. We will review the proposed standards when they are available to determine the impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in the notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. Asbestos We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos. Additionally, we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated. A liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestos related claims through 2034 has been estimated and recorded. During 2004, we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions: The number of claims received in 2005 will be consistent with average claims received between 2000 and 2003. The number of claims to be filed against us will decline each year after 2005. The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to those experienced between 2002 and 2004. The percentage of claims dismissed between 2002 and 2004 will continue through 2034. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $311 million and $324 million, respectively, was classified as liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, of which $16 million and $17 million, respectively, was classified as current accrued casualty costs. Approximately 16% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84% related to unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 29 years. We have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos related claims, and we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries. Our asbestos related claims activity was as follows: Claims Activity 2005 2004 2003 Open claims, beginning balance 2,316 2,560 1,541 New claims 741 474 1,612 Settled or dismissed claims (622 ) (718 ) (593 ) Open claims, ending balance at December 31 2,435 2,316 2,560 37 Table of Contents We believe that our liability for asbestos related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates. The amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment, federal and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants, and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants. Additionally, we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestos containing materials. The estimated fair value of this obligation is $5 million at December 31, 2005, which is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position pursuant to FIN 47. Environmental We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We identified 370 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 43 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 23 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site. When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Environmental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $45 million, $46 million, and $26 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a liability of $213 million and $201 million, respectively, accrued for future environmental costs, of which $46 million and $50 million, respectively, were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Personal Injury The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third party actuaries to assist us with measuring the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. Annual expenses for personal injury related events were $247 million in 2005, $288 million in 2004, and $250 million in 2003. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had accrued liabilities of $619 million and $639 million for future personal injury costs, respectively, of which $274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation. 38 Table of Contents Our personal injury claims activity was as follows: Claims Activity 2005 2004 2003 Open claims, beginning balance 4,028 4,085 4,116 New claims 4,584 4,366 4,494 Settled or dismissed claims (4,415 ) (4,423 ) (4,525 ) Open claims, ending balance at December 31 4,197 4,028 4,085 Depreciation The railroad industry is capital intensive. Properties are carried at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group, based on the results of a depreciation study. We are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property to the STB for review and approval. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations. The cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five year period. An obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis. Capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets. Cash capital spending totaled $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2003, we implemented depreciation studies, approved by the STB, resulting in lower depreciation expense of $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets (effective January 1, 2003), partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets (effective July 1, 2003). For the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation expense was $1.2 billion. Various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property. Due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets, variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $40 million. If the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $43 million. Income Taxes As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For example, a 1% increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $240 million. When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based in part on managements judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events. Based on that analysis, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $5 million and $11 million against certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Insurance Subsidiaries We have two consolidated, wholly owned subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks, including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance. At December 31, 2005, current accounts receivable and current accrued casualty costs included $65 million for reinsurance receivables and reinsured liability, respectively, held by one of our insurance subsidiaries 39 Table of Contents related to losses sustained during the West Coast storm in January 2005. This amount may change in the future as facts and circumstances surrounding the claim and the reinsurance are finalized and settled. We collected a partial recovery of our claim from reinsurance of $25 million during the fourth quarter of 2005. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For other postretirement benefits, the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate. We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors: Discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans expected benefit payments. Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. Healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions. The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and OPEB expense for 2005 and the estimated impact on 2005 pension and OPEB expense relative to a change in those assumptions: Assumptions Pension OPEB Discount rate 6.00 % 6.00 % Expected return on plan assets 8.00 % N/A Healthcare cost trend rate: Current N/A 11.00 % Level in 2010 N/A 5.00 % Sensitivities Increase in Expense Millions of Dollars Pension OPEB 0.25% decrease in discount rate $ 5 $ 1 0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets $ 4 N/A 1% increase in healthcare cost trend rate N/A $ 13 CAUTIONARY INFORMATION Certain statements in this report, and statements in other material filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us), are, or will be, forward looking statements as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
