Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Operations 2001 Compared to 2000 The following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue, average daily package volume and average revenue per piece, both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms: Years Ended December 31, Change 2001 2000 $ % Revenue (in millions): U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 5,433 $ 5,664 $ (231 ) (4.1 )% Deferred 2,893 2,910 (17 ) (0.6 ) Ground 15,671 15,428 243 1.6 Total U.S. domestic package 23,997 24,002 (5 ) 0.0 International package: Domestic 907 904 3 0.3 Export 2,931 2,818 113 4.0 Cargo 407 356 51 14.3 Total International package 4,245 4,078 167 4.1 Non package: UPS Logistics Group 1,354 1,021 333 32.6 Forwarding and Brokerage Services 450 88 362 411.4 Other 600 582 18 3.1 Total Non package 2,404 1,691 713 42.2 Consolidated $ 30,646 $ 29,771 $ 875 2.9 % Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands): U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air 1,116 1,122 (6 ) (0.5 )% Deferred 917 914 3 0.3 Ground 10,317 10,434 (117 ) (1.1 ) Total U.S. domestic package 12,350 12,470 (120 ) (1.0 ) International package: Domestic 805 786 19 2.4 Export 408 368 40 10.9 Total International package 1,213 1,154 59 5.1 Consolidated 13,563 13,624 (61 ) (0.4 )% Average Revenue Per Piece: U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 19.32 $ 19.87 $ (0.55 ) (2.8 )% Deferred 12.52 12.53 (0.01 ) (0.1 ) Ground 6.03 5.82 0.21 3.6 Total U.S. domestic package 7.71 7.58 0.13 1.7 International package: Domestic 4.47 4.53 (0.06 ) (1.3 ) Export 28.51 30.15 (1.64 ) (5.4 ) Total International package 12.56 12.70 (0.14 ) (1.1 ) Consolidated $ 8.14 $ 8.01 $ 0.13 1.6 % 21 U.S. domestic package revenue was flat compared to 2000, primarily as a result of a 1.0% decrease in average daily package volume, offset by a 1.7% increase in average revenue per piece. The decrease in volume resulted from the declining U.S. economy during 2001. For the first quarter of 2001, average daily domestic volume was up 1.3%. However, average daily domestic volume was down 0.9% during the second quarter, down 3.4% during the third quarter, and down 0.8% during the fourth quarter. The third quarter decline was largely a result of the events of September 11th. Also affecting the period comparison were two extra operating days in 2000 compared to 2001. During the first quarter of 2001, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.05 over the commercial ground rate, and we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 3.7%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $25.00 to $27.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased by 2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. In addition, all package rates during 2001, up until December 10th, included a 1.25% fuel surcharge that was put in place August 7, 2000. Effective December 10, 2001, we implemented an index based surcharge which initially reduced the surcharge rate to 0.75% and which will reset on a monthly basis beginning in February 2002. The index based surcharge could range from 0.00% to 1.50% and is based on the National U.S. Average On Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Approximately $348 million in revenue was recorded in 2001 as a result of our fuel surcharge, an increase of $218 million over the prior year. The increase in international package revenue was due primarily to an increase in cargo revenue and a 10.9% volume growth for our export products, offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these products. The increase in cargo revenue resulted primarily from increased volume which was driven by the integration of Challenge Air. Our Europe region was a significant contributor to the export volume increase. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, average revenue per piece for international products increased 1.7%. Overall average daily package volume increased over 5% for international operations. The increase in non package revenue resulted primarily from the impact of acquisitions, particularly Fritz, which is included in our Forwarding and Brokerage Services component. Non package revenue also increased due to the continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. The Logistics Group revenue increase was primarily due to increases in our supply chain management and service parts logistics offerings. Other non package revenue also increased as a result of acquisitions (First International Bancorp and Mail Boxes Etc.), offset by a decrease in third party air operations revenue due to the discontinuation of our charter passenger services. Operating expenses increased by $1.425 billion, or 5.6%, with compensation and benefits up $851 million and other operating expenses up $574 million. The 5.1% increase in compensation and benefits included a $101 million reduction in pension benefits expense, as discussed in Note 5. Depreciation and amortization and other occupancy expenses (primarily rent and utilities) accounted for over one half of the 6.6% increase in other operating expenses. Much of the increase in operating expenses was related to expanding our capabilities and service offerings for our non package segment. Excluding the non package segment, operating expenses increased by 2.6% over 2000. Other operating expenses include a credit of $74 million for compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, as discussed in Note 18. Depreciation and amortization expense included $72 million of goodwill amortization, a $33 million increase from 2000. Our operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, declined from 15.2% for 2000 to 12.9% for 2001. This decline continued the trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2000 as the economy began to weaken. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was comparable to the operating margin for the year. 22 The following table shows the change in operating profit, both in dollars and in percentage terms: Years Ended December 31, Change Operating Segment 2001 2000 $ % (In millions) U.S. domestic package $ 3,620 $ 3,929 $ (309 ) (7.9 )% International package 125 277 (152 ) (54.9 ) Non package 217 306 (89 ) (29.1 ) Consolidated operating profit $ 3,962 $ 4,512 $ (550 ) (12.2 )% U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased by $309 million due primarily to the decline in volume discussed previously. This decrease was mitigated by the cost control initiatives implemented during the year. These initiatives focused on many of our semi variable costs and included curtailing non union hiring, eliminating new consulting projects, reevaluating all capital expenditures and information technology projects in process, plus a variety of other items. As discussed in Note 18, we recorded a credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which benefited this segment by $28 million. The decline in the operating profit of our international package operations resulted primarily from increased expenses, particularly those expenses associated with aircraft used in this segment (maintenance, rental and fuel) as we continued to add air lift capabilities to further expand our international presence. This segment was also impacted by the events of September 11th, and we recorded a $46 million credit to expense for this segment related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act as discussed in Note 18. We recorded $11 million of goodwill amortization in our international package segment in both 2001 and 2000. The decrease in non package operating profit is partially due to the $49 million gain we recognized from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary in the first quarter of 2000. The remaining decrease is due to start up, integration and operating costs for several subsidiaries that we are developing or have acquired, along with goodwill amortization expense associated with recent acquisitions. During 2001, we recorded $61 million of goodwill amortization in our non package segment, which is an increase of $33 million over 2000. Non package operating profit includes $113 million (compared to $101 million in 2000) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. The decrease in investment income of $368 million for 2001 is due to two factors relating to 2000. First, in the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a $241 million gain on investments held by our Strategic Enterprise Fund in two companies that were acquired by other companies. In addition, we earned income on the $5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that occurred in early March 2000, and the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer. Net income for 2001 amounted to $2.399 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to $2.934 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, for 2000. Our 2000 results reflect certain non recurring items, which include the gains on our Strategic Enterprise Fund investments and the sale of our Truck Leasing subsidiary (discussed above), offset partially by a charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new full time jobs from existing part time Teamster jobs. Our 2001 results reflect a FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment, net of tax, of $26 million. Excluding these non recurring transactions for each of these periods, adjusted net income for 2001 would have been $2.425 billion, a decrease of $370 million from adjusted net income of $2.795 billion for 2000. Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased from $2.38 in 2000 to $2.12 in 2001. 23 2000 Compared to 1999 The following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue, average daily package volume and average revenue per piece, both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms: Years Ended December 31, Change 2000 1999 $ % Revenue (in millions): U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 5,664 $ 5,240 $ 424 8.1 % Deferred 2,910 2,694 216 8.0 Ground 15,428 14,379 1,049 7.3 Total U.S. domestic package 24,002 22,313 1,689 7.6 International package: Domestic 904 924 (20 ) (2.2 ) Export 2,818 2,479 339 13.7 Cargo 356 315 41 13.0 Total international package 4,078 3,718 360 9.7 Non package UPS Logistics Group 1,021 771 250 32.4 Forwarding and Brokerage Services 88 12 76 633.3 Other 582 238 344 144.5 Total non package 1,691 1,021 670 65.6 Consolidated $ 29,771 $ 27,052 $ 2,719 10.1 % Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands): U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 1,122 $ 1,039 $ 83 8.0 % Deferred 914 852 62 7.3 Ground 10,434 10,016 418 4.2 Total U.S. domestic package 12,470 11,907 563 4.7 International package: Domestic 786 711 75 10.5 Export 368 303 65 21.5 Total international package 1,154 1,014 140 13.8 Consolidated $ 13,624 $ 12,921 $ 703 5.4 % Average Revenue Per Piece: U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 19.87 $ 19.86 $ 0.01 0.1 % Deferred 12.53 12.45 0.08 0.6 Ground 5.82 5.65 0.17 3.0 Total U.S. domestic package 7.58 7.38 0.20 2.7 International package: Domestic 4.53 5.12 (0.59 ) (11.5 ) Export 30.15 32.21 (2.06 ) (6.4 ) Total international package 12.70 13.21 (0.51 ) (3.9 ) Consolidated $ 8.01 $ 7.84 $ 0.17 2.2 % 24 U.S. domestic package revenue increased almost $1.7 billion, or 7.6%, primarily due to volume gains across all product lines, combined with a 2.7% increase in average domestic revenue per piece, which was primarily driven by our Ground products. All products contributed to the revenue increase, with our higher revenue per piece express (Next Day Air and Deferred) products increasing at approximately the same rate (8.1% and 8.0% respectively). Our average daily Ground volume grew at a 4.2% rate for the period, helping to bring our total U.S. average daily package volume to almost 12.5 million pieces. During the first quarter of 2000, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge continued to be $1.00 over the commercial ground rate, with an additional delivery area surcharge of $1.50 added to certain less accessible areas. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver and UPS 2nd Day Air an average of 3.5%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. did not change. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased by 2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. The increase in international package revenue was due to double digit volume growth for both our domestic and export products, offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these products. This decline was primarily due to a decline in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar that occurred during 2000. The value of the Euro averaged $0.92 in 2000 compared to $1.07 in 1999. Overall average daily package volume increased 13.8% for international operations, with our export products, which had an average revenue per piece in excess of $30, increasing at 21.5%. The increase in non package revenue resulted primarily from the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers as well as continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. Revenue for the UPS Logistics Group increased by $250 million, or 32.4%, to over $1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance began in the fourth quarter of 1999. Consequently, this item will have a reduced impact on the comparability of the revenue for our non package segment in future periods. Operating expenses increased by $2.112 billion, or 9.1%, which was less than our revenue increase of 10.1%. Compensation and benefits expenses, the largest component of this increase, accounted for $1.261 billion of the increase and included a $59 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2000 relating to the creation of 4,000 new full time hourly jobs resulting from the 1997 Teamsters contract. Other operating expenses increased $851 million primarily due to higher purchased transportation costs, higher fuel costs and claims expense associated with the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers. The increase in purchased transportation costs was primarily due to increased business for our international and logistics operations. The 40.1% increase in fuel costs from $681 million to $954 million was due to the increase in fuel prices during 2000 and the additional fuel usage due to the growth in our average daily package volume, partially offset by cost reductions generated by our fuel hedging program. The increase in other operating expenses of $219 million was slightly offset by the $49 million gain we recognized in the first quarter of 2000 from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary. International operating expenses were favorably impacted by the decline in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar as discussed above. To offset the increasing fuel costs, we implemented a temporary 1.25% fuel surcharge effective August 7, 2000. Approximately $130 million in revenue was recorded in 2000 as a result of the surcharge. Our operating margin improved from 14.4% during 1999 to 15.2% during 2000. This improvement was favorably impacted by continued product mix improvements and our continued successful efforts in obtaining profitable volume growth. 25 The following table shows the change in operating profit, both in dollars and in percentage terms: Years Ended December 31, Change Operating Segment 2000 1999 $ % (In millions) U.S. domestic package $ 3,929 $ 3,506 $ 423 12.1 % International package 277 230 47 20.4 Non package 306 169 137 81.1 Consolidated operating profit $ 4,512 $ 3,905 $ 607 15.5 % U.S. domestic package operating profit increased by $423 million, or 12.1%, due to the volume and revenue improvements discussed previously. The improvement in the operating profit of our international package segment of 20.4%, or $47 million, resulted primarily from increased volume and revenue, and was realized despite significantly higher fuel costs. This improvement occurred throughout our international regions. The improvement in operating profit for this segment would have been $36 million greater, if the impact of currency fluctuations was excluded. The increase in non package operating profit is largely due to the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers, which contributed $183 million of additional operating profit for the year. Also contributing to the operating profit improvement was the $49 million gain we recognized during the first quarter of 2000 from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary. These improvements were offset somewhat by start up costs associated with UPS Logistics Groups service parts logistics offering, UPS e Ventures, UPS Capital Corporation and other initiatives. Non package operating profit includes $101 million (compared to $108 million in 1999) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. The increase in investment income of $330 million for the period is primarily due to two factors. First, in the first quarter of 2000, two companies in which our Strategic Enterprise Fund held investments were acquired by other companies, which caused us to recognize a gain of $241 million. Second, we earned income on the $5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that was completed in early March 2000 and the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer. In 1999, we had the net IPO proceeds available for investment from mid November through the end of the year. We announced a share repurchase program on April 20, 2000 under which we would utilize up to the remaining $1.2 billion not used in the tender offer. As of December 31, 2000, approximately $105 million remained available for share repurchases. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $2.934 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, compared to net income of $883 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the prior year. Our 2000 results reflect the non recurring items discussed above, which include the gains on our Strategic Enterprise Fund investments and the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary, offset partially by the charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new full time jobs from existing part time Teamster jobs. Our 1999 results reflect a tax assessment charge resulting from an unfavorable ruling of the U.S. Tax Court. Excluding these non recurring transactions for each of these years, adjusted net income for 2000 would have been $2.795 billion, an increase in excess of 20% over adjusted 1999 net income of $2.325 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share would have increased from $2.04 in 1999 to $2.38 in 2000. Our fourth quarter 2000 results reflected a decline in our previously reported growth rates for both revenue and average daily volume. These declines were caused by an overall weakening of the economy. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short term investments, amounting to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2001. 26 As part of our continuing share repurchase program, $1.3 billion was authorized for share repurchases in May 2001, and an additional $1.0 billion was authorized for share repurchases in February 2002. We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $1.694 billion was outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2001, of which $1.25 billion has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The average interest rate on the amount outstanding at December 31, 2001 was 1.85%. In addition, we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2001. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of $1.25 billion each, with one expiring on April 25, 2002 and the other expiring on April 27, 2005. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2001. We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At December 31, 2001, $1.0 billion was available under this program. The 500 million Pound Sterling denominated bonds which are outstanding (recorded at $725 million at December 31, 2001) were issued in February 2001 and bear interest at a stated rate of 5.50%. We have a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the U.S. There was approximately $1.132 billion issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2001, including $491 million in notes issued under the UPS Notes program. These notes have various terms and maturities, all with fixed interest rates. Also during 2001, we issued $89 million in floating rate senior notes due December 2050, $52 million in floating rate senior notes due June 2051, and $95 million in floating rate senior notes due December 2051, all of which bear interest at one month LIBOR less 45 basis points. On August 9, 1999, the United States Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd. (OPL), a Bermuda company that had reinsured excess value (EV) package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The Court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes of $31 million on income reported by OPL, penalties and penalty interest of $93 million, and interest for a total after tax exposure estimated at approximately $246 million. On June 20, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Tax Courts decision. On September 13, 2001, the Eleventh Circuit denied the IRSs petition to have the appeal reheard en banc. The IRS did not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court and, consequently, the case has been remanded to the Tax Court to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of the remanded proceedings in the Tax Court will be. The IRS has taken similar positions to those advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984. Tax years 1985 through 1990 currently are docketed in the Tax Court, although no trial date has been set pending resolution of the case that covers the 1984 year. Further, the IRS has issued a report asserting similar positions for the 1991 through 1994 tax years, and we expect the IRS to take similar positions for tax years 1995 through 1999. We are named as a defendant in twenty five pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for EV package insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on a variety of state and federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive. 27 These actions were filed after the August 9, 1999 Tax Court decision. As discussed above, on June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. Twenty four of these twenty five cases have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation proceeding (MDL Proceeding) in federal court in New York. Motions to dismiss these cases are pending, as are motions to remand several of these cases to state court. The other pending case was filed on January 28, 2002 in state court in Georgia. We have removed it to federal court and are seeking to have it consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. We believe that the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. The ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be determined. There was an additional EV case that was pending in state court in Madison County, Illinois (Triad Industries, Inc. v. UPS). Shortly before the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Tax Court decision, we entered into a settlement of this case only with respect to Illinois EV shippers based in part on our desire to vigorously defend these actions in the single MDL Proceeding. While expressly denying any and all liability, the settlement resolved the Illinois case. This settlement has no impact on the claims pending in the MDL Proceeding regarding EV purchases relating to shipments from states other than Illinois. The Illinois court held a fairness hearing on November 15, 2001, and approved the settlement. No appeals were filed to challenge the settlement, and the deadline to do so has passed. Under the settlement, we will provide qualifying settlement class members with coupons toward the purchase of specified UPS services, subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement, and have paid the agreed upon plaintiffs attorneys fees. The settlements ultimate cost to us will depend upon a number of factors. This settlement did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Reference is made to Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on the preceding matters. Due to the events of September 11, 2001 (as described in Note 18), increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions, including self insuring certain risks, to mitigate the expense increase. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately 232,500 employees (64% of total employees) employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. These agreements run through July 31, 2002. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable January 1, 2004. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on July 31, 2001. Members of Teamsters 2727 recently voted down a proposed new contract, and negotiations are scheduled to resume in April 2002. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements have various expiration dates between July 31, 2002 and May 31, 2003. We entered into negotiations with the Teamsters in January 2002 for a new national master agreement. It is our desire through these discussions to reach an agreement on a new contract prior to the end of our current five year agreement on July 31, 2002. Any strike, work stoppage or slowdown that results from our failure to reach a timely agreement with the Teamsters, and any change in shipping behavior by our customers or potential customers due to perceptions that we will not reach a timely agreement with the Teamsters, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We do not, however, anticipate that this will occur. 28 In November 2001, we announced rate increases, that took effect on January 7, 2002, and are in line with previous rate increases. We increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.5% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.10 over the commercial ground rate, and this charge will also be applied to express deliveries in 2002. The additional delivery area surcharge added to ground deliveries in certain less accessible areas remained at $1.50, however in 2002 this charge will also be applied to express deliveries to these addresses. Rates for UPS Hundredweight will increase 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 4.0%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $27.50 to $28.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. An index based surcharge, which initially was effective December 10, 2001, will continue and will reset on a monthly basis beginning in February 2002. The index based surcharge could range from 0.00% to 1.50% and is based on the National U.S. Average On Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases, through 2009. Following is a summary of capital expenditures: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Buildings and facilities $ 763 $ 947 $ 579 Aircraft and parts 932 645 433 Vehicles 303 156 139 Information technology 374 399 325 $ 2,372 $ 2,147 $ 1,476 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 billion in 2002. These expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software. A discussion of our anticipated future payments under operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, and purchase commitments is provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. A discussion of our unfunded lending commitments is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and certain commodity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as UPS does not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. 29 A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was a liability of approximately $(27) and $(5) million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $27 and $9 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating costs, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of approximately $4 and $(9) million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $4 and $37 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have various debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that are issued at fixed rates of interest. Such financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. The fair value of our total long term debt, including current maturities, at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $5.3 and $3.7 billion, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% shift in interest rates would be approximately $196 and $127 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was an asset (liability) of approximately $(74) and $3 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% shift in interest rates would be approximately $67 and $30 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates. 30 Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various available for sale equity securities which are subject to price risk. The fair value of such investments, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, was an asset of approximately $341 and $382 million, respectively. In addition, we utilize options to hedge the price risk for certain of these equity securities. The potential change in the fair value of these investments, assuming a 10% change in prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $12 and $31 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. Future Accounting Changes In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 Business Combinations (FAS 141) and Statement No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142). FAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. FAS 141 also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. FAS 142 eliminates the current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization of intangible assets with a defined life, and addresses the impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill amortization, which was $72 million for 2001, ceased when we implemented FAS 142 on January 1, 2002. To comply with the transition provisions of FAS 142, we have determined our reporting units and assigned goodwill and other net assets to those reporting units. Goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units is being tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is primarily being determined through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. We have not completed our impairment testing required by the transition provisions of FAS 142, and therefore it is not practical, at this time, to estimate the impact of adoption of this statement. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144) which superceded Statement No. 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of (FAS 121). FAS 144 establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, and resolves several implementation issues arising from FAS 121. FAS 144 became effective for us on January 1, 2002, and the effects of adoption were not material to our results of operations or financial condition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, such as pension and postretirement medical benefits and provisions for self insured risks, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies As discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with 31 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. Goodwill impairment The FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (FAS 142) in June 2001. As a result of the issuance of this new standard, goodwill will no longer be amortized, but will be subjected to annual impairment testing starting in 2002. Goodwill impairment testing will require that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. The estimation of fair value will require that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on the a variety of factors, including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units. We have not completed our transitional impairment testing required by FAS 142, so we are unable to estimate the impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements. At December 31, 2001, our recorded goodwill (net of accumulated amortization) was $1.112 billion. Derivative instruments As discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the Market Risk section of this report, we hedge certain risks that are incurred in the normal operation of our business. In connection with these activities, we have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which requires that all financial derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, price quotations for similar instruments traded in different markets, and pricing models that consider current market conditions and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that are inherently difficult to predict. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements: The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets also are affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with our competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result 32 from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. The impact of competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates. An increase in the prices of gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles. We require significant quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. Item 7A.
