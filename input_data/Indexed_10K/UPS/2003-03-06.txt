Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to provide our investors with an understanding of our results of operations for the most recent years and our current financial condition. This discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report. Operations The following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue, average daily package volume and average revenue per piece, both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms: Year Ended December 31, Change 2002 2001 $ % Revenue (in millions): U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 5,349 $ 5,433 $ (84 ) (1.5 )% Deferred 2,868 2,893 (25 ) (0.9 ) Ground 15,707 15,671 36 0.2 Total U.S. domestic package 23,924 23,997 (73 ) (0.3 ) International package: Domestic 943 907 36 4.0 Export 3,276 2,931 345 11.8 Cargo 461 407 54 13.3 Total International package 4,680 4,245 435 10.2 Non package: UPS Logistics Group 1,024 738 286 38.8 UPS Freight Services 945 741 204 27.5 Other 699 600 99 16.5 Total Non package 2,668 2,079 589 28.3 Consolidated $ 31,272 $ 30,321 $ 951 3.1 % Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands): # U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air 1,111 1,116 (5 ) (0.4 )% Deferred 895 917 (22 ) (2.4 ) Ground 10,112 10,317 (205 ) (2.0 ) Total U.S. domestic package 12,118 12,350 (232 ) (1.9 ) International package: Domestic 779 805 (26 ) (3.2 ) Export 443 408 35 8.6 Total International package 1,222 1,213 9 0.7 Consolidated 13,340 13,563 (223 ) (1.6 )% Operating days in period 252 252 Average Revenue Per Piece: U.S. domestic package: $ Next Day Air $ 19.11 $ 19.32 $ (0.21 ) (1.1 )% Deferred 12.72 12.52 0.20 1.6 Ground 6.16 6.03 0.13 2.2 Total U.S. domestic package 7.83 7.71 0.12 1.6 International package: Domestic 4.80 4.47 0.33 7.4 Export 29.35 28.51 0.84 2.9 Total International package 13.70 12.56 1.14 9.1 Consolidated $ 8.37 $ 8.14 $ 0.23 2.8 % 17 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Change 2001 2000 $ % Revenue (in millions): U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 5,433 $ 5,664 $ (231 ) (4.1 )% Deferred 2,893 2,910 (17 ) (0.6 ) Ground 15,671 15,428 243 1.6 Total U.S. domestic package 23,997 24,002 (5 ) (0.0 ) International package: Domestic 907 904 3 0.3 Export 2,931 2,818 113 4.0 Cargo 407 356 51 14.3 Total International package 4,245 4,078 167 4.1 Non package: UPS Logistics Group 738 451 287 63.6 UPS Freight Services 741 385 356 92.5 Other 600 582 18 3.1 Total Non package 2,079 1,418 661 46.6 Consolidated $ 30,321 $ 29,498 $ 823 2.8 % Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands): # U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air 1,116 1,122 (6 ) (0.5 )% Deferred 917 914 3 0.3 Ground 10,317 10,434 (117 ) (1.1 ) Total U.S. domestic package 12,350 12,470 (120 ) (1.0 ) International package: Domestic 805 786 19 2.4 Export 408 368 40 10.9 Total International package 1,213 1,154 59 5.1 Consolidated 13,563 13,624 (61 ) (0.4 )% Operating days in period 252 254 Average Revenue Per Piece: U.S. domestic package: $ Next Day Air $ 19.32 $ 19.87 $ (0.55 ) (2.8 )% Deferred 12.52 12.53 (0.01 ) (0.1 ) Ground 6.03 5.82 0.21 3.6 Total U.S. domestic package 7.71 7.58 0.13 1.7 International package: Domestic 4.47 4.53 (0.06 ) (1.3 ) Export 28.51 30.15 (1.64 ) (5.4 ) Total International package 12.56 12.70 (0.14 ) (1.1 ) Consolidated $ 8.14 $ 8.01 $ 0.13 1.6 % 18 Table of Contents Operating Profit The following tables set forth information showing the change in operating profit, both in dollars (in millions) and in percentage terms: Year Ended December 31, Change Operating Segment 2002 2001 $ % U.S. domestic package $ 3,576 $ 3,620 $ (44 ) (1.2 )% International package 322 125 197 157.6 Non package 198 217 (19 ) (8.8 ) Consolidated Operating Profit $ 4,096 $ 3,962 $ 134 3.4 % ?Year Ended ?December 31, Change Operating Segment 2001 2000 $ % U.S. domestic package $ 3,620 $ 3,929 $ (309 ) (7.9 )% International package 125 277 (152 ) (54.9 ) Non package 217 306 (89 ) (29.1 ) Consolidated Operating Profit $ 3,962 $ 4,512 $ (550 ) (12.2 )% U. S. Domestic Package Operations 2002 compared to 2001 U.S. domestic package revenue decreased $73 million, or 0.3%, for the year. This decrease was driven by a 1.9% decrease in average daily package volume, and partially offset by a 1.6% increase in revenue per piece. The decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors in connection with the agreement reached on a new six year contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, combined with the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the July 31, 2002 expiration date of the existing contract. On January 7, 2002, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.5% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.10 over the commercial ground rate, and this charge also was applied to express deliveries. The additional delivery area surcharge, which is added to ground deliveries in certain less accessible areas, remained at $1.50, and also was applied to express deliveries. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. We also increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 4.0%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $27.50 to $28.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the U.S. (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market. An index based fuel surcharge continued during 2002. The index based surcharge, which resets on a monthly basis, replaced a fixed fuel surcharge of 1.25%, which was originally implemented prior to 2001. The current surcharge is based on the National U.S. Average On Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 0.78%. Approximately $251 million in revenue was recorded in 2002 as a result of our fuel surcharge, a decrease of $97 million from the prior year. U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased $44 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2002. Operating profit was affected by a non recurring benefit to operating expense of $175 million that occurred in 2002 related to a change in our vacation policy for non union employees. Excluding this item, U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased $219 million, or 6.0% for the year, due to the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an increase in operating expenses (discussed further below). In 2001, 19 Table of Contents we recorded a credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which benefited the U.S. domestic package segment by $28 million. 2001 compared to 2000 U.S. domestic package revenue was flat in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily as a result of a 1.0% decrease in average daily package volume, offset by a 1.7% increase in average revenue per piece. The decrease in volume resulted from the declining U.S. economy during 2001. For the first quarter of 2001, average daily domestic volume was up 1.3%. However, average daily domestic volume was down 0.9% during the second quarter, down 3.4% during the third quarter, and down 0.8% during the fourth quarter. The third quarter decline was largely a result of the events of September 11. Also affecting the comparison were two extra operating days in 2000 compared to 2001. During the first quarter of 2001, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.05 over the commercial ground rate, and we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 3.7%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $25.00 to $27.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the U.S. (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service) increased by 2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout 2001 and varied by geographic market. In addition, all package rates during 2001, until December 10th, included a 1.25% fuel surcharge. Effective December 10, 2001, we implemented an index based surcharge, which initially reduced the surcharge rate to 0.75% and resets on a monthly basis. Approximately $348 million in revenue was recorded in 2001 as a result of our fuel surcharge, an increase of $218 million over the prior year. U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased by $309 million due primarily to the decline in volume discussed previously. This decrease was mitigated by cost control initiatives implemented during the year. These initiatives focused on many of our semi variable costs and included curtailing non union hiring, eliminating new consulting projects, reevaluating all capital expenditures and information technology projects in process, plus a variety of other items. International Package Operations 2002 compared to 2001 For the year ended December 31, 2002, international package revenue improved $435 million, or 10.2% (8.1% currency adjusted), due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements. This volume growth was driven primarily by the Europe region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 13.6%, and the Asia Pacific region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 17.1%. In total, international package average daily volume increased 0.7% and average revenue per piece increased 9.1% (6.8% currency adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $197 million for the year. In 2002, operating profit benefited from an $11 million reduction to expense related to the change in vacation policy. Excluding the effect of this item, operating profit increased by $186 million, or 148.8% for the year, $22 million of which was due to currency fluctuations. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to export volume growth of 8.6% and a strong increase in revenue per piece. In addition, the shutdown of the U.S. West Coast ports during the latter part of 2002 had a beneficial impact on our international package results. In 2002, this segment benefited by $11 million from the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, operating profit benefited from a $46 million credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. 2001 compared to 2000 The increase in international package revenue in 2001 was due primarily to an increase in cargo revenue and a 10.9% volume growth for our export products, offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these 20 Table of Contents products. The increase in cargo revenue resulted primarily from increased volume, which was driven by the integration of our Challenge Air operations in Latin America. Our Europe region was a significant contributor to the export volume increase. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, average revenue per piece increased 1.7%. Overall average daily package volume increased over 5% for international operations. The decline in the operating profit of our international package operations during 2001 resulted primarily from increased expenses, particularly those expenses associated with aircraft used in this segment (maintenance, rental and fuel) as we continued to add airlift capabilities to further expand our international presence. We recorded $11 million of goodwill amortization in our international package segment in both 2001 and 2000. Non Package Operations 2002 compared to 2001 Non package revenue increased $589 million, or 28.3%, during 2002. 20.4% of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was organic. UPS Logistics Group revenue was up $286 million or 38.8% for the year, of which approximately half was due to acquisitions. UPS Freight Services revenue grew $204 million, or 27.5%, primarily due to having a full year of revenue from Fritz Companies Inc., which we acquired in May 2001. Revenue growth at UPS Freight Services was hindered by the sale of the FedEx brokerage business in March 2002. Adjusting for the effect of this sale, Freight Services would have reported organic revenue growth of approximately 4% during 2002. Non package operating profit decreased by $19 million, or 8.8%, for the year. Operating profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related expenses of $106 million primarily related to the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations, and an $11 million reduction to expense related to a change in our vacation policy. Excluding the impact of these items, non package operating profit increased by $76 million, or 35.0%. In 2002, this segment benefited from a $61 million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization. Non package operating profit includes $112 million (compared to $113 million in 2001) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. 2001 compared to 2000 The increase in non package revenue in 2001 resulted primarily from the impact of acquisitions, particularly Fritz, which was included in our Freight Services unit. Non package revenue also increased due to the continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. The Logistics Group revenue increase was primarily due to increases in our supply chain management and service parts logistics offerings. Other non package revenue also increased as a result of acquisitions (First International Bancorp and Mail Boxes Etc.), offset by a decrease in third party air operations revenue due to the discontinuation of our charter passenger services. The decrease in non package operating profit was partially due to the $49 million gain we recognized from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary in the first quarter of 2000. The remaining decrease was due to start up, integration and operating costs for several subsidiaries that we were developing or acquired, along with goodwill amortization expense associated with acquisitions. During 2001, we recorded $61 million of goodwill amortization in our non package segment, which was an increase of $33 million over 2000. Non package operating profit included $113 million (compared to $101 million in 2000) of intersegment profit. Operating Expenses and Operating Margin 2002 compared to 2001 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $817 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, operating expenses were affected by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses in our non package segment, and the $197 million credit to expense related to the change in our vacation policy. Excluding the effect of these items, operating expenses increased by $908 million, or 3.4%, for the year. 21 Table of Contents Excluding the $197 million credit to expense related to the change in vacation policy, compensation and benefits increased by $744 million, or 4.3%, for the year, primarily due to increased costs associated with health and retirement benefits. Other operating expenses increased by $164 million, or 1.8%, excluding the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses. The non package segment accounted for $513 million of the $908 million total increase in operating expenses. This was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of 2001. In 2002, operating expenses benefited from the absence of $72 million of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, other operating expenses were reduced by $74 million for compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. Adjusting for the effects of the restructuring charge and related expenses and vacation policy change, our operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 13.1% during 2001 to 12.8% during 2002. This decline is primarily due to a 90 basis point decline in the operating margin for our U.S. domestic package segment, which experienced a volume driven decline in profit. 2001 compared to 2000 In 2001, operating expenses increased by $1.373 billion, or 5.5%, with compensation and benefits up $851 million and other operating expenses up $522 million. The 5.1% increase in compensation and benefits included a $101 million reduction in pension benefits expense. Depreciation and amortization and other occupancy expenses (primarily rent and utilities) accounted for over one half of the 6.2% increase in other operating expenses. Much of the increase in operating expenses was related to expanding our capabilities and service offerings for our non package segment. Excluding the non package segment, operating expenses increased by 2.5% over 2000. Depreciation and amortization expense included $72 million of goodwill amortization, a $33 million increase from 2000. Our adjusted operating margin declined from 15.3% for 2000 to 13.1% for 2001. This decline continued the trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2000 as the economy began to weaken. Investment Income/Interest Expense 2002 compared to 2001 The decrease in investment income of $96 million for 2002 is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment. 2001 compared to 2000 The decrease in investment income of $368 million for 2001 is due to two factors relating to 2000. First, in the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a $241 million gain on investments held by our Strategic Enterprise Fund in two companies that were acquired by other companies. In addition, we earned income on the $5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that occurred in early March 2000, and the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer. 22 Table of Contents Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2002 compared to 2001 Net income for 2002 was $3.182 billion, an increase of $783 million from $2.399 billion in 2001, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.81 in 2002 from $2.10 in 2001. Adjusting for the non recurring FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment, net of tax, of $26 million, our net income in 2001 would have been $2.425 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share. In 2002, our results were affected by the fourth quarter restructuring charge and related expenses of $106 million, the non recurring FAS 142 cumulative expense adjustment of $72 million, the credit to compensation and benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for non union employees of $197 million, and the credit related to the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability of $1.023 billion. Excluding the impact of these non recurring items, our 2002 net income would have been $2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share (compared to $2.12 in 2001). 2001 compared to 2000 Net income for 2001 amounted to $2.399 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to $2.934 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, for 2000. Our 2000 results reflected certain non recurring items, which include the gains on our Strategic Enterprise Fund investments and the sale of our Truck Leasing subsidiary, offset partially by a charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new full time jobs from existing part time Teamster jobs. Our 2001 results reflect a FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment, net of tax, of $26 million. Excluding these non recurring transactions for each of these periods, adjusted net income for 2001 would have been $2.425 billion, a decrease of $370 million from adjusted net income of $2.795 billion for 2000. Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased from $2.38 in 2000 to $2.12 in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short term investments, amounting to $3.014 billion at December 31, 2002. As part of our continuing share repurchase program, $1.0 billion was authorized for share repurchases in February 2002, of which $705 million was still available as of December 31, 2002. We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $1.036 billion was outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2002, all of which was classified as a current liability. The average interest rate on the amount outstanding at December 31, 2002 was 1.3%. In addition, we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2002. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of $1.25 billion each, with one expiring on April 24, 2003 and the other expiring on April 27, 2005. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2002. We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At December 31, 2002, $1.0 billion was available under this program. We have a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the U.S. There was approximately $1.552 billion issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, $910 million in notes have been issued under the UPS Notes program. These notes have various terms and maturities, all with fixed interest rates. The notes are callable at various stated times after issuance, and $345 million of the notes have been called since the inception of the program. As of December 31, 2002, $565 million in UPS Notes were outstanding. 23 Table of Contents On August 9, 1999, the United States Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd. (OPL), a Bermuda company that had reinsured excess value (EV) package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The Court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes of $31 million on income reported by OPL, penalties and penalty interest of $93 million, and interest for a total after tax exposure estimated at approximately $246 million. The IRS took similar positions to those advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984. Based on the Tax Court decision, we estimated that our total after tax exposure for tax years 1984 through 1999 could have been as high as $2.353 billion. In our second quarter 1999 financial statements, we recorded a tax assessment charge of $1.786 billion, which included an amount for related state tax liabilities. The charge included taxes of $915 million and interest of $871 million. This assessment resulted in a tax benefit of $344 million related to the interest component of the assessment. As a result, our net charge to net income for the tax assessment was $1.442 billion, increasing our total after tax reserve at that time with respect to these matters to $1.672 billion. The tax benefit of deductible interest was included in income taxes in 1999; however, since none of the income on which this tax assessment was based was our income, we did not classify the tax charge as income taxes. We determined the size of our reserve with respect to these matters in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In 1999, we estimated our most likely liability based on the initial Tax Court decision. In making this determination, we concluded that, based on the Tax Court decision, it was more likely that we would be required to pay taxes on income reported by OPL and interest, but that it was not probable that we would be required to pay any penalties and penalty interest. In our prior estimation, if penalties and penalty interest ultimately were determined to be payable, we would have had to record an additional charge of up to $681 million. Further, as a result of the unfavorable Tax Court decision, and in order to stop the potential accrual of additional interest that might ultimately have been determined to be due to the IRS, on August 31, 1999 we paid $1.349 billion, and on August 8, 2000 paid an additional $91 million, to the IRS related to these matters for the 1984 through 1994 tax years. We included the profit of the EV insurance program, using the IRSs methodology for calculating these amounts, for both 1998 and 1999 in filings we made with the IRS in 1999. In February 2000, we paid $339 million to the IRS related to these matters for the 1995 through 1997 tax years. On June 20, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Tax Courts decision. On September 13, 2001, the Eleventh Circuit denied the IRSs petition to have the appeal reheard en banc. The IRS did not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court and, consequently, the case was remanded to the Tax Court to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to EV package insurance. Under the settlement of these issues, we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately $562 million, additions to tax of $60 million and related interest. The amount due to the IRS as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued (as described above). As a result of the settlement, we recorded income, before taxes, of $1.023 billion ($776 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2002. The refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years. The EV program that was the subject of the Tax Court decision has been changed since September 1999. The revised arrangement should eliminate the issues considered by the Tax Court and the Eleventh Circuit related to OPL. The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to the EV package insurance matters discussed above, regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses, the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. The proposed adjustments would result in $10 million of additional income tax expense. The IRS has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to 24 Table of Contents some of these issues for each of the years from 1991 through 1994. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $50 million in additional income tax expense. In November 2002, the IRS issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from 1995 through 1998. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $13 million in additional income tax expense. For the 1985 through 1998 tax years, unpaid interest on these adjustments through December 31, 2002 could aggregate up to approximately $381 million, after the benefit of related tax deductions. We expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2002. The IRSs proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest. We believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote. We believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are named as a defendant in 23 pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for EV insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive. These actions were filed after the August 9, 1999 Tax Court decision. As discussed above, on June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. These 23 cases have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation proceeding (MDL Proceeding) in federal court in New York. The Court has ruled on the motions to dismiss, granting our motions with respect to all of the plaintiffs tort claims and all of their breach of contract claims prior to August 26, 1994. Claims asserted under specific federal statutes, and breach of contract claims commencing on August 26, 1994, may proceed at this time. We intend to continue to seek dismissal of these remaining claims. The defendants in the MDL Proceeding, including UPS, have stipulated to conditional certification of a plaintiff class in most of the lawsuits challenging the EV insurance program for our shippers. Class certification is a procedural step that allows claims to be resolved at one time as to all potential claimants; it does not depend on or reflect the merits of the underlying claims. Defendants may move later to set aside or modify the class certification. The cases subject to the class certification stipulation will proceed to a single trial before the federal court presiding over the MDL Proceeding, instead of being returned for trial to the numerous federal courts around the country from which they were transferred. In addition, plaintiffs in the five cases with pending motions to remand to state court have withdrawn these motions. In addition to the cases in which UPS is named as a defendant, there also is an action, Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc., against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV insurance purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers. This case also has been consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. The plaintiff has moved to have the case remanded back to state court. We believe that the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. The ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be determined. In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the events of September 11, 2001, increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions, including self insuring certain risks, to mitigate the expense increase. 25 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 230,000 employees (64% of our total employees) employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. On October 7, 2002, the Teamsters ratified a new master agreement with UPS that runs through July 31, 2008. The new agreement is retroactive to August 1, 2002. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable January 1, 2004. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. In November 2002, we announced rate increases, which took effect on January 6, 2003, that are in line with previous rate increases. We increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.05 to $1.15 over the commercial ground rate. The additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain less accessible areas increased $0.25 to $1.75. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 3.4% and increased rates for deferred services by 4.5%. Rates for international shipments originating in the U.S. (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. The index based fuel surcharge remains in effect, and currently is 1.50%. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases, through 2009. Following is a summary of capital expenditures (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Buildings and facilities $ 528 $ 763 $ 947 Aircraft and parts 638 932 645 Vehicles 41 303 156 Information technology 451 374 399 $ 1,658 $ 2,372 $ 2,147 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 billion in 2003. These expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software. A discussion of our anticipated future payments under operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, and purchase commitments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. A discussion of our unfunded lending commitments is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to 26 Table of Contents determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was an asset (liability) of $34 and $(27) million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $38 million at December 31, 2002. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of approximately $(3) and $4 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $42 million at December 31, 2002. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have various debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that are issued at fixed rates of interest. Such financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. The fair value of our total long term debt, including current maturities, at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $4.926 and $5.338 billion, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $264 million at December 31, 2002. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was an asset (liability) of $(62) and $(74) million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $37 million at December 31, 2002. 27 Table of Contents As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have certain investments in securities that are purchased at fixed rates of interest. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of our investments in debt securities was $481 and $691 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $7 million at December 31, 2002. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold certain finance receivables, primarily commercial loans and finance leases, at fixed rates of interest. These assets are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of our investments in finance receivables was $1.492 billion and $982 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $5 million at December 31, 2002. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of such investments was $322 and $382 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% decline in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $10 million. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. Future Accounting Changes In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (FAS 146). FAS 146 provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after January 1, 2003. As discussed in Note 17, we implemented a restructuring program involving the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. As this restructuring program was initiated in 2002, we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in EITF 94 3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). Therefore, the adoption of FAS 146 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of $106 million, which is classified in other operating expenses. In 2003, we plan to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123), which is considered the preferable accounting method for stock based employee compensation. Under FAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, we have elected to adopt the measurement provisions of FAS 123 using the prospective method. Under this approach, all future employee stock option grants and other stock based compensation will be expensed to compensation and benefits over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date the stock based compensation is granted. We will continue to provide pro forma income and earnings per share information related to prior awards. The expensing of stock based compensation is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 in 2003. By 2006, we expect to realize the full impact of adopting FAS 123, and estimate that diluted earnings per share will be reduced by approximately $0.08 in that year. 28 Table of Contents In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002, while the recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact of the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 on our financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 provides guidance on the identification of variable interest entities, and the assessment of a companys interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether consolidation is appropriate. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by the primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for existing variable interest entities. As we have no material exposures to special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements, we anticipate that the effects of adopting FIN 46 will not be material to our results of operations or financial condition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. Goodwill Impairment The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (FAS 142) in June 2001. As a result of the issuance of this new standard, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subjected to annual impairment testing. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. The estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors, including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $72 million ($0.06 per diluted share), as of January 1, 2002, related to our Mail Technologies business. The primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business. As of December 31, 2002, our recorded goodwill was $1.070 billion. 29 Table of Contents Self Insurance Accruals We self insure estimated costs associated with workers compensation claims, automotive liability, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The recorded levels of these reserves are determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, however actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits The Companys pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. The impact of decreasing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to 9.21% and the decrease in the discount rate to 6.75%, combined with other factors, will increase our pension plan expense by approximately $135 million in 2003. Financial Instruments As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the Market Risk section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over the counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements: The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets also are affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. 30 Table of Contents Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with our competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. The impact of competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates. Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. Item 7A.
