Certain of this information is considered non GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, we refer to operating profit, operating margin, net income and earnings per share on an as adjusted basis, excluding certain transactions that we believe are not indicative of future results. We have presented these measures since we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that particular factors will repeat. When these non GAAP financial measures have been used, we have provided reconciliations of these adjusted measures to the appropriate GAAP measure for comparability purposes. U.S. Domestic Package Operations 2003 compared to 2002 U.S. domestic package revenue increased $1.098 billion, or 4.6%, for the year, which was driven by a 2.1% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.6% increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume increased by 1.5% in 2003, reversing a 2.0% decline in 2002, reflecting the improving U.S. economy and the impact that labor negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of 2002. The volume for our UPS Next Day Air products increased by 6.7% during the year, driven by double digit growth in overnight letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage refinancing activity during 2003. The increase in U.S. domestic average daily package volume was more significant in the latter half of the year. In the third and fourth quarters of 2003, total U.S. domestic average daily package volume increased 3.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The overall improvement in revenue per piece was primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in January 2003, with some additional benefit from the fuel surcharge as described below. The decline in revenue per piece for the Next Day Air products, and the relatively smaller increase for the deferred products, was primarily due to the relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the growth in package volume for these products. 18 Table of Contents On January 6, 2003, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.05 to $1.15 over the commercial ground rate. The additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain ZIP codes increased $0.25 to $1.75. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 3.4% and increased rates for deferred services by 4.5%. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the United States generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. During 2003, the index based fuel surcharge reset on a monthly basis and was based on the National U.S. Average On Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge increased to 1.47% in 2003 from 0.78% in 2002, resulting in an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of $144 million. Effective in 2004, we have discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service, while a new indexed surcharge is being applied to our Next Day Air and deferred products. This new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. This change will have a negative impact on revenue for our ground products, while having a beneficial impact on revenue for our Next Day Air and deferred products. U.S. domestic package operating profit declined $304 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to the slow volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating expenses (discussed further below under the section titled operating expenses and operating margin). U.S. domestic package operating profit increased 2.0% in the third quarter and decreased by 9.4% in the fourth quarter. However, in the fourth quarter of 2002, U.S. domestic package operating profit benefited from a $175 million credit due to a change in our vacation policy for non union employees. Without the vacation related credit in the 2002 results, fourth quarter operating profit would have increased 9.6% and the decline for the year ending December 31, 2003 would have been $129 million, or 3.8%. 2002 compared to 2001 U.S. domestic package revenue decreased $73 million, or 0.3%, for the year. This decrease was driven by a 1.9% decrease in average daily package volume, and partially offset by a 1.6% increase in revenue per piece. The decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors prior to the agreement reached on a new six year contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, combined with the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the July 31, 2002 expiration date of the previous contract. On January 7, 2002, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.5% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.10 over the commercial ground rate, and this charge also was applied to express deliveries in 2002. The additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain ZIP codes, remained at $1.50, and also was applied to express deliveries in 2002. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. We also increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 4.0%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $27.50 to $28.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout 2002 and varied by geographic market. An index based fuel surcharge, which began in February 2002 and reset on a monthly basis, replaced a fixed fuel surcharge of 1.25%. The indexed surcharge was based on the National U.S. Average On Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 0.78%. Approximately $251 million in revenue was recorded in 2002 as a result of our fuel surcharge, a decrease of $97 million from the prior year. 19 Table of Contents U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased $44 million, or 1.2%, for 2002, primarily due to the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an increase in operating expenses (discussed further below). In 2002, operating profit benefited from a credit to operating expense of $175 million that occurred related to a change in our vacation policy for non union employees. In 2001, we recorded a credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which benefited the U.S. domestic package segment by $28 million. International Package Operations 2003 compared to 2002 International package revenue improved $881 million, or 18.8%, for the year due primarily to the 8.6% volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements, a portion of which can be attributed to the impact of currency. Revenue increased $443 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Export volume increased throughout the world, with Asia Pacific, Canada, and the Americas showing double digit export volume growth, and U.S. and European export volume increasing slightly over 6%. European export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of the Euro and the weak European economy. Domestic volume increased 0.9% for the year, which reverses a 3.2% decline from the previous year, and was also negatively affected by the weak European economy. Export revenue per piece increased 12.5% for the year (3.3% currency adjusted), due to improvements in product mix and continued focus on yield management. In total, international average daily package volume increased 3.7% and average revenue per piece increased 17.4% (6.2% currency adjusted). The 7.6% decline in cargo revenue during the year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air network in the Americas. The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $387 million for the year, $117 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations. This increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously. In 2002, international operating profit benefited from an $11 million credit to operating expense as a result of a change in our vacation policy for non union employees. 2002 compared to 2001 For the year ended December 31, 2002, international package revenue improved $435 million, or 10.2% (8.1% currency adjusted), due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements. This volume growth was driven primarily by the Asia Pacific region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 17.1%, and the Europe region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 13.6%. In total, international average daily package volume increased 0.7% and average revenue per piece increased 9.1% (6.8% currency adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $197 million for the year, $22 million of which was due to currency fluctuations. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to export volume growth of 8.6% and a strong increase in revenue per piece. In addition, the shutdown of the U.S. West Coast ports during the latter part of 2002 had a beneficial impact on our international package results. In 2002, operating profit benefited from an $11 million reduction to expense related to the change in vacation policy. Operating profit in 2002 benefited, compared with 2001, from an $11 million reduction of expense due to the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, operating profit benefited from a $46 million credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. Non Package Operations 2003 compared to 2002 Non package revenue increased $234 million, or 8.8%, for the year. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, which comprises our former UPS Freight Services and UPS Logistics Group businesses, increased revenue by 8.0% during the year. This increase was due to growth in our supply chain management and other logistics businesses, with international revenues growing faster than in the U.S., partially as a result of favorable 20 Table of Contents currency fluctuations. Favorable currency fluctuations accounted for $74 million of the increase in revenue. Freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate, which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased air revenue in 2002 as a result of the work disruption at U.S. west coast ports. The remainder of our non package operations, which includes Mail Boxes Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes Etc. and The UPS Store), UPS Capital Corp., our mail and consulting services and our excess value package insurance business, increased revenue by 11.0% for the year, primarily due to increased franchise revenue at Mail Boxes Etc. and strong results from our Mail Innovations unit. Non package operating profit increased $266 million, or 134.3%, for the year. This increase was primarily due to higher operating profit from our Supply Chain Solutions unit, which was driven by the increase in revenue as well as the cost savings produced by our integration and restructuring program. Non package operating profit in 2002 was reduced by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses, and was increased by $11 million due to the change in our vacation policy for non union employees. Non package operating profit includes $114 million (compared to $112 million in 2002) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. During 2003, we sold our Mail Technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The gain consisted of a pre tax loss of $24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the non package segment, and a tax benefit of $38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale. The tax benefit exceeds the pre tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the Mail Technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes. Consequently, our tax basis was greater than our book basis, thus producing the tax benefit described above. Also during 2003, we sold our Aviation Technologies business unit and recognized a pre tax gain of $24 million ($15 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which is recorded in other operating expenses within the non package segment. The operating results of both the Mail Technologies unit and the Aviation Technologies unit were previously included in our non package segment, and were not material to non package operating results in any of the periods presented. 2002 compared to 2001 Non package revenue increased $589 million, or 28.3% during 2002. 20.4% of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was due to organic growth. UPS Supply Chain Solutions revenue was up $490 million, or 33.1%, for the year, much of which was due to having a full year of revenue from Fritz Companies Inc., which we acquired in May 2001, and other acquisitions. Revenue growth at Supply Chain Solutions was hindered by the sale of the FedEx brokerage business in March 2002. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, UPS Supply Chain Solutions would have reported revenue growth of approximately 8% during 2002. Non package operating profit decreased by $19 million, or 8.8%, for the year. In 2002, operating profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related expenses of $106 million primarily related to the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations, and an $11 million reduction to expense related to a change in our vacation policy for non union employees. Operating profit in 2002 benefited, compared with 2001, from a $61 million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization. Non package operating profit includes $112 million in 2002 (compared to $113 million in 2001) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. Operating Expenses and Operating Margin 2003 compared to 2002 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $1.864 billion, or 6.9%, for the year, $398 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and non package segments. Compensation and 21 Table of Contents benefits increased by $1.388 billion, or 7.7%, for the year, primarily due to increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. Stock based compensation expense totaled $724 million in 2003, a 14.0% increase over 2002, primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 for 2003 stock based compensation awards. Other operating expenses increased by $476 million, or 5.2%, for the year, largely due to a 12.3% increase in occupancy costs, a 10.3% increase in fuel expense, and smaller increases in purchased transportation, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation and amortization. Other operating expenses in 2002 were affected by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations into our UPS Supply Chain Solutions unit. The growth in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense on buildings and facilities, higher real estate taxes, and weather related increases in natural gas and utilities expense. The fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in 2003, somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage. The increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency and growth in our international package and Supply Chain Solutions businesses. The growth in depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new aircraft, the completion of facilities projects (including UPS Worldport), and increased amortization of capitalized software. The increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to higher vehicle, aircraft, and equipment maintenance expense. The increase in other expenses was due to a $75 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting from an impairment evaluation performed when we permanently removed a number of Boeing 727 and DC 8 aircraft from service. Of the total $75 million impairment charge, $69 million impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $6 million impacted the international package segment. Our operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, increased to 13.3% in 2003 from 13.1% in 2002. This increase is due to the growth in operating margin in our international package and non package segments, which benefited from the revenue increases described previously. The operating margin for our three business segments was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2002 Operating Segment 2003 Reported As Adjusted 2001 U.S. domestic package 13.1 % 14.9 % 14.2 % 15.1 % International package 12.7 % 6.9 % 6.6 % 2.9 % Non package 16.0 % 7.4 % 11.0 % 10.4 % 2002 adjusted operating margins exclude the effects of the vacation change, which increased operating profit (U.S. domestic $175 million, 0.7% effect on operating margin; international package $11 million, 0.3%; and non package $11 million, 0.4%), and the effects of the restructuring charge, which reduced non package operating profit by $106 million and operating margin by 4.0%. 2002 compared to 2001 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $817 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2002. Compensation and benefits increased $543 million, or 3.1%, due primarily to increased costs associated with health and retirement benefits. In 2002, compensation and benefits were reduced by the $197 million credit to expense related to the change in our vacation policy for non union employees. Other operating expenses increased by $274 million, or 3.1%, for the year. In 2002, other operating expenses were affected by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses. In 2002, depreciation and amortization benefited from the absence of $72 million of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, other operating expenses were reduced by $74 million for compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. The non package segment accounted for $513 million of the $817 million total increase in operating expenses. This was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of 2001. Our 22 Table of Contents consolidated operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, remained at 13.1% during 2001 and 2002. Investment Income/ Interest Expense 2003 compared to 2002 The decrease in investment income of $45 million in 2003 is primarily due to a $58 million impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of 2003. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a securitys fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. During the first quarter of 2003, after considering the continued decline in the U.S. equity markets, we recognized an impairment charge of $58 million, primarily related to our investment in S&P 500 equity portfolios. The $52 million decline in interest expense in 2003 was primarily the result of lower commercial paper balances outstanding, lower interest rates on variable rate debt, and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps. 2002 compared to 2001 The decrease in investment income of $96 million for 2002 is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment in 2002. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2003 compared to 2002 Net income for 2003 was $2.898 billion, a decrease of $284 million from the $3.182 billion achieved in 2002, resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share from $2.81 in 2002 to $2.55 in 2003. Net income in 2002 was favorably impacted by $776 million after tax ($0.68 per diluted share) resulting from the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability, and by $121 million after tax ($0.11 per diluted share) from the credit to expense as a result of the change in our vacation policy for non union employees. Net income in 2002 was adversely impacted by $65 million after tax ($0.06 per diluted share) due to the restructuring charge and related expenses and by $72 million after tax ($0.06 per diluted share) due to the FAS 142 cumulative expense adjustment. Excluding the effect of the preceeding items, net income for 2002 would have been $2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share. Net income in 2003 benefited from the $14 million after tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of our Mail Technologies unit in the second quarter of 2003, the $15 million after tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of our Aviation Technologies unit in the third quarter of 2003, and the $18 million after tax gain ($0.02 per diluted share) due to the redemption of our $300 million cash settled convertible senior notes. In addition, 2003 income tax expense was reduced by $55 million ($0.05 per diluted share) due to the resolution of various tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service during the first quarter, by $22 million ($0.02 per diluted share) due to a tax contingency accrual adjustment resulting from a favorable ruling on the tax treatment for jet engine maintenance costs during the third quarter, and by $39 million ($0.03 per share) due to a lower effective state tax rate in the fourth quarter. Net income in 2003 was adversely affected by the $37 million after tax ($0.03 per diluted share) investment impairment charge described previously. Excluding the effect of the preceeding items, net income for 2003 would have been $2.772 billion, or $2.44 per diluted share. This would represent a 14.0% increase in diluted earnings per share over the $2.14 achieved in 2002 (after taking into account the items discussed previously). 2002 compared to 2001 Net income for 2002 was $3.182 billion, an increase of $783 million from $2.399 billion in 2001, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.81 in 2002 from $2.10 in 2001. Net income in 2001 was adversely impacted by the FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment of $26 million after tax ($0.02 per diluted share), without which net income would have been $2.425 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share. In 2002, our 23 Table of Contents results were affected by the fourth quarter restructuring charge and related expenses of $65 million after tax ($0.06 per diluted share), the FAS 142 cumulative expense adjustment of $72 million after tax ($0.06 per diluted share), the credit to compensation and benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for non union employees of $121 million after tax ($0.11 per diluted share), and the credit related to the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability of $776 million after tax ($0.68 per diluted share). Excluding the effect of the preceeding items, net income for 2002 would have been $2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.646, $5.688 and $4.570 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in 2003 operating cash flows from 2002 was primarily the result of the funding of $1.1 billion into our pension plans during 2003. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, projected pension contributions in 2004 are approximately $426 million. In November 2003, we announced rate increases, which took effect on January 5, 2004. The overall impact is in line with previous years rate increases. We increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 1.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.25 to $1.40 over the commercial ground rate. An additional delivery area surcharge of $1.00 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain ZIP codes. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 2.9% and increased rates for deferred services by 2.9%. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.5%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. In addition, we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service, while a new index is being applied to our Next Day Air, deferred products, and international services. This new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. The index for shipments originating in Europe will be based on the Rotterdam ARA spot price of kerosene type jet fuel. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.942, $2.194 and $3.053 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary reason for these declines has been the slowing growth of our finance receivables portfolio, and the lack of business acquisitions during 2002 and 2003. Capital expenditures represent the primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Buildings and facilities $ 451 $ 528 $ 763 Aircraft and parts 1,019 638 932 Vehicles 161 41 303 Information technology 316 451 374 $ 1,947 $ 1,658 $ 2,372 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion in 2004. These expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. 24 Table of Contents Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $2.180, $2.090 and $1.493 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our primary use of cash in financing activities has been to repay long term debt, repurchase stock, and pay dividends. During 2003, we repaid over $1.2 billion in debt, primarily consisting of $492 million of commercial paper, $300 million in cash convertible notes, and $411 million in repayments of UPS Notes. Issuances of debt primarily consisted of UPS Notes. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt. In August 2003, a total of $1.0 billion was authorized for share repurchases as part of our continuing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2003, $858 million of this authorization was available for future share repurchases. We repurchased a total of $398 million of common stock in 2003. We increased our cash dividends per share to $0.92 in 2003 from $0.76 in 2002, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.026 billion from $840 million. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. In February 2004, the Board of Directors declared a $0.28 per share dividend, which represents a 12% increase over the $0.25 previous quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable on March 9, 2004 to shareowners of record on February 23, 2004. Sources of Credit We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $544 million was outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2003, with an average interest rate of 0.96%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability on our balance sheet. In addition, we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2003. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on April 22, 2004 and the other on April 24, 2008. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2003. We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2003. In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was approximately $85 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2003, all of which consists of issuances under our UPS Notes program. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, and purchase commitments. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow 25 Table of Contents from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 (in millions): Capitalized Operating Debt Purchase Year Leases Leases Principal Commitments 2004 $ 68 $ 314 $ 621 $ 858 2005 96 264 2 747 2006 69 187 2 833 2007 119 128 1 798 2008 128 99 27 697 After 2008 137 457 2,697 604 Total $ 617 $ 1,449 $ 3,350 $ 4,537 We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases, through 2009. Contingencies On August 9, 1999 the United States Tax Court Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The IRS took similar positions to those advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through 1998. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to EV package insurance. Under the terms of settlement, we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately $562 million, additions to tax of $60 million and related interest. The amount due to the IRS as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued. As a result, we recorded income, before taxes, of $1.023 billion ($776 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2002. The refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years. The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to the EV package insurance matters discussed above, regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses, the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. The proposed adjustments would result in $10 million of additional income tax. The IRS has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from 1991 through 1994. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $42 million in additional income tax. The IRSs proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest. We believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote. In November 2002, the IRS issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1995 through 1998. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $7 million in additional income tax. For the 1985 through 1998 tax years, unpaid interest on these adjustments through December 31, 2003 could aggregate up to approximately $178 million, after the benefit of related tax deductions. We expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2003. We believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are named as a defendant in twenty three pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for excess value (EV) insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted 26 Table of Contents as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive. These actions all were filed after the August 9, 1999 United States Tax Court decision, in which the Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues relating to EV package insurance. These twenty three cases have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation proceeding (MDL Proceeding) in federal court in New York. In addition to the cases in which UPS is named as a defendant, there also is an action, Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc., against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV insurance and related services purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers. This case also has been consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. While expressly denying any and all liability, the parties have obtained preliminary court approval of a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the MDL Proceeding. The proposed settlement requires several steps before it becomes final, including notice to the settlement class, and obtaining final court approval. If the proposed settlement becomes final, we would provide to qualifying settlement class members vouchers toward the purchase of specified UPS services and pay a portion of the plaintiffs attorneys fees, the total amount of which will be determined by the Court. The ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors. We do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans. Due to the events of September 11, 2001, increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions, including self insuring certain risks, to mitigate the expense increase. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 228,000 employees (64% of our total employees) employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which became amendable January 1, 2004. Negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the National Mediation Board. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do 27 Table of Contents not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was an asset (liability) of $30 and $34 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $17 and $38 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of $(48) and $(3) million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $97 and $42 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have various debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual 28 Table of Contents interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be approximately $25 and $28 million, respectively. As described in Note 1 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have certain investments in debt auction rate, and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be approximately $31 and $19 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables, that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of such investments was $95 and $322 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $10 million at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (FAS 146). FAS 146 provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred. This statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after January 1, 2003. As discussed in Note 17, we implemented a restructuring program involving the business unit integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. As this restructuring program was initiated in 2002, we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in EITF 94 3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). Therefore, the adoption of FAS 146 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of $106 million, which is classified in other operating expenses. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 were effective for financial statements ending after Decem 29 Table of Contents ber 15, 2002, while the recognition and initial measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet. In addition to numerous FASB Staff Positions written to clarify and improve the application of FIN 46, the FASB recently announced a deferral for certain entities, and an amendment to FIN 46 entitled FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 provides guidance for identifying the party with a controlling financial interest resulting from arrangements or financial instruments rather than voting interests. FIN 46 defines the term variable interest entity and is based on the premise that if a business enterprise absorbs a majority of such an entitys expected losses and or receives a majority of its expected residual returns, that enterprise has a controlling financial interest, and would thus require consolidation of the variable interest entity. As of December 31, 2003, we have adopted FIN 46, and the effects of adoption were not material to our results of operations or financial condition. On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement No. 149 Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 149). FAS 149 amends FAS 133 for certain decisions made by the FASB as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group process. FAS 149 also amends FAS 133 to incorporate clarifications of the definition of a derivative. The adoption of FAS 149 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement No. 150 Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity (FAS 150). FAS 150 establishes how an issuer measures certain freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity, and requires that such instruments be classified as liabilities. The adoption of FAS 150 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (FAS 132). The revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those required by the original standard about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. As revised, FAS 132 is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and we have included these disclosures in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. 30 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (FAS 142) in June 2001. As a result of the issuance of this new standard, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subjected to annual impairment testing. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. The estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors, including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $72 million ($0.06 per diluted share), as of January 1, 2002, related to our Mail Technologies business. The primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business. In conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in 2002, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $2 million related to our Mail Technologies business, resulting in total goodwill impairment of $74 million for 2002. Our annual impairment test performed in 2003 resulted in no goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2003, our recorded goodwill was $1.173 billion. Self Insurance Accruals We self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims, automotive liability, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits The Companys pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. The impact of decreasing the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets to 8.96% and the decrease in the discount rate to 6.25%, combined with other factors such as the additional fundings which occurred during 2003, will increase our pension plan expense by approximately $18 million in 2004. Financial Instruments As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the Market Risk section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over the counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $13.9 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. 31 Table of Contents In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. When appropriate, we evaluate our fixed assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In December 2003, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727 and DC 8 aircraft. As a result, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft. This charge is classified in the caption other expenses within other operating expenses (see Note 13). UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements: The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. The impact of competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates. The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with our competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations Possible disruptions of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline and fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant 32 Table of Contents quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. Item 7A.
