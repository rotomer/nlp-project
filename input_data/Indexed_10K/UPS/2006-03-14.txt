Ground volume grew 3.4%, and was positively impacted by a solid U.S. economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives. Next Day Air volume grew 2.8% and deferred volume increased 4.0%, with growth in the manufacturing, business services, telecommunications and retail sectors. The growth in total U.S. Domestic Package volume strengthened throughout the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 3.7% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2005, as well as the implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 2.0% for the year, primarily due to the rate increase and an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2005 compared to 2004. Next Day Air revenue per piece was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in our Saver product. Both Next Day Air and deferred revenue per piece were adversely affected by lighter average package weights. On January 3, 2005, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years rate increases. We increased rates 2.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select, and UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase of $0.25 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. The residential surcharge increased $0.10 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 10.23% in 2005, as compared with 7.07% in 2004. Additionally, an initial fuel surcharge of 2.00% was applied to UPS Ground services in January 2005, which fluctuates based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 2.90% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $683 million for the year, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume increases, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. These fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices, as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $791 million, or 21.4%, for the year, and domestic operating margin increased by 200 basis points. Operating profit increased by $274 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in Operating Expenses), which also favorably impacted the operating margin. The remaining increase in operating profit and margin resulted from the revenue growth described previously, as well as controlled growth of operating expenses. 2004 compared to 2003 U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.598 billion, or 6.3%, for the year, which resulted from a 3.3% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.1% increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume increased 4.0% during the year, driven in part by the improving U.S. economy, and reflects growth in both commercial and residential deliveries. Ground volume increased 4.8% during the first nine months of the year, but slowed to 1.5% during the fourth quarter. Total Next Day Air volume (up 0.8%) and total deferred volume (down 0.9%) were both significantly affected by declines in letter volume, but offset by an increase in Next Day Air package volume. The 2004 decline in Next Day Air and deferred letter volume is largely due to the slowdown in mortgage refinancing, which was notably strong in 2003. 20 Index to Financial Statements Ground revenue per piece increased 0.9% for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2004, but growth was adversely impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the removal of the fuel surcharge on ground products, as discussed below. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 6.6%, while deferred revenue per piece increased 6.0%, primarily due to the shift in product mix from letters to packages, the rate increase, and the modified fuel surcharge on domestic air products. On January 5, 2004, we increased rates for standard ground shipments by an average of 1.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.25 to $1.40 over the commercial ground rate. An additional delivery area surcharge of $1.00 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain ZIP codes. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 2.9% and increased rates for deferred services by 2.9%. In addition, in 2004 we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground products, while we began to apply a new indexed surcharge to domestic air products. This indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge applied to our air products during 2004 was 7.07%, compared with the average surcharge of 1.47% applied to both air and ground products in 2003, resulting in an increase in domestic fuel surcharge revenue of $290 million during the year. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $45 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to the increase in volume and revenue growth discussed previously, but was somewhat offset by increased aircraft impairment charges ($91 million in 2004 compared to $69 million in 2003) and a $63 million pension charge related to the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. Domestic operating margin declined 70 basis points, and was impacted by the aircraft impairment and pension charges noted above, as well as the sale of our Aviation Technologies business unit. During the third quarter of 2003, we sold our Aviation Technologies business unit and recognized a pre tax gain of $24 million ($15 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which is recorded in other operating expenses within the U.S. Domestic Package segment. The operating results of the Aviation Technologies unit were previously included in our U.S. Domestic Package segment, and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented. International Package Operations 2005 compared to 2004 International Package revenue improved $1.168 billion, or 17.2%, for the year, primarily due to the 13.9% volume growth for our export products and revenue per piece improvements. The improvements in revenue per piece were impacted by rate changes, currency fluctuations, and the fuel surcharge applied to international shipments. Revenue increased $121 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity, and also increased by $133 million during the year due to business acquisitions. In January 2005, we increased rates 2.9% for international shipments originating in the United States, which includes our Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard services. Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on U.S. export products by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $258 million during the year, due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. 21 Index to Financial Statements Export volume increased throughout the world, with strong growth in Asia and Europe. Asian export volume, which increased 29% for the year, was driven by export growth from China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international delivery network, including the additional flights from Shanghai, China that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004, and express air service between the U.S. and Guangzhou, China that began in the second quarter of 2005. European export volume increased 13% for the year, while export volume from the U.S. and Americas also showed solid increases. International domestic volume increased 12.4% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume increased 3.7%. Export revenue per piece increased 3.1% for the year (1.4% currency adjusted), due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge, but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product. In total, international average daily package volume increased 13.0% and average revenue per piece increased 4.0% (2.4% currency adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package operations was $345 million for the year, or 30.0%, with an increase in the operating margin of 180 basis points. This increase in operating profit and margin was positively impacted by the strong volume growth described previously, as well as better network utilization due to volume growth and geographic service expansion. The increase in operating profit was also favorably affected by $78 million due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense (net of hedging activity), and by $45 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in Operating Expenses). Operating profit was negatively affected in 2005 by $23 million in currency repatriation losses, as compared with repatriation gains of $32 million in 2004. 2004 compared to 2003 International Package revenue improved $1.200 billion, or 21.4%, for the year primarily due to the 12.5% volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements. Revenue increased $295 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Revenue growth was also impacted by the change to our fuel surcharge (discussed below) as well as rate changes, which vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.5%. In January 2004, changes were made to the calculation of our fuel surcharge on international products (including U.S. export products). The surcharge began to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending on where the shipment takes place. The surcharge began to be applied only to our international express products, while the previous surcharge was applied to all international products. These changes, along with higher fuel prices, had the effect of increasing International Package revenue by $231 million during the year. We experienced double digit export volume growth in each region throughout the world, with the Asia Pacific region leading with 24% export volume growth, including a 101% increase in China export volume. Export volume continued to benefit from our expanding international network, such as the six additional flights to Shanghai, China that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004. European export volume grew in excess of 10%, and was positively influenced by the addition of 10 countries to the European Union during the year. Non U.S. domestic volume increased 3.7% for the year, and primarily reflected improvements in our European and Canadian domestic delivery businesses. Export revenue per piece increased 8.7% for the year (2.9% currency adjusted), benefiting from rate increases and the impact of the fuel surcharge. In total, international average daily package volume increased 7.0% and average revenue per piece increased 13.4% (6.5% currency adjusted). 22 Index to Financial Statements The improvement in operating profit for our International Package operations was $417 million, or 57.0%, for the year, $54 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations. The remaining increase in operating profit was primarily due to the solid export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously, and a strong 380 basis point increase in operating margin primarily due to better network utilization. International operating profit was adversely affected by aircraft impairment charges of $19 million in 2004, compared to a $6 million charge in 2003. Supply Chain & Freight Operations 2005 compared to 2004 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $3.181 billion, or 113.1%, for the year. Forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by $2.358 billion during the year, largely due to the acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding in December 2004. The growth in our existing forwarding services and logistics businesses (excluding Menlo Worldwide Forwarding) was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations. Revenue increased by $17 million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations. Overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world, as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution. During the third quarter of 2005, we completed our acquisition of Overnite Corp., now known as UPS Freight, which offers a variety of less than truckload (LTL) and truckload services to customers in North America. Overnites results have been included in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment since the August 5, 2005 acquisition date. Overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the post acquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of UPS, including improvements in average daily LTL shipments and average LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our mail and consulting services, and our financial business, increased revenue by 6.0% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue at our mail and financial services units. Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment increased by $18 million, or 13.0%, for the year, largely due to the operating profits generated by Overnite. Operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding operations, as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business. Currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by $4 million during the year. Operating profit also was favorably impacted by $15 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in Operating Expenses). 2004 compared to 2003 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $299 million, or 11.9%, for the year. Freight services and logistics revenue increased by 11.9% during the year, with strong growth in our air and ground freight forwarding businesses, as well as our logistics business. The acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, which was completed in December 2004, increased freight services and logistics revenue by $33 million. Favorable currency fluctuations provided $73 million of the increase in revenue for the year. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which includes our retail franchising business, our mail and consulting services, and our financial business, increased revenue by 11.9% for the year, largely due to strong double digit franchise and royalty revenue growth at our retail franchising business resulting from an expanding store base. Supply Chain & Freight operating profit increased $82 million, or 146.4%, and operating margin increased by 270 basis points for the year, primarily due to improved results from our financial business (largely due to a lower loan loss provision), and our mail services business, which was affected in 2003 by the sale of our Mail Technologies business unit as described in the next paragraph. Our retail franchising business also experienced profit growth, due to the increased franchise and royalty revenue noted previously. These increases were partially offset by somewhat lower profits at our freight services and logistics operations. 23 Index to Financial Statements During the second quarter of 2003, we sold our Mail Technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The gain consisted of a pre tax loss of $24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the Supply Chain & Freight segment, and a tax benefit of $38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale. The tax benefit exceeded the pre tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the Mail Technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes. Consequently, our tax basis was greater than our book basis, thus producing the tax benefit described above. The operating results of the Mail Technologies unit were previously included in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented. Operating Expenses 2005 compared to 2004 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.845 billion, or 15.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite. Operating expenses also increased $56 million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations (net of hedging activity) in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments, and increased $55 million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our International Package segment. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.694 billion, or 8.1%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans. Stock based and other management incentive compensation expense decreased $297 million, or 33.4%, in the year, due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program implemented in 2005, described in the next paragraph, which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 beginning with 2003 stock based compensation awards. During the first quarter of 2005, we modified our Management Incentive Awards program under our Incentive Compensation Plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units (RSUs). The RSUs granted in November 2005 under this program have a five year graded vesting period, with approximately 20% of the total RSU award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The other half of the award granted in November 2005 was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of Class A common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant. Previous awards under the Management Incentive Awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant. This change had the effect of lowering 2005 expense. As a result, 2005 expense for our Management Incentive Awards program (reported in operating expenses under compensation and benefits), including the RSUs, decreased $334 million ($213 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share) compared with 2004. Other operating expenses increased by $3.151 billion, or 29.3%, for the year, largely due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite acquisitions, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The 47.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as higher fuel usage, but was partially mitigated with hedging gains. The 96.7% increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, but was also influenced by volume growth in our International Package business and higher fuel prices. The 9.2% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts (partially affected by the Overnite acquisition), airframe and aircraft engine maintenance. The 6.5% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings (largely due to acquisitions), aircraft, and capitalized software. The 16.0% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, which was impacted by the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, and increased utilities expense. The 4.5% increase in other expenses was primarily due to the Overnite acquisition, but partially offset by the absence in 2005 of the $110 million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in 2004. 24 Index to Financial Statements 2004 compared to 2003 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $2.553 billion, or 8.8%, for the year, $311 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.572 billion, or 8.2%, for the year, largely due to increased payroll costs, increased health and welfare expense, and higher pension expense for our union pension plans. Stock based compensation expense increased $167 million, or 23.2%, during the year, primarily as a result of increased Management Incentive Awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 prospectively beginning with 2003 stock based compensation awards. Other operating expenses increased by $981 million, or 10.0%, for the year, largely due to a 34.9% increase in fuel expense and a 12.6% increase in purchased transportation, but were somewhat offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in fuel expense was primarily due to higher prices for Jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, in addition to somewhat higher fuel usage and lower hedging gains. The increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency, higher fuel prices, and volume growth in our international package business. The decline in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by lower depreciation expense on aircraft engines, largely due to the retirement of some older aircraft. The increase in repairs and maintenance expense was affected by increased expense on vehicle parts and airframe and engine maintenance. The increase in other occupancy expense was largely related to higher rent expense, but somewhat offset by lower real estate taxes. The increase in other expenses was affected by the $110 million impairment of aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as the $63 million pension charge discussed previously, in addition to higher advertising costs. Investment Income and Interest Expense 2005 compared to 2004 The increase in investment income of $22 million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing short term interest rates in the United States, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest earning investments, increased equity method losses on certain investment partnerships, and an investment impairment charge on certain available for sale securities. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a securitys fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. After considering these factors, we recorded an impairment charge of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The $23 million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships. 2004 compared to 2003 Investment income increased by $64 million during the year, primarily due to a $58 million impairment charge recognized during 2003. During the first quarter of 2003, after considering the continued decline in the U.S. equity markets, we recognized an impairment charge of $58 million, primarily related to our investment in S&P 500 equity portfolios. Investment income also increased in 2004 due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances, but was somewhat offset by increased equity method losses on certain investment partnerships. The $28 million increase in interest expense during 2004 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and certain interest rate swaps, as well as the impact of currency exchange rates and imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships. The impact of higher interest rates was somewhat offset by lower average debt balances outstanding in 2004 compared to 2003. 25 Index to Financial Statements In December 2003, we redeemed $300 million in cash settled convertible senior notes at a price of 102.703, and also terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes. The redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption, which, along with the cash settlement received on the swap, resulted in a $28 million non operating gain recorded in 2003 results. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2005 compared to 2004 Net income for 2005 was $3.870 billion, a 16.1% increase from the $3.333 billion achieved in 2004, resulting in an 18.4% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.47 in 2005 from $2.93 in 2004. The increase in net income for 2005 was largely due to higher operating profit for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. Net income was adversely impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate to 36.3% in 2005 from 32.3% in 2004. The lower tax rate in 2004 was impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling $142 million ($0.13 per diluted share) related to various items, including the resolution of certain tax matters, the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards, and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items. Net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a $70 million after tax impairment charge ($0.06 per diluted share) on Boeing 727, 747, and McDonnell Douglas DC 8 aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as a $40 million after tax charge ($0.04 per diluted share) to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. 2004 compared to 2003 2004 net income was $3.333 billion, a 15.0% increase from the $2.898 billion in 2003, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.93 in 2004 from $2.55 in 2003. Net income in 2004 was impacted by the aircraft impairment, pension charge, and tax items discussed previously. Net income in 2003 was favorably impacted by the $14 million after tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of Mail Technologies, the $15 million after tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of Aviation Technologies, and the $18 million after tax gain ($0.02 per diluted share) recognized upon redemption of our $300 million cash settled senior convertible notes. Net income in 2003 was adversely impacted by the $37 million after tax investment impairment charge ($0.03 per diluted share) described previously. Net income in 2003 was also favorably impacted by reductions in income tax expense of $116 million ($0.10 per diluted share) due to the resolution of various tax issues with the IRS, a favorable court ruling on the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs, and a lower effective state tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.793, $5.331, and $4.576 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 operating cash flows compared with 2004 was primarily due to higher net income, but partially offset by higher pension and retirement plan fundings. In 2005, we funded $995 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to $585 million in 2004. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2006 are projected to be approximately $828 million. In 2005, we received a $374 million tax refund associated with the 1985 1990 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reached previously, primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance. In 2004, we received $610 million from a tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 1983 84 and 1991 98. On November 18, 2005, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on January 2, 2006. We increased rates 5.5% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 26 Index to Financial Statements 3.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased rates 5.5% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Other pricing changes include a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our Delivery Required and Signature Confirmation services. The residential surcharge increased $0.25 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years rate increases. Additionally, in January 2006 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The air fuel surcharge continues to remain subject to a maximum cap of 12.5%. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $975 million, $3.638 billion, and $2.742 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The decrease in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the net sales of marketable securities and short term investments to fund business acquisitions and the aforementioned benefit plan contributions. In 2005, we spent $1.488 billion on business acquisitions, primarily Overnite Corp., Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China. In 2004, we spent $238 million on business acquisitions, primarily Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. and the 49% minority interest in Yamato Express Co. in Japan (See Note 7). We expect to make additional payments related to business acquisitions of approximately $50 million during 2006, primarily related to the Sinotrans transaction. We generated cash of $95 and $318 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to the sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our leasing, asset based lending, and receivable factoring businesses. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Buildings and facilities $ 495 $ 547 $ 451 Aircraft and parts 874 829 1,019 Vehicles 456 393 161 Information technology 362 358 316 $ 2,187 $ 2,127 $ 1,947 As described in the Commitments section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $4.175, $2.014, and $2.110 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long term debt. In August 2005, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion for future share repurchases, in addition to the amount remaining under our October 2004 share repurchase authorization. We repurchased a total of 33.9 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.479 billion in 2005, and 18.1 million shares for $1.310 billion in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had $1.338 billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining. We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.33 per share in 2005 from $0.28 per share in 2004, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.391 billion from $1.208 billion. The declaration of 27 Index to Financial Statements dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. During 2005, we repaid $589 million in debt, primarily consisting of paydowns of commercial paper, scheduled principal payments on capital lease obligations, and repayments of debt that was previously assumed with the acquisitions of Lynx Express Ltd. and Overnite Corp. Issuances of debt were $128 million in 2005, and consisted primarily of loans related to our investment in certain equity method real estate partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt. Sources of Credit We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion in the United States. We had $739 million outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2005, with an average interest rate of 4.01%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to 1.0 billion in a variety of currencies. There were no amounts outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2005. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on April 20, 2006 and the other on April 21, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2005. In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was approximately $126 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2005, all of which consists of issuances under our UPS Notes program. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all covenant tests were satisfied as of December 31, 2005. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Year Capitalized Leases Operating Leases Debt Principal Purchase Commitments OtherLiabilities 2006 $ 64 $ 403 $ 774 $ 1,280 $ 48 2007 107 348 70 826 68 2008 115 248 37 738 69 2009 66 176 104 652 65 2010 61 126 30 478 62 After 2010 1 544 2,637 689 285 Total $ 414 $ 1,845 $ 3,652 $ 4,663 $ 597 28 Index to Financial Statements During 2005, we took delivery of six Boeing MD 11 aircraft and seven Airbus A300 600 aircraft. The final six firm Airbus A300 600 aircraft are scheduled for delivery by July 2006. We have firm commitments to purchase 13 Boeing MD 11 aircraft, and we expect to take delivery of these aircraft during 2006 and 2007. In 2005, we made firm commitments to purchase eight Boeing 747 400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2007 and 2008, and two Boeing 747 400SF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008. In addition, we have a firm commitment to purchase 10 Airbus A380 aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional A380 aircraft. The A380 aircraft deliveries are scheduled between 2009 and 2012. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.095 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. As of December 31, 2005, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $416 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full time supervisors. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. With the assistance of outside counsel, we have undertaken an internal investigation of certain conduct within our Supply Chain Solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the United States. Our investigation has determined that certain conduct, which commenced prior to our subsidiarys 2001 acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of Fritz Companies Inc., may have violated the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our investigation also determined that a small number of former employees directed the conduct in question. The monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial. We have implemented numerous remediation steps, and our investigation continues. In March 2006 we informed the SEC and the Department of Justice of our investigation, and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues. We do not believe that the results of this investigation, the remediation or related penalties, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 241,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood 29 Index to Financial Statements of Teamsters (Teamsters). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which became amendable December 31, 2003. Negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the National Mediation Board. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was an asset of $192 and $101 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $35 and $32 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net fair value of the hedging instruments 30 Index to Financial Statements described above was an asset (liability) of $52 and $(28) million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $65 and $117 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at both December 31, 2005 and 2004 would be approximately $29 million. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have certain investments in debt, auction rate, and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2005 and 2004 would be approximately $14 and $45 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2005 and 2004 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of such investments was $89 and $77 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $9 and $8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. 31 Index to Financial Statements New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123(R)), which replaces FAS 123 and supercedes APB 25. FAS 123(R) requires all share based awards to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured based on their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). We had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the original FAS 123, prospectively for all new stock compensation awards granted to employees subsequent to January 1, 2003. FAS 123(R) was effective beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005; the SEC deferred the effective date, and as a result, we adopted FAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006. On that date, there were no unvested stock options or other forms of employee stock compensation issued prior to January 1, 2003. We issue employee share based awards, under our Incentive Compensation Plan, that are subject to specific vesting conditions; generally, the awards cliff vest or vest ratably over a five year period, the nominal vesting period, or at the date the employee retires (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards that specify an employee vests in the award upon retirement, we account for the awards using the nominal vesting period approach. Under this approach, we record compensation expense over the nominal vesting period. If the employee retires before the end of the nominal vesting period, any remaining unrecognized compensation expense is recorded at the date of retirement. Upon our adoption of FAS 123(R), we will revise our approach to apply the non substantive vesting period approach to all new share based compensation awards. Under this approach, compensation cost will be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. We will continue to apply the nominal vesting period approach for any awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, and for the remaining portion of the then unvested outstanding awards. If we had accounted for all share based compensation awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 under the non substantive vesting period approach, the impact to our net income and earnings per share would have been immaterial for all prior periods. The adoption of the non substantive vesting period approach is expected to reduce 2006 net income by an estimated $29 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, based on share based awards that we are anticipating granting in 2006. The adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition: FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations; EITF 05 6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements; and FASB Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 32 Index to Financial Statements Contingencies As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Companys financial position as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2005, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill Impairment We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. We use a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the fair value of our goodwill. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2005, our recorded goodwill was $2.549 billion, of which $2.259 billion relates to our Supply Chain and Freight segment. This segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years, largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made. Because of its growth, this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies, resulting in higher volatility in our DCF model projections than for our other segments. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2005, 2004 and 2003 resulted in no goodwill impairment. Self Insurance Accruals We self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time 33 Index to Financial Statements the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. We use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Companys costs and obligations for the year 2005 (in millions): 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (54 ) $ 55 Effect on projected benefit obligation (548 ) 571 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (26 ) 26 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (5 ) 5 Effect on projected benefit obligation (77 ) 79 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 3 (2 ) Effect on projected benefit obligation 22 (14 ) Financial Instruments As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the Market Risk section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over the counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve 34 Index to Financial Statements volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the Market Risk section of this report. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $15.289 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144), we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). In December 2003, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC 8 aircraft. As a result, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft (including the related engines), $69 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $6 million of which impacted the international package segment. In December 2004, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727, 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC 8 aircraft. As a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft (including the related engines and parts), $91 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $19 million of which impacted the international package segment. These charges are classified in the caption other expenses within other operating expenses (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow, and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2005. Income Taxes We operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. We estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these 35 Index to Financial Statements jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes. The process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events, including the impact of adjustments, if any, resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. We recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years. Realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income (subject to any carry forward limitations) in the applicable jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based, in part, on estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established for the portion, if any, of the deferred tax assets that we conclude cannot be realized. Income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate. In this regard, we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters. During 2004 and 2003, the resolution of tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of $142 and $77 million, respectively. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words believes, expects, anticipates, we see, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements: The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business. The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased concerns about homeland security. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. 36 Index to Financial Statements Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. 37 Index to Financial Statements Item 7A.
