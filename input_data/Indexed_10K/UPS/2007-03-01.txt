Volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid U.S. economy, strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume. Overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of 2006 compared with 2005, due to slower overall economic growth in the U.S. and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter. Pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up 2.5% for the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 2.7% and Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 3.3% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2006 and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2006 compared to 2005. Deferred revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year for the same reasons, but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight, lower revenue packages. On January 2, 2006, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years rate increases. We increased rates 5.5% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 3.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our Delivery Required and Signature Confirmation services. The residential surcharge increased $0.25 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of 12.50% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 14.02% in 2006, as compared with 10.23% in 2005. Additionally, the UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.13% in 2006, as compared to 2.86% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $542 million in 2006, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume growth, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. These fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices, as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $430 million, or 9.6%, for the year, and the operating margin increased by approximately 50 basis points to 16.2%. This increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously, combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks. The 2006 operating profit for our U.S. Domestic Package segment was negatively impacted by a tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see Contingencies section below), which resulted in an $87 million charge to expense. The expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities was $83 million less in 2006 compared with 2005. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on ultimate reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. The lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors, including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies, improved oversight and management of claims, improved trends in health care costs, and favorable state legislative reforms, primarily in California. 23 Index to Financial Statements 2005 compared to 2004 U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.650 billion, or 6.1%, for the year, primarily due to a 3.4% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.5% increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume grew 3.4%, and was positively impacted by a solid U.S. economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives. Next Day Air volume grew 2.8% and deferred volume increased 4.0%, with growth in the manufacturing, business services, telecommunications and retail sectors. The growth in total U.S. Domestic Package volume strengthened throughout the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 3.7% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2005, as well as the implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 2.0% for the year, primarily due to the rate increase and an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2005 compared to 2004. Next Day Air revenue per piece was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in our Saver product. Both Next Day Air and deferred revenue per piece were adversely affected by lighter average package weights. On January 3, 2005, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years rate increases. We increased rates 2.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select, and UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase of $0.25 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. The residential surcharge increased $0.10 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. This fuel surcharge continued to be based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 10.23% in 2005, as compared with 7.07% in 2004. Additionally, an initial fuel surcharge of 2.00% was applied to UPS Ground services in January 2005, which fluctuated based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 2.86% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $683 million for the year, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume increases, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $791 million, or 21.4%, for the year, and domestic operating margin increased by 200 basis points. Operating profit increased by $274 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in Operating Expenses), which also favorably impacted the operating margin. The remaining increase in operating profit and margin resulted from the revenue growth described previously, as well as controlled growth of operating expenses. International Package Operations 2006 compared to 2005 International Package revenue improved $1.112 billion, or 13.9%, for the year, primarily due to the 11.9% volume growth for our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2005. Total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix, as lower yielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall international volume. The change in revenue was positively affected by $83 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. Revenue increased by $247 million during the year due to business acquisitions completed previously. In January 2006, we increased rates 5.5% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States varied by geographical market and occurred throughout the year. 24 Index to Financial Statements Also in January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S. related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of 12.5% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $189 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. Export volume increased throughout the world, with solid volume increases in Europe, Asia, and U.S. export products. Asian export volume continues to benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in Asia, while European export volume gains are impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the European Union. International domestic volume increased 21.0% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Stolica in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and the acquisition of Lynx in the U.K. during the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume and revenue increased 6.9% and 8.3%, respectively, for the year. Export revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year, largely due to the rate increases discussed previously, the impact of the fuel surcharge, and currency fluctuations, partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products. For the year, total international average daily package volume increased 17.3%, while average revenue per piece decreased 2.2% (decreased 3.3% currency adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package segment was $216 million for the year, or 14.5%, and the operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.8%. The increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth described previously. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $26 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. 2005 compared to 2004 International Package revenue improved $1.168 billion, or 17.2%, for the year, primarily due to the 13.9% volume growth for our export products and revenue per piece improvements. The improvements in revenue per piece were impacted by rate changes, currency fluctuations, and the fuel surcharge applied to international shipments. Revenue increased $121 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity, and also increased by $133 million during the year due to business acquisitions. In January 2005, we increased rates 2.9% for international shipments originating in the United States, which includes our Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard services. Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States varied by geographical market and occured throughout the year. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on U.S. export products by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $246 million during the year, due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. Export volume increased throughout the world, with strong growth in Asia and Europe. Asian export volume, which increased 29% for the year, was driven by export growth from China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international delivery network, including the additional flights from Shanghai, China that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004, and express air service between the U.S. and Guangzhou, China that began in the second quarter of 2005. European export volume increased 13% for the year, while export volume from the U.S. and Americas also showed solid increases. International domestic volume 25 Index to Financial Statements increased 12.4% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume increased 3.7%. Export revenue per piece increased 3.1% for the year (1.4% currency adjusted), due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge, but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product. In total, international average daily package volume increased 13.0% and average revenue per piece increased 4.0% (2.4% currency adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package operations was $345 million for the year, or 30.0%, with an increase in the operating margin of 180 basis points. This increase in operating profit and margin was positively impacted by the strong volume growth described previously, as well as better network utilization due to volume growth and geographic service expansion. The increase in operating profit was also favorably affected by $78 million due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense (net of hedging activity), and by $45 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in Operating Expenses). Operating profit was negatively affected in 2005 by $23 million in currency repatriation losses, as compared with repatriation gains of $32 million in 2004. Supply Chain & Freight Operations 2006 compared to 2005 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $2.008 billion, or 33.5%, for the year. UPS Freight, formerly known as Overnite Corp., provided $1.155 billion of the increase in revenue for the year. Excluding the impact of the Overnite acquisition in August 2005, segment revenues grew 16.4% for the year. Total average daily LTL shipments for UPS Freight in 2006 declined against the full year 2005 (both the pre and post acquisition period) due to service issues caused by the integration of the UPS Freight business, as well as a weakening in the overall LTL market in the United States in the latter half of 2006. LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $822 million, or 16.9% for the year, largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit. The forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on UPS, including increased utilization of UPS owned assets. This has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense. The increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives, which involved reducing less profitable accounts. In addition, revenue increased by $29 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business, increased revenue by 9.2% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue, as well as revenue earned from our previously announced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the U.S. Postal Service. For the year, the Supply Chain & Freight segment reported $2 million in operating profit, as compared with a $156 million in operating profit for 2005. These results were impacted by the integration of the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business into our air network, and the integration of the Motor Cargo business unit within the acquired Overnite Corp. operations into the UPS Freight network. The UPS Freight integration led to service issues, which resulted in a loss of revenue, as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs. The integration of the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover. The increase in operating profit was positively affected by $2 million during 2006 due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense. 26 Index to Financial Statements In an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. This restructuring plan is expected to generate efficiencies resulting in improved operating profits by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers. This restructuring involves plans to reduce non operating expenses by approximately 20%, including a reduction in non operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. As of December 31, 2006, $12 million in costs have been accrued related to employee severance. 2005 compared to 2004 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $3.181 billion, or 113.1%, for the year. Forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by $2.383 billion during the year, largely due to the acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding in December 2004. The growth in our existing forwarding services and logistics businesses (excluding Menlo Worldwide Forwarding) was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations. Revenue increased by $17 million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations. Overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world, as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution. During the third quarter of 2005, we completed our acquisition of Overnite Corp., now known as UPS Freight, which offers a variety of LTL and truckload services to customers in North America. Overnites results have been included in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment since the August 5, 2005 acquisition date. Overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the post acquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of UPS, including improvements in average daily LTL shipments and average LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our mail and consulting services, and our financial business, increased revenue by 0.3% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue at our mail and financial services units. Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment increased by $18 million, or 13.0%, for the year, largely due to the operating profits generated by Overnite. Operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding operations, as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business. Currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by $4 million during the year. Operating profit also was favorably impacted by $15 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in Operating Expenses). Operating Expenses 2006 compared to 2005 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.474 billion, or 12.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Overnite, Stolica, and Lynx. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by $84 million for the year. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.904 billion, or 8.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. These increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense, as previously discussed. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, compensation and benefits expense increased 5.1% for the year. Stock based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $49 million, or 8.0% in 2006, due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of 2005, the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of 2006, and the impact of adopting the non substantive vesting period approach of FAS 123R (discussed further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our Management Incentive Awards program in 2006. 27 Index to Financial Statements Other operating expenses increased by $2.570 billion, or 18.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in 2005 on the increase in operating expenses by category in 2006. Total % Increase Acquisition Impact % Increase without Acquisitions Other Operating Expenses: Repairs and maintenance 5.3 % 3.0 % 2.3 % Depreciation and amortization 6.3 % 3.1 % 3.2 % Purchased transportation 34.9 % 4.8 % 30.1 % Fuel 27.3 % 7.1 % 20.2 % Other occupancy 7.6 % 4.2 % 3.4 % Other expenses 8.5 % 3.9 % 4.6 % 18.5 % 4.5 % 14.0 % Excluding the effect of acquisitions, the 20.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet A, diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. The 30.1% increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our International Package business, currency fluctuations, higher fuel prices, increased rail costs, and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously. The 2.3% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs. The 3.2% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment, aircraft and engines, and higher amortization expense on intangible assets. The 3.4% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses. The increase in other expenses was impacted by several items, including the $87 million tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see Contingencies section below). 2005 compared to 2004 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.845 billion, or 15.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite. Operating expenses also increased $56 million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations (net of hedging activity) in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments, and increased $55 million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our International Package segment. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.694 billion, or 8.1%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans. Stock based and other management incentive compensation expense decreased $297 million, or 33.4%, in the year, due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program implemented in 2005, described in the next paragraph, which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 beginning with 2003 stock based compensation awards. During the first quarter of 2005, we modified our Management Incentive Awards program under our Incentive Compensation Plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units (RSUs). The RSUs granted in November 2005 under this program have a five year graded vesting period, with approximately 20% of the total RSU award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The other half of the award granted in November 2005 was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of Class A common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant. Previous awards under the Management Incentive Awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant. This change had the effect of lowering 2005 expense. As a result, 2005 expense for our Management Incentive Awards program (reported in operating expenses under compensation and benefits), including the RSUs, decreased $334 million ($213 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share) compared with 2004. 28 Index to Financial Statements Other operating expenses increased by $3.151 billion, or 29.3%, for the year, largely due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite acquisitions, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The 47.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as higher fuel usage, but was partially mitigated with hedging gains. The 95.5% increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, but was also influenced by volume growth in our International Package business and higher fuel prices. The 9.2% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts (partially affected by the Overnite acquisition), airframe and aircraft engine maintenance. The 6.5% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings (largely due to acquisitions), aircraft, and capitalized software. The 16.0% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, which was impacted by the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, and increased utilities expense. The 4.5% increase in other expenses was primarily due to the Overnite acquisition, but partially offset by the absence in 2005 of the $110 million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in 2004. Investment Income and Interest Expense 2006 compared to 2005 The decrease in investment income of $18 million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments, due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings, business acquisitions, and capital expenditures. This was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments, as well as the absence of any investment impairments during 2006 ($16 million of investment impairments were recognized in 2005, as described below). The $39 million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships. This was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during 2006, as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year. 2005 compared to 2004 The increase in investment income of $22 million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing short term interest rates in the United States, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest earning investments, increased equity method losses on certain investment partnerships, and an investment impairment charge on certain available for sale securities. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a securitys fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. After considering these factors, we recorded an impairment charge of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The $23 million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with real estate investment partnerships. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2006 compared to 2005 Net income for 2006 was $4.202 billion, an 8.6% increase from the $3.870 billion achieved in 2005, resulting in a 11.2% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.86 in 2006 from $3.47 in 2005. Net income in 2006 benefited from a $52 million reduction in income tax expense ($0.05 impact to diluted earnings per share) 29 Index to Financial Statements due to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non U.S. operations. Diluted earnings per share has increased at a faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program. The increase in net income for 2006 was largely due to higher operating profits for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. 2005 compared to 2004 Net income for 2005 was $3.870 billion, a 16.1% increase from the $3.333 billion achieved in 2004, resulting in an 18.4% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.47 in 2005 from $2.93 in 2004. The increase in net income for 2005 was largely due to higher operating profit for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. Net income was adversely impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate to 36.3% in 2005 from 32.3% in 2004. The lower tax rate in 2004 was impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling $142 million ($0.13 per diluted share) related to various items, including the resolution of certain tax matters, the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards, and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items. Net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a $70 million after tax impairment charge ($0.06 per diluted share) on Boeing 727, 747, and McDonnell Douglas DC 8 aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as a $40 million after tax charge ($0.04 per diluted share) to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.589, $5.793, and $5.331 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The decrease in 2006 operating cash flows compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher pension and retirement plan fundings, but partially offset by increased net income. In 2006, we funded $1.625 billion to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to $995 million in 2005. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2007 are projected to be approximately $581 million. In 2005, we received a $374 million tax refund associated with the 1985 1990 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reached previously, primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance. In 2004, we received $610 million from a tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 1983 84 and 1991 98. Additionally, we expect to pay a total of $69 million between 2007 and 2008 related to employees who accepted a recently announced special voluntary separation opportunity, which is discussed further in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. On November 17, 2006, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on January 1, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). We increased our Ground Hundredweight rates by an average of 5.9%. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and a $0.75 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years rate increases. Additionally, in January 2007 we will modify the fuel surcharge on domestic and U.S. origin international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $2.340 billion, $975 million, and $3.638 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increased cash used in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and fewer net sales of marketable securities and short term investments. During 2006, we 30 Index to Financial Statements sold a net $482 million in marketable securities and short term investments, primarily due to the pension and postretirement medical benefit plan fundings in the third quarter. During 2005, we sold a net $2.752 billion in marketable securities and short term investments, largely to fund the acquisition of Overnite as well as to make fundings to our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. In 2005, we spent $1.488 billion on business acquisitions, primarily Overnite Corp., Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). We generated cash of $68, $95, and $318 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively, due to the sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our leasing, asset based lending, and receivable factoring businesses. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash, which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through 2007. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Buildings and facilities $ 720 $ 495 $ 547 Aircraft and parts 1,150 874 829 Vehicles 831 456 393 Information technology 384 362 358 $ 3,085 $ 2,187 $ 2,127 As described in the Commitments section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $3.851, $4.175, and $2.014 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long term debt. In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion for future share repurchases, in addition to the amount remaining under our August 2005 share repurchase authorization. We repurchased a total of 32.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.455 billion in 2006 ($2.460 billion reported on statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements), and 33.9 million shares for $2.479 billion in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had $936 million of our share repurchase authorization remaining; in February 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion, which replaced the remaining amounts available under our July 2006 authorization. On February 8, 2007, our Board declared a dividend of $0.42 per share, which is payable on March 6, 2007 to shareowners of record on February 20, 2007. We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.38 per share in 2006 from $0.33 per share in 2005, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.577 billion from $1.391 billion. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. Issuances of debt during 2006 consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper, UPS Notes, and facility notes and bonds. Repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equity method partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt. 31 Index to Financial Statements Sources of Credit We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion in the United States. We had $791 million outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2006, with an average interest rate of 5.20%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to 1.0 billion in a variety of currencies. There were no amounts outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2006. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on April 19, 2007 and the other on April 21, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2006. In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was $136 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2006, all of which consists of issuances under our UPS Notes program. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all covenant tests were satisfied as of December 31, 2006. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in millions), including the Boeing 767 300ER order discussed further below: Year Capital Leases Operating Leases Debt Principal Debt Interest Purchase Commitments OtherLiabilities 2007 $ 75 $ 404 $ 918 $ 196 $ 1,072 $ 67 2008 75 335 27 170 988 78 2009 41 243 83 169 499 74 2010 62 168 30 165 1,022 71 2011 1 119 33 164 1,184 69 After 2011 505 2,766 2,849 1,636 270 Total $ 254 $ 1,774 $ 3,857 $ 3,713 $ 6,401 $ 629 Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. These lease obligations and commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2006. The calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. We have firm commitments to purchase four Boeing MD 11 aircraft, and we expect to take delivery of these aircraft during 2007. In February 2007, we announced an order for 27 Boeing 767 300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012 (this order is 32 Index to Financial Statements reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above). We also have firm commitments to purchase eight Boeing 747 400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2007 and 2008, and two Boeing 747 400BCF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. In addition, we currently have a firm commitment to purchase 10 Airbus A380 800 freighter aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional A380 800 aircraft (this order is reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above). In February 2007, we announced that we had signed an agreement with Airbus to set out a timetable for deciding the status of this previous order. The agreement specifies changed delivery dates for the A380 800 and provides for possible termination of the original purchase agreement by either party later in 2007. The revised delivery schedule specifies the delivery dates for the 10 Airbus A380 800s on order as being between 2012 and 2013, whereas we were originally scheduled to take delivery of the Airbus A380 800 aircraft between 2009 and 2012. The signing of this agreement will have no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. The contractual payments due under the other liabilities column includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The commitments above exclude our planned pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions, as we do not have any material funding requirements for our UPS sponsored pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2006. In 2007, we plan to contribute $533 million to our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans and $48 million to our international pension plans. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute amounts annually that are at least equal to the amounts required by applicable laws and regulations, or to directly fund payments to plan participants, as applicable. International pension plans will be funded in accordance with local regulations. We have also guaranteed our obligations for certain international pension plans up to a maximum amount of $118 million. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.213 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. As of December 31, 2006, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $604 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full time supervisors. The court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims and plaintiffs have appealed. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In another case, Cornn v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and or overtime and meal and rest periods. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately 23,600 drivers and seek back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys fees. UPS has agreed in principle to settle this matter in full for a total payment of $87 million. On December 6, 2006, the court granted tentative approval of the settlement. 33 Index to Financial Statements We are named as a defendant in four putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts, alleging a conspiracy relating to certain surcharges by a number of air cargo carriers. We are not named as a defendant in at least eighty six related cases that make similar allegations. These cases have been consolidated in a Multi District Litigation proceeding pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. UPS was not included as a defendant in the amended consolidated complaint on which the Multi District Litigation is proceeding. In addition, in July 2006, we were named as a defendant in a comparable lawsuit filed in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases. We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 246,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. In the third quarter of 2006, we began formal negotiations with the Teamsters on a new agreement. We have approximately 2,800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association (IPA). On June 30, 2006, UPS and the IPA announced a tentative agreement on a new labor contract, which was ratified in the third quarter. This new contract becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1, 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 on October 2, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Other Matters On July 14, 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The subpoena relates to the DOJs publicly announced criminal investigation of the air cargo pricing practices of a number of domestic and foreign airlines. We do not believe that we are a target of this investigation and we intend to cooperate. With the assistance of outside counsel, we investigated certain conduct within our Supply Chain Solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the United States. Our investigation determined that certain conduct, which commenced prior to our subsidiarys 2001 acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of Fritz Companies Inc., may have violated the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial. We have implemented numerous remediation steps. We informed the SEC and the DOJ of our investigation, and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues. We do not believe that the results of this investigation, the remediation or related penalties, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not 34 Index to Financial Statements engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was an asset of $10 and $192 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $8 and $35 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through 2007. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset of $30 and $52 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $183 and $65 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. 35 Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be approximately $29 million each year. We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be approximately $12 and $14 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of such investments was $80 and $89 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $8 and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)) (FAS 158). This statement requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. 36 Index to Financial Statements FAS 158 also requires delayed recognition items, consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158. The effect of adopting FAS 158 on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 has been included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, while there was no effect on our balance sheet for prior periods. Additionally, we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under Statement No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions, and we measure the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we will be required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans no later than 2008. We do not expect the impact of the change in measurement date to have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109). This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, financial statement classification, tax related interest and penalties, and additional disclosure requirements. We are required to adopt this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements. Any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 was issued to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. The adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition: FSP AUG AIR 1 Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities; FAS 156 Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets; and FSP FAS 13 2 Accounting for a Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Related to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. 37 Index to Financial Statements The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Companys financial position as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2006, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill Impairment We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. We use a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the fair value of our goodwill. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2006, our recorded goodwill was $2.533 billion, of which $2.243 billion relates to our Supply Chain and Freight segment. This segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years, largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made. Because of its growth, this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies, resulting in higher volatility in our DCF model projections than for our other segments. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2006, 2005 and 2004 resulted in no goodwill impairment. Self Insurance Accruals We self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. We use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans. These liabilities and related expenses are based on 38 Index to Financial Statements estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Companys costs and obligations for the year 2006 (in millions): 25 Basis PointIncrease 25 Basis PointDecrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (67 ) $ 68 Effect on projected benefit obligation (571 ) 595 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (31 ) 31 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (7 ) 7 Effect on projected benefit obligation (83 ) 86 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 3 (2 ) Effect on projected benefit obligation 17 (16 ) Financial Instruments As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 15 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the Market Risk section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over the counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the Market Risk section of this report. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets As of December 31, 2006, we had $16.779 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we 39 Index to Financial Statements make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144), we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations. In December 2004, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727, 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC 8 aircraft. As a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2004 for these aircraft (including the related engines and parts), $91 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $19 million of which impacted the international package segment. This charge was classified in the caption other expenses on the income statement. UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow, and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2006 or 2005. Income Taxes We operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. We estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes. The process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events, including the impact of adjustments, if any, resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. We recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years. Realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income (subject to any carry forward limitations) in the applicable jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based, in part, on estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate. In this regard, we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters. 40 Index to Financial Statements During the third quarter of 2006, we recognized a $52 million reduction of income tax expense related to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non U.S. operations. During 2004, the resolution of tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of $142 million. Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words believes, expects, anticipates, we see, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements: The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business. The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. 41 Index to Financial Statements Item 7A.
