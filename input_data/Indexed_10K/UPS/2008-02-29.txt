Next Day Air volume increased 0.8% and Ground volume increased 0.6% for the year, largely as a result of a solid peak season in the fourth quarter, when our Next Day Air volume rose 2.2% and Ground volume increased 1.5%. Deferred air volume declined 1.9% in 2007. Our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing U.S. economy and weak small package market in 2007. Trends in U.S. industrial production and business to consumer shipments in 2007 have not been favorable to the overall small package market, which places pressure on our domestic package volume. The increase in overall revenue per piece of 1.6% in 2007 resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year, but was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix. Next Day Air revenue per piece declined 0.9%, and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our lower yielding Next Day Air Saver products. Deferred revenue per piece increased only 0.4%. The change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate (discussed further below). Ground revenue per piece increased 2.9%, primarily due to the rate increase, but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in 2007 compared with 2006. Overall product mix reduced revenue per piece, as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground volume grew 0.6%. Consistent with the practice in previous years, a rate increase took effect on January 1, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and a $0.75 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts. In January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 12.17% in 2007, a decline from the 14.02% in 2006, primarily due to the 2% reduction in the index. The ground fuel surcharge rate continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.30% in 2007, an increase from 4.13% in 2006, due to higher diesel fuel prices. As a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements, total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by $110 million in 2007. U.S. Domestic Package incurred an operating loss of $1.531 billion in 2007, compared with a $4.923 billion operating profit in 2006, largely due to a $6.100 billion charge related to our withdrawal from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (Central States Pension Fund). Additionally, Domestic Package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue growth, an aircraft impairment charge, and a special voluntary separation opportunity (SVSO) charge. The aircraft impairment and SVSO charges reduced domestic operating profit by $159 million and $53 million, respectively. These factors were partially offset by cost controls, including, among other categories, lower self insurance expense. The expense associated with our self insurance 23 accruals for workers compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors. The Central States Pension Fund withdrawal, aircraft impairment, and SVSO charges, as well as the impact of lower self insurance expense, are discussed further in the Operating Expenses section. 2006 compared to 2005 U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.846 billion, or 6.5%, for the year, with average daily package volume up 4.4%. Volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid U.S. economy, strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume. Overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of 2006 compared with 2005, due to slower overall economic growth in the U.S. and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter. Pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up 2.5% for the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 2.7% and Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 3.3% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2006 and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2006 compared to 2005. Deferred revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year for the same reasons, but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight, lower revenue packages. On January 2, 2006, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years rate increases. We increased rates 5.5% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 3.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our Delivery Required and Signature Confirmation services. The residential surcharge increased $0.25 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of 12.50% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. This fuel surcharge continued to be based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 14.02% in 2006, as compared with 10.23% in 2005. Additionally, the UPS Ground fuel surcharge continued to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.13% in 2006, as compared to 2.86% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $542 million in 2006, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume growth, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. These fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices, as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $430 million, or 9.6%, for the year, and the operating margin increased by approximately 50 basis points to 16.2%. This increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously, combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks. The 2006 operating profit for our U.S. Domestic Package segment was negatively impacted by the settlement of a class action litigation (see Contingencies section below), which resulted in an $87 million charge to expense. Operating profit for this segment was positively affected as a result of lower expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities in 2006 compared with 2005. International Package Operations 2007 compared to 2006 International Package revenue improved $1.192 billion, or 13.1% in 2007, driven by a 10.4% volume increase for our export products and an 8.3% increase in total revenue per piece. The growth in revenue per piece 24 was positively impacted by base rate increases and the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against several major foreign currencies in 2007, but was adversely affected by a lower fuel surcharge rate applied to our U.S. origin international air products. Export volume increased throughout the world. Asian export volume grew strongly in key markets during the year, especially China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion, as well as strong economic growth, which benefits our intra Asian package business. To continue this expansion, we received authority in 2007 to operate six daily flights between the U.S. and Nagoya, Japan. We are also constructing a package and freight air hub in Shanghai, China that is expected to open in 2008. This hub will link Shanghai to our international air network, with direct service to Europe, Asia, and the Americas. European export volume also grew solidly, largely due to continued growth in the transborder business and improved economic and industrial output in the European Union. U.S. export volume increased at a slower pace. Non U.S. domestic volume increased 2.2% for the year, and was impacted by growth in several major European countries and Canada. Export revenue per piece increased 3.9% for the year, largely due to rate increases and favorable exchange rates, but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products, and a reduction in certain fuel surcharge rates. Non U.S. domestic revenue per piece increased 9.6% for the year, and was affected by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. Total average revenue per piece increased 2.7% on a currency adjusted basis, and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by $464 million in 2007 due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. In January 2007, we increased rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. Also in January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S. related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $12 million during the year due to increased volume, but was partially offset by the reduction in the fuel surcharge index. International Package operating profit increased $121 million, or 7.1%, for the year, primarily due to the volume and revenue per piece improvements described above. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $153 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, net of hedging activity. International Package operating profit was adversely affected in 2007 by charges related to the aircraft impairment ($62 million) and the SVSO ($7 million), both of which are discussed further in the Operating Expenses section. Operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel, as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense. The adverse impact of the aircraft impairment, SVSO charge, and fuel were the primary causes of the 100 basis point decline in operating margin to 17.8%. 2006 compared to 2005 International Package revenue improved $1.112 billion, or 13.9%, for the year, primarily due to the 11.9% volume growth for our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2005. Total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix, as lower yielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall international volume. The change in revenue was positively affected by $83 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. Revenue increased by $247 million during the year due to business acquisitions completed previously. 25 In January 2006, we increased rates 5.5% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States varied by geographical market and occurred throughout the year. Also in January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S. related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of 12.5% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment took place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $189 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. Export volume increased throughout the world, with solid volume increases in Europe, Asia, and U.S. export products. Asian export volume continued to benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in Asia, while European export volume gains were impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the European Union. International domestic volume increased 21.0% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Stolica in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and the acquisition of Lynx in the U.K. during the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume and revenue increased 6.9% and 8.3%, respectively, for the year. Export revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year, largely due to the rate increases discussed previously, the impact of the fuel surcharge, and currency fluctuations, partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products. For the year, total international average daily package volume increased 17.3%, while average revenue per piece decreased 2.2% (decreased 3.3% currency adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package segment was $216 million for the year, or 14.5%, and the operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.8%. The increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth described previously. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $26 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Supply Chain & Freight Operations 2007 compared to 2006 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $424 million, or 5.3%, in 2007. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $230 million, or 4.0%, for the year, and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements and revenue management initiatives begun in 2006. Favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by $178 million during the year. Revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight and mail services, which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates. UPS Freight increased revenue $156 million, or 8.0%, for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume. Average LTL shipments per day increased 8.3% during the year, driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package customer base for new sales opportunities. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 9.3% during the year, due to an increase in base rates in 2007 and a focus on higher yielding customer segments. The increase in revenue per hundredweight and average daily shipments were somewhat offset by a 7.5% decrease for the year in the LTL weight per shipment. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our financial business, and our U.S. domestic cargo operations, increased revenue by 10.3% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service. 26 Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment was $278 million in 2007, compared with a profit of $2 million in 2006, resulting in a 330 basis point improvement in the operating margin. This improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business as a result of cost controls, a focus on asset utilization, and revenue management initiatives. Cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in 2006, which included a reduction of non operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. Additionally, margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business, through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft. Finally, revenue management initiatives put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts, and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets. Operating profit in 2007 for this segment was reduced by $46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non core business units in France, as well as by $8 million due to the SVSO charge. These charges are discussed further in the Operating Expenses section. Currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by $18 million in 2007. 2006 compared to 2005 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $2.008 billion, or 33.5%, for the year. UPS Freight, formerly known as Overnite Corp., provided $1.155 billion of the increase in revenue for the year. Excluding the impact of the Overnite acquisition in August 2005, segment revenues grew 16.4% for the year. Total average daily LTL shipments for UPS Freight in 2006 declined against the full year 2005 (both the pre and post acquisition period) due to service issues caused by the integration of the UPS Freight business, as well as a weakening in the overall LTL market in the United States in the latter half of 2006. LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $822 million, or 16.9% for the year, largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit. The forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on UPS, including increased utilization of UPS owned assets. This has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense. The increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives, which involved reducing less profitable accounts. In addition, revenue increased by $29 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business, increased revenue by 9.2% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue, as well as revenue earned from our previously announced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the U.S. Postal Service. For the year, the Supply Chain & Freight segment reported $2 million in operating profit, as compared with a $156 million in operating profit for 2005. These results were impacted by the integration of the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business into our air network, and the integration of the Motor Cargo business unit within the acquired Overnite Corp. operations into the UPS Freight network. The UPS Freight integration led to service issues, which resulted in a loss of revenue, as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs. The integration of the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover. The increase in operating profit was positively affected by $2 million during 2006 due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense. In an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. This restructuring plan was designed to generate efficiencies, resulting in improved operating profits, by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers. This restructuring involved the reduction of non operating expenses by approximately 20%, including a reduction in non operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. We incurred $12 million in expenses in 2006 related to employee severance. 27 Operating Expenses 2007 compared to 2006 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $8.202 billion, or 20.0%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by $471 million for the year. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $7.324 billion for the year, and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, higher wage rates in the union workforce, increased stock based compensation, higher expense for union pension and welfare programs, the SVSO charge, and the restructuring charge in our Supply Chain & Freight business in France. These increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense. Our national master agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters) allowed us, upon ratification, to withdraw employees from the Central States Pension Fund and to establish a jointly trusteed single employer plan for this group. Upon ratification of the contract in December 2007 and our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, we recorded a pre tax $6.100 billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability, and made a December 2007 payment in the same amount to the Central States Pension Fund to satisfy this liability. In December 2006, we offered a special voluntary separation opportunity (SVSO) to approximately 640 employees who work in non operating functions. This program was established to improve the efficiency of non operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company. The SVSO ended in February 2007, and 195, or 30% of eligible employees, accepted the offer. As a result, we recorded a charge to expense of approximately $68 million in the first quarter of 2007, to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the SVSO program. In the third quarter of 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in France. The objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the Europe region. The restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program, which was ratified by our companys trade union representatives in France in July 2007. Employees participating in this program are entitled to severance benefits, including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase. These severance benefits are formula driven and are in accordance with French statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements. We recorded a restructuring charge of $46 million ($42 million related to severance costs, and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense) in 2007 related to this program. Stock based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $113 million, or 17.7%, during 2007, primarily due to 2007 awards of stock options, restricted performance units, and restricted stock units. Pension and healthcare expense increased during the year, largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees, but was somewhat offset by lower expense for the UPS sponsored pension benefits (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). During the first quarter of 2005, we modified our Management Incentive Awards program under our Incentive Compensation Plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units, with certain exceptions for first time participants in the program. The restricted stock units granted each year under this program generally have a five year graded vesting period, with approximately 20% of the total restricted stock unit award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The other half of the Management Incentive Award granted each year is in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of Class A common stock and is fully vested at the time of grant. Previous awards under the Management Incentive Awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, we recognize the expense associated with restricted stock unit awards over the appropriate vesting 28 period. We anticipate that this change in the award structure will have the effect of increasing the expense recognized for our restricted stock unit grants in future years, until approximately 2010, when we the effect of expensing new restricted stock unit grants will be somewhat offset with the elimination of expense from awards that have become completely vested. The expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities was $46 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. The lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors, including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies, improved oversight and management of claims, improved trends in health care costs, and favorable state legislative reforms. The 0.2% increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft, largely offset by lower maintenance expense on vehicles and buildings. The 0.2% decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors, including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software, partially offset by increased depreciation expense on vehicles. The 7.4% increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our International Package business and currency fluctuations, as well as growth in our international forwarding business. The 12.0% increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel, as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. Other occupancy expense increased 2.1% for the year, and was affected by increased rent expense and property taxes, but partially offset by lower utilities expense. The 3.0% increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a $221 million aircraft impairment charge, discussed further below, but partially offset with cost controls in several areas. The comparison in other expenses was also affected by the $87 million charge in the Cornn class action litigation in 2006 (see Contingencies section). As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. This charge is included in the caption Other expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income, of which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment. 2006 compared to 2005 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.474 billion, or 12.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Overnite, Stolica, and Lynx. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by $84 million for the year. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.904 billion, or 8.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. These increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense, as previously discussed. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, compensation and benefits expense increased 5.1% for the year. Stock based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $49 million, or 8.0% in 2006, due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of 2005, the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of 2006, and the impact of adopting the non substantive vesting period approach of FAS 123R (discussed further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our Management Incentive Awards program in 2006. 29 Other operating expenses increased by $2.570 billion, or 18.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in 2005 on the increase in operating expenses by category in 2006. Total %Increase AcquisitionImpact % IncreasewithoutAcquisitions Other Operating Expenses: Repairs and maintenance 5.3 % 3.0 % 2.3 % Depreciation and amortization 6.3 % 3.1 % 3.2 % Purchased transportation 34.9 % 4.8 % 30.1 % Fuel 27.3 % 7.1 % 20.2 % Other occupancy 7.6 % 4.2 % 3.4 % Other expenses 8.5 % 3.9 % 4.6 % 18.5 % 4.5 % 14.0 % Excluding the effect of acquisitions, the 20.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet A, diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. The 30.1% increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our International Package business, currency fluctuations, higher fuel prices, increased rail costs, and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously. The 2.3% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs. The 3.2% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment, aircraft and engines, and higher amortization expense on intangible assets. The 3.4% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses. The increase in other expenses was impacted by several items, including the $87 million tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see Contingencies section below). Investment Income and Interest Expense 2007 compared to 2006 The increase in investment income of $13 million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest earning investments and increased equity method losses on investment partnerships. Interest expense increased $35 million in 2007, primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding, largely related to commercial paper. Our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of 2007, causing a corresponding increase in interest expense, as a result of the payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund. Increased interest charges were somewhat offset, however, by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects, including aircraft purchases and our Worldport expansion. 2006 compared to 2005 The decrease in investment income of $18 million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments, due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings, business acquisitions, and capital expenditures. This was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments, as well as the absence of any investment impairments during 2006 ($16 million of investment impairments were recognized in 2005, as described below). The $39 million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships. This was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during 2006, as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year. 30 Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2007 compared to 2006 Net income for 2007 was $382 million, an 90.9% decrease from the $4.202 billion achieved in 2006, resulting in an 90.7% decrease in diluted earnings per share to $0.36 in 2007 from $3.86 in 2006. This decrease in net income was largely due to the after tax $3.772 billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund. Additionally, 2007 net income was adversely impacted by $31 million as a result of the restructuring charge in our France Supply Chain & Freight business, $141 million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge, and $43 million as a result of the SVSO charge. These items were partially offset by the improved results in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments. The reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal, aircraft impairment, France restructuring, and SVSO charges noted above. These items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $3.77 and $3.75 in 2007. Basic and diluted earnings per share benefited from a reduction in outstanding shares in 2007 compared with 2006, due to our ongoing share repurchase program. 2006 compared to 2005 Net income for 2006 was $4.202 billion, an 8.6% increase from the $3.870 billion achieved in 2005, resulting in a 11.2% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.86 in 2006 from $3.47 in 2005. Net income in 2006 benefited from a $52 million reduction in income tax expense ($0.05 impact to diluted earnings per share) due to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non U.S. operations. Diluted earnings per share has increased at a faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program. The increase in net income for 2006 was largely due to higher operating profits for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.123, $5.589, and $5.793 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 operating cash flows compared with 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to the $6.100 billion payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund in 2007. This was partially offset by reduced 2007 fundings to our management pension and postretirement benefit plans. In 2007, we funded $687 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to $1.625 billion in 2006 and $995 million in 2005. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2008 are projected to be approximately $133 million. The amount of U.S. federal estimated income tax payments was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005, due to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment for income tax purposes. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2008, we received an $850 million U.S. federal tax refund due to 2007 overpayments of our estimated tax liability. In 2005, we received a $374 million tax refund associated with the 1985 1990 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reached previously, primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance. Additionally, we paid approximately $35 million in 2007 to employees who accepted the SVSO offer, and we expect to pay approximately $28 million in the first quarter of 2008 related to this program. On November 9, 2007, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on December 31, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and 31 an increase of $0.10 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years rate increases. Additionally, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and U.S. origin international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. In January 2008, UPS Freight announced a general rate increase averaging 5.4 percent covering non contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The increase goes into effect on February 4, 2008, and applies to minimum charge, LTL and TL rates. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $2.199 billion, $2.340 billion, and $975 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The decrease in cash used in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and increased net sales of marketable securities and short term investments. Net sales of marketable securities and short term investments were $621 million, $482 million, and $2.752 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, as well as complete business acquisitions. In 2005, we spent $1.488 billion on business acquisitions, primarily Overnite Corp., Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). We had a net cash use of $39 million in 2007, compared with cash generation of $68 and $95 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to originations, sales, and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our commercial lending, asset based lending, and leasing portfolios. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash, which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we recognized the gains associated with these hedges as a reduction of fuel expense over the original term of the hedges through 2007. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Buildings and facilities $ 853 $ 720 $ 495 Aircraft and parts 1,137 1,150 874 Vehicles 492 831 456 Information technology 338 384 362 $ 2,820 $ 3,085 $ 2,187 As described in the Commitments section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $2.297, ($3.851), and ($4.175) billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we increased our commercial paper borrowings to $7.366 billion, an increase of $6.575 billion over December 31, 2006. This issuance of commercial paper was used to fund the withdrawal payment to the Central States Pension Fund upon ratification of our labor contract with the Teamsters, as previously discussed. The commercial paper balance was reduced subsequent to December 31, 2007 as a result of an issuance of long term debt (discussed further in the Sources of Credit section) and the receipt of an income tax refund. 32 Issuances of debt during 2007 consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper and UPS Notes. Repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equity method partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt. Our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long term debt. In October 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion, which replaced the remaining amount available under our February 2007 share repurchase authorization. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we repurchased a total of 35.9, 32.6, and 33.9 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.618 , $2.455, and $2.479 billion, respectively ($2.639, $2.460, and $2.479 billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements). In January 2008, we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value. Prospectively, we intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately 50% 60% funds from operations to total debt. To implement this policy, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $10.0 billion. We intend to complete this level of share repurchases within two years. Share repurchases may take the form of an accelerated share repurchase program, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.42 per share in 2007 from $0.38 per share in 2006, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.703 billion from $1.577 billion. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. On January 31, 2008, our Board declared a dividend of $0.45 per share, which is payable on March 4, 2008 to shareowners of record on February 11, 2008. The Board also approved an earlier payment schedule for the dividend typically declared in November. Beginning in 2008 and going forward, that dividend is expected to be paid in December instead of the following January. The movement of the fourth quarter dividend payment into December will result in a total of five dividend payments being made in 2008. Sources of Credit We are authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our U.S. commercial paper program. We had $7.366 billion outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2007, with an average interest rate of 4.36%. At December 31, 2007, we classified $4.0 billion of our commercial paper as long term debt on our balance sheet, due to the subsequent refunding of the commercial paper through the issuance of long term debt, as discussed further below. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to 1.0 billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2007. In November 2007, we filed a shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. On January 15, 2008, we completed an offering of $1.750 billion of 4.50% senior notes due January 2013, $750 million of 5.50% senior notes due January 2018, and $1.500 billion of 6.20% senior notes due January 2038. All of these notes pay interest semiannually, and allow for redemption of the notes by UPS at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a make whole amount, plus accrued interest. After pricing and underwriting discounts, we received a total of $3.961 billion in cash proceeds from the offering. The proceeds from the offering were used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. We maintain three credit agreements with a consortium of banks, two of which provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring April 17, 2008 and the other April 19, 2012, and the third 33 providing a revolving credit facility of $7.0 billion and expiring on October 17, 2008. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. Covenants in our credit facilities generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the company. The notes issued in January 2008 include limitations on secured indebtedness and on sale leaseback transactions. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all applicable covenant tests were satisfied as of December 31, 2007. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in millions): Year CapitalLeases OperatingLeases DebtPrincipal DebtInterest PurchaseCommitments PensionFundings OtherLiabilities 2008 $ 108 $ 378 $ 3,426 $ 329 $ 1,306 $ 101 $ 78 2009 73 325 83 384 791 824 74 2010 91 237 40 380 729 630 71 2011 31 166 33 379 698 717 69 2012 31 116 26 377 304 859 67 After 2012 285 560 6,919 6,177 334 203 Total $ 619 $ 1,782 $ 10,527 $ 8,026 $ 3,828 $ 3,465 $ 562 Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. Capital leases, operating leases, and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2007. The calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. The maturities of debt principal and interest include the effect of the January 2008 issuance of $4.0 billion in senior notes that were used to reduce the commercial paper balance. Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. In February 2007, we announced an order for 27 Boeing 767 300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012. We also have firm commitments to purchase nine Boeing 747 400F aircraft scheduled for delivery between 2008 and 2010, and two Boeing 747 400BCF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. In July 2007, we formally cancelled our previous order for ten Airbus A380 800 freighter aircraft, pursuant to the provisions of an agreement signed with Airbus in February 2007. As a result of our cancellation of the Airbus A380 800 order, we received cash in July 2007 representing the return of amounts previously paid to Airbus as purchase contract deposits and accrued interest on those balances. Additionally, we received a credit memorandum to be used by UPS for the purchase of parts and services from Airbus. The cancellation of the Airbus order did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 34 Pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the UPS IBT Pension Plan, which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the Teamsters. The UPS IBT Pension Plan is the only UPS sponsored pension or postretirement benefit plan with a material minimum funding requirement as of December 31, 2007. The pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, using discount rates, asset returns, and other assumptions appropriate for this plan. To the extent that the funded status of the UPS IBT pension plan in future years differs from our current projections, the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above. The contractual payments due under the other liabilities column primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The table above does not include approximately $355 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. In addition, although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities. FIN 48 is discussed further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.177 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. As of December 31, 2007, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $860 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full time supervisors. In August 2005, the court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims, and plaintiff appealed the ruling. In October 2007, the appeals court reversed the lower courts ruling. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In another case, Cornn v. UPS, which was certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and or overtime and meal and rest periods. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately 23,600 drivers and seek back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys fees. UPS settled this matter in full for a total payment of $87 million in the second quarter of 2007. The settlement had no impact on our 2007 operating results as it was accrued for previously during the third quarter of 2006. In another case, Hohider v. UPS, which in July 2007 was certified as a class action in a Pennsylvania federal court, plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the Companys interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35,000 current and former employees, and seek backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys fees. In August 2007, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Companys Petition to hear the appeal of the trial courts recent certification order. The appeal will likely take one year. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 35 UPS and Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate Mail Boxes Etc. centers and The UPS Store locations. These lawsuits relate to the re branding of Mail Boxes Etc. centers to The UPS Store, the The UPS Store business model, the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of The UPS Store franchises, and UPSs sale of services in the franchisees territories. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. UPS and UPS Freight, along with several other companies involved in the LTL freight business, have been named as defendants in numerous putative class action lawsuits filed since July 30, 2007 in courts across the nation. The cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a Multi District Litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates, and they seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys fees. We intend to defend against these suits vigorously. These cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Along with an income tax audit for years 2003 and 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently examining non income based taxes including excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases, which could lead to proposed assessments. The IRS has not presented an official position with regard to excise taxes at this time, and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment; however, we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 246,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. In September 2007, we reached a new national master agreement with the Teamsters, which was ratified in December 2007. The new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans, and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement will take effect on August 1, 2008, with the exception of our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. We have approximately 2,900 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1, 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 on October 2, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (approximately 2,900). These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Apart from the Central States Pension Fund, we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans. Other Matters We received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the DOJs investigations into air cargo pricing practices in July 2006 and into freight forwarding 36 pricing practices in December 2007. In October 2007, we received information requests from the European Commission and the New Zealand Commerce Commission relating to investigations of freight forwarding pricing practices. We are cooperating with these investigations. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. Additionally, we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was an asset (liability) of $(179) and $10 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $42 and $8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through the end of 2007. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of $(42) and $30 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for 37 such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $387 and $183 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2007 and 2007 would be approximately $100 and $29 million, respectively. We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would be approximately $15 and $12 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of such investments was $35 and $80 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $4 and $8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. 38 New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which was issued to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of FAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities, and removed certain leasing transactions from its scope. We adopted FAS 157 on January 1, 2008, and the impact of adoption was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)) (FAS 158). This statement requires us to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet, and required delayed recognition items, consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, which resulted in a reduction to AOCI of $2.097 billion and a reduction of long term deferred tax liabilities of $1.258 billion. Additionally, we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under Statement No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions, and we measure the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we will be required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008. As a result of this change in measurement date, we recorded a cumulative effect after tax $44 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159), which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an instrument by instrument basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates, such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally, SFAS No. 159 allows for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption, with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. We adopted FAS 159 on January 1, 2008, and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, we recorded an after tax $12 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008, representing the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting FAS 159. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 requires that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, and the impact of this Interpretation is discussed in Note 13. In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. EITF 06 11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital. EITF 06 11 is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and we will adopt the provisions of EITF 06 11 beginning in the first quarter of 2008. EITF 06 11 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2007 the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired 39 and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of FAS No. 141R on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity (as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity) and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $13 million in noncontrolling interests classified in other non current liabilities. FAS 160 applies prospectively as of January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Companys financial position as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2007, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill Impairment We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. 40 We use a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the fair value of our goodwill. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2007, our recorded goodwill was $2.577 billion, of which $2.282 billion relates to our Supply Chain and Freight segment. This segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years, largely due to the acquisitions that we have made. Because of its growth, this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies, resulting in higher volatility in our DCF model projections than for our other segments. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2007, 2006 and 2005 resulted in no goodwill impairment. Self Insurance Accruals We self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends. Differences in actual 41 experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Companys costs and obligations for the year 2007 (in millions): 25 Basis PointIncrease 25 Basis PointDecrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (65 ) $ 67 Effect on projected benefit obligation (615 ) 643 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (36 ) 36 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (6 ) 6 Effect on projected benefit obligation (88 ) 91 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 2 (2 ) Effect on projected benefit obligation 19 (19 ) Financial Instruments As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 15 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the Market Risk section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over the counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the Market Risk section of this report. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets As of December 31, 2007, we had $17.663 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144), we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that 42 would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation, we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. This charge is included in the caption Other expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income, of which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment. During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In the first quarter of 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48), and related guidance (see Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements). As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 43 Forward Looking Statements Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words believes, expects, anticipates, we see, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements: The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business. The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. 44 Item 7A.
