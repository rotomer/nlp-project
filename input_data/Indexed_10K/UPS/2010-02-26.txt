Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our U.S. Domestic Package, International Package, and Supply Chain & Freight segments were all negatively affected by the deteriorating worldwide economic situation in 2008 and 2009. Declines in world trade, U.S. industrial production and retail sales particularly affected our package delivery, LTL and forwarding operations. Our consolidated results are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 / 2008 2008 / 2007 Revenue (in millions) $ 45,297 $ 51,486 $ 49,692 (12.0 )% 3.6 % Operating Expenses (in millions) 41,496 46,104 49,114 (10.0 )% (6.1 )% Operating Profit (in millions) $ 3,801 $ 5,382 $ 578 (29.4 )% N/A Operating Margin 8.4 % 10.5 % 1.2 % Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands) 15,064 15,539 15,750 (3.1 )% (1.3 )% Average Revenue Per Piece $ 9.83 $ 10.70 $ 10.24 (8.1 )% 4.5 % Net Income (in millions) $ 2,152 $ 3,003 $ 382 (28.3 )% N/A Basic Earnings Per Share $ 2.16 $ 2.96 $ 0.36 (27.0 )% N/A Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 2.14 $ 2.94 $ 0.36 (27.2 )% N/A Volume and revenue trends began to improve in the latter half of 2009. Additionally, cost containment initiatives and better network efficiencies resulted in improving operating profit trends for our small package operations. Items Affecting Comparability The year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items (amounts in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Operating Expenses: Aircraft Impairment Charges $ 181 $ $ 221 Goodwill Impairment Charge 548 Intangible Impairment Charge 27 SVSO Charge 68 Pension Plan Withdrawal Charge 6,100 France Restructuring Charges 46 Interest Expense: Currency Remeasurement Charge 77 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) from the Items Above (94 ) (2,448 ) Aircraft Impairment Charges In the first quarter of 2009, we completed an impairment assessment of our McDonnell Douglas DC 8 aircraft fleet, and recorded an impairment charge of $181 million, which affected our U.S. Domestic Package segment. In the first quarter of 2007, we completed an impairment assessment of our Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft fleets, and recognized an impairment charge of $221 million, of which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment. These charges, as well as our accounting policies pertaining to long lived assets, are discussed further in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 23 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment Charge In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our UPS Freight reporting unit, which was formed through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million. This charge, as well as our accounting policies pertaining to goodwill, is discussed further in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Intangible Impairment Charge In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed an impairment assessment on a customer list intangible asset related to our domestic package entity in the United Kingdom. We recorded a $27 million charge related to this assessment, which is further discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Special Voluntary Separation Opportunity (SVSO) Charge In December 2006, we offered the SVSO to approximately 640 employees who worked in non operating functions. This program was established to improve the efficiency of non operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company. The SVSO ended in February 2007, and 195, or 30% of eligible employees, accepted the offer. As a result, we recorded a charge to expense of approximately $68 million in the first quarter of 2007, to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the SVSO program. Pension Plan Withdrawal Charge Our national master agreement with the Teamsters allowed us, upon ratification, to withdraw employees from the Central States Pension Fund and to establish a jointly trusteed single employer plan for this group (UPS IBT Pension Plan). Upon ratification of the contract in December 2007 and our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, we recorded a $6.1 billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability, and made a December 2007 payment in the same amount to the Central States Pension Fund to satisfy this liability. The withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the Central States Pension Fund, in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). We negotiated our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund as part of our national master agreement with the Teamsters, which included other modifications to hourly wage rates, healthcare and pension benefits, and work rules. We sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges, and would present a risk to UPS of having to face higher future contribution requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those UPS employees who participated in the fund. We believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement seven months before the expiration of the previous agreement, as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to UPS Teamster employees through the new UPS IBT Pension Plan. As the UPS IBT Pension Plan matures, we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the Central States Pension Fund. France Restructuring Charge In the third quarter of 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in France. The objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the Europe region. The restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program, which was ratified by our companys trade union representatives in France in July 2007. Employees participating in this program were entitled to severance benefits, including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase. These severance benefits were formula driven and were in accordance with French statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements. We recorded a restructuring charge of $46 million in 2007 related to this program. 24 Table of Contents Currency Remeasurement Charge During the second quarter of 2009, we incurred a $77 million non cash, pre tax currency remeasurement charge on certain foreign currency denominated obligations. Results of Operations Segment Review The results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments. We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non GAAP financial measures, including operating profit, operating margin, pre tax income, net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non comparable items discussed previously. We believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. We believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.

Our air product volume was stronger than our ground volume, as our air volume benefited from market share gains resulting from the recent departure of a competitor in the U.S. market, as well as improving economic trends in the latter half of the year. The growth in air volume was strongest in our less time sensitive products, such as Next Day Air Saver and Three Day Select. 25 Table of Contents Volume trends improved in the fourth quarter, largely as a result of overall economic improvements, as average daily volume for Next Day Air and Deferred products increased 2.8% and 4.3%, respectively, over 2008 levels. Ground volume demonstrated an improving trend over the previous quarters despite a 2.9% decline in the fourth quarter compared with 2008. 2008 compared to 2007 U.S. Domestic ground and air volume declined primarily as a result of the recession in the U.S. economy. Relatively high energy costs during most of 2008, combined with the deepening recession and weak output within the industrial production and retail sales sectors, adversely affected the small package market, which placed additional pressure on our domestic package volume. These declining volume trends worsened through the year with Next Day Air, Deferred, and Ground volume declining 8.6%, 3.5%, and 2.1%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Revenue Per Piece 2009 compared to 2008 Revenue per piece for our air products was negatively affected in 2009 by a decline in the fuel surcharge rate for air products. Additionally, the revenue per piece decline for our air products was impacted by lower average package weights and a mix shift toward lower yielding products, reflecting the economic recession in the United States. The decline in revenue per piece for our ground products was primarily due to a decrease in the fuel surcharge rate, but was also impacted by lower average package weights. The factors decreasing revenue per piece for our ground and air products were partially offset by an increase in base rates that took effect on January 5, 2009. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 5.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. These rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis. The trend towards lower package weights began to stabilize in the fourth quarter, however product mix within our air and ground services continued to adversely impact revenue per piece, as the lower yielding products within those categories represented a larger share of our overall package volume. 2008 compared to 2007 Revenue per piece for our air products increased primarily due to a base rate increase and a higher fuel surcharge rate for air products. This increase was adversely impacted by lower average package weights, a mix shift toward lower yielding products, and hedging losses. Revenue per piece for our ground products increased primarily due to the base rate increase, as well as a higher fuel surcharge rate. A base rate increase became effective on December 31, 2007, which increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. 26 Table of Contents Fuel Surcharges UPS applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Energy Departments Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Energy Departments On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows: Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 / 2008 2008 / 2007 Next Day Air / Deferred 4.0 % 25.2 % 12.2 % (21.2 )% 13.0 % Ground 3.3 % 8.0 % 4.3 % (4.7 ) 3.7 % On January 5, 2009 and December 31, 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The 2009 decrease and 2008 increase in the air and ground fuel surcharges are due to the significant variations in jet and diesel fuel prices (in addition to the reduction in the index on the air surcharge). Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue, net of the impact of hedging, decreased by $1.924 billion in 2009, primarily due to the lower fuel surcharge rates discussed above, as well as the decline in volume for our air and ground products. In 2008, fuel surcharge revenue, net of the impact of hedging losses, increased by $1.119 billion, primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates but partially offset by the decline in volume for our air and ground products. Operating Profit and Margin 2009 compared to 2008 Operating profit in 2009 was adversely impacted by the U.S. economic recession, decreased network efficiencies due to the decline in volume, changes in package characteristics, and a shift in product mix away from our premium services. Operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense. We adjusted our air and ground networks to better match these lower volume levels, as well as reduced labor hours and employee headcount, resulting in cost savings. Operating profit trends improved during the fourth quarter of 2009 due to both improving volume trends and the positive impact of continued cost and production efficiencies, which combined to improve the operating margin to 10.1% for the quarter. 2008 compared to 2007 Operating profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by the U.S. recession, lower asset utilization due to the decline in volume, lower average package weights, and a shift in product mix away from our premium services, partially offset by the increase in the fuel surcharge relative to the cost of fuel. Because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of 2008, operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments. Because of this time lag, fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008, which is the opposite effect the company experienced in 2007, when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted. 27 Table of Contents International Package Operations Year Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 / 2008 2008 / 2007 Revenue (in millions): Domestic $ 2,111 $ 2,344 $ 2,177 (9.9 )% 7.7 % Export 7,176 8,294 7,488 (13.5 ) 10.8 Cargo 412 655 616 (37.1 ) 6.3 Total Revenue $ 9,699 $ 11,293 $ 10,281 (14.1 ) 9.8 Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands): Domestic 1,218 1,150 1,132 5.9 % 1.6 % Export 796 813 761 (2.1 ) 6.8 Total Avg.

Volume 2009 compared to 2008 Export volume declined, primarily due to weakness in the Asia, Europe and U.S. export lanes, as the worldwide economic recession and slowdown in world trade more than offset market share gains. Transborder export volume was relatively stronger within the European Union and North America trade areas, while volume in the longer export trade lanes was comparatively weaker. Non U.S. domestic volume increased for the year, largely due to the acquisition of Unsped Paket Servisi San ve Ticaret A.S. (Unsped) in Turkey, as well as volume growth in Germany, France, Poland and Canada. By the fourth quarter of 2009, export volume began to improve as global trade and economic activity accelerated. The Asia and U.S. export lanes demonstrated significant improvement, as those trade areas suffered a relatively greater decline in the early part of the year. Domestic volume continued to benefit from the Unsped acquisition, as well as market share gains and general economic improvement in Europe and the Americas. Volume was relatively stronger in the small and middle market customer segments. 2008 compared to 2007 Export volume increased in each region throughout the world in 2008, however volume began to slow in the latter half of 2008 due to difficult worldwide economic conditions. Intra regional volume continued to experience solid growth, especially in Europe. Asian export volume continued to benefit from our geographic 28 Table of Contents service expansion, including the connection of several cities to our new air hub in Shanghai, China. Export volume growth was negatively impacted by declines in shipments to the U.S. from other regions in the world, due to the slowing U.S. economy. Export volume trends weakened in the latter half of the year, due to the severe global economic slowdown, with fourth quarter export volume increasing at a much slower rate than what has been experienced over the last several years. Non U.S. domestic volume increased, and was impacted by volume growth in our domestic businesses in the Euro zone and Canada, but negatively affected by the weak economic conditions in the United Kingdom. Revenue Per Piece 2009 compared to 2008 Export revenue per piece decreased, largely due to the adverse impact of currency exchange rates, lower fuel surcharge rates, and product mix, but was partially offset by base rate increases that took effect in the first quarter of 2009. Currency adjusted export revenue per piece declined 10.1% for 2009. Export revenue per piece was impacted by the lower revenue per piece transborder products comprising a relatively larger portion of our total volume, as we experienced larger volume declines on some of our longer export trade lanes with higher yields. Domestic revenue per piece decreased, which was primarily caused by adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations (currency adjusted domestic revenue per piece declined 7.2% for the year), as well as the impact of lower fuel surcharge rates. Total average revenue per piece decreased 12.1% for the year on a currency adjusted basis. On January 5, 2009, we increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market. Export revenue per piece showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter, as higher yielding trade lanes, such as Asia to Europe and Asia to North America, comprised a larger proportion of our total export volume. Revenue per piece in the fourth quarter benefited from a weaker U.S. Dollar, but continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge rates. 2008 compared to 2007 Export revenue per piece increased, largely due to base rate increases, higher fuel surcharge rates, and favorable currency exchange rates, but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products and a shift away from our premium services. Domestic revenue per piece increased, and was affected by rate increases, higher fuel surcharge rates, and favorable exchange rates. Total average revenue per piece increased 2.7% on a currency adjusted basis. On December 31, 2007, we increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Total revenue per piece declined 8.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar (currency adjusted revenue per piece declined 3.0%), but was also impacted by an acceleration in the shift away from our premium services and lower package weights. Fuel Surcharges On January 5, 2009 and December 31, 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S. related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The fuel surcharges for products originating outside the United States continue to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue 29 Table of Contents decreased by $788 million in 2009, due to lower fuel surcharge rates caused by decreased fuel prices as well as a decrease in international air volume. Fuel surcharge revenue increased by $586 million in 2008, due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices, as well as an increase in international air volume. Operating Profit and Margin 2009 compared to 2008 The decline in operating profit for the year was caused primarily by a shift in product mix away from our premium services, and volume declines in some of the longer export trade lanes. Operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense. To reduce costs, we adjusted our air network and reduced block hours and flight segments in certain international regions. The volume trends began to improve later in the year, and in the fourth quarter operating profit increased 19% (excluding an impairment charge in 2008), as the impact of cost initiatives and network improvements drove an improvement in the operating margin to 16.7%. 2008 compared to 2007 The decline in operating profit and operating margin were affected by reduced asset utilization resulting from changes in economic conditions and trade flows, such as the reduced import volume into the United States. Operating profit and margin were also negatively affected by a shift in product mix away from our premium services, as well as expenses associated with integration activities in our delivery network. Because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of 2008, operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments. As a result of this time lag, fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008, which is the opposite effect the company experienced in 2007, when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted.

Forwarding revenue declined in all major transportation modes, including domestic and international air freight and ocean freight, and was impacted by lower volumes, lower fuel surcharges, and lower security and other accessorial charges. Logistics distribution and post sales service revenue also declined, primarily resulting from the weak global economy, however mail services revenue increased for the year. Freight revenue declined, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge rates and a decline in average daily LTL shipments. Total LTL weight per shipment declined for the year, reflecting the weak LTL market and the ongoing economic recession in the United States in 2009. Average LTL shipments per day also declined, as market share gains were more than offset by the impact of the weak economy. LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased, primarily as a result of the lower fuel surcharge rates, as total fuel surcharge revenue declined $188 million for the year primarily resulting from lower diesel fuel prices. However, this decline was partially offset by an increase in base prices that took effect on January 5, 2009, as UPS Freight increased minimum charge, LTL and TL rates an average of 5.9%, covering non contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business, experienced a decline in revenue, primarily caused by lower interest rates and decreased loan volume in our financial business. Revenue trends for our forwarding, logistics, and LTL products improved in the fourth quarter of 2009, largely resulting from favorable comparisons with the prior year. The change in revenue for our forwarding and logistics businesses benefited from the weaker U.S. Dollar during the quarter, while revenue in the forwarding and LTL units continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue. 2008 compared to 2007 Forwarding and logistics revenue increased, primarily due to growth in international air freight, North American air freight, distribution services and mail services. Revenue growth in this business was affected by fuel and security surcharges, expanded air freight service offerings, overall market growth and improved customer retention rates. Growth was negatively impacted by weakness in the ocean freight business. Freight increased revenue for the year, as a result of improved yields and higher fuel surcharge rates, but partially offset by a decline in average daily LTL shipments. Average LTL shipments per day decreased, reflecting the weak LTL market in the United States in 2008 as compared with 2007. However, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased, due to an increase in base rates in 2008 and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher diesel fuel prices. On February 4, 2008, UPS Freight increased minimum charge, LTL and TL rates by an average of 5.4% covering non contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight increased revenue, largely due to our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service. Revenue declined by $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, as difficult worldwide economic conditions, slowing world trade, and unfavorable currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted the forwarding and logistics businesses. The strengthening U.S. Dollar resulted in a $58 million negative impact to the change in revenue in the fourth quarter. 31 Table of Contents Operating Profit and Margin 2009 compared to 2008 The lower operating profit in the forwarding unit was impacted by the weak global demand for forwarding services, as well as capacity reductions by outside ocean and air freight carriers. During the latter half of 2009 and particularly in the fourth quarter, capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers, resulting in a negative impact to operating profit and margin. The operating profit for our logistics unit declined slightly, and was impacted by the loss incurred on the sale of some non core European logistics operations. However, the operating margin in this business remained stable, as costs were reduced commensurate with the decline in revenues. Our UPS Freight unit reported improved profitability for 2009, due to a reduction in vacation accruals resulting from modifications in vacation policies and changes in the workforce coverage of our individual plans. Excluding this reduction in vacation liabilities, the UPS Freight unit reported a small operating loss due to the economic recession and difficult LTL market in the United States. The combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased during the year. The increase was primarily driven by a gain on sale of substantially all of our international Mail Boxes Etc operations during the second quarter. 2008 compared to 2007 Operating profit improved in the forwarding and logistics businesses, primarily resulting from revenue management initiatives and a focus on asset utilization. Operating profit was lower at UPS Freight during the year, largely as a result of the slowing LTL market in the United States. The overall segment operating margin improved, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, due to the improved margins in the forwarding and logistics businesses. Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 / 2008 2008 / 2007 Operating Expenses (in millions): Compensation and Benefits $ 25,640 $ 26,063 $ 31,745 (1.6 )% (17.9 )% Impact of Pension Plan Withdrawal Charge (6,100 ) Impact of SVSO Charge (68 ) Impact of France Restructuring Charge (46 ) Adjusted Compensation and Benefits 25,640 26,063 25,531 (1.6 )% 2.1 % Repairs and Maintenance 1,075 1,194 1,157 (10.0 )% 3.2 % Depreciation and Amortization 1,747 1,814 1,745 (3.7 )% 4.0 % Purchased Transportation 5,379 6,550 5,902 (17.9 )% 11.0 % Fuel 2,365 4,134 2,974 (42.8 )% 39.0 % Other Occupancy 985 1,027 958 (4.1 )% 7.2 % Other Expenses 4,305 5,322 4,633 (19.1 )% 14.9 % Impact of Aircraft Impairment Charges (181 ) (221 ) Impact of Goodwill and Intangible Impairment Charges (575 ) Adjusted Other Expenses 4,124 4,747 4,412 (13.1 )% 7.6 % Total Operating Expenses $ 41,496 $ 46,104 $ 49,114 (10.0 )% (6.1 )% Adjusted Total Operating Expenses 41,315 45,529 42,679 (9.3 )% 6.7 % Currency Translation (Benefit) Cost $ (390 ) $ 342 32 Table of Contents Compensation and Benefits The decrease in compensation and benefits expense during 2009 compared with 2008 was impacted by several items. A large component of this decrease was related to employee payroll costs, as union labor hours declined as a result of lower U.S. Domestic Package volume, and management payroll declined as a result of a reduction in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with a wage freeze. Benefits expense increased due to higher employee health and welfare program costs, which were impacted by higher union contribution rates, and increased pension expense. Pension expense increases resulted from higher union contribution rates for multi employer pension plans, combined with increased interest costs, a decrease in our expected return on plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses for company sponsored plans. The interest cost grew due to continued service accruals, while the decrease in expected return on plan assets and the actuarial losses were primarily due to the negative asset returns experienced in 2008. The overall increase in benefits expense was partially offset by a freeze in the company contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan. Compensation and benefits expense increased in 2008 compared with 2007, excluding charges for the multi employer pension plan withdrawal, the SVSO and the France restructuring. Increased benefit expenses were largely due to higher employee health and welfare program costs, which was impacted by medical cost inflation. Employee payroll costs increased due to contractual wage increases for our union employees and normal merit increases for our non union employees. Repairs and Maintenance Repairs and maintenance expense declined in 2009, largely due to reduced vehicle maintenance expenses resulting from a reduction in miles driven. The 2008 increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased aircraft maintenance, somewhat offset by reduced vehicle maintenance expense. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2009, primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense on equipment and facilities, as certain Worldport assets became fully depreciated, as well as lower software amortization resulting from fewer new capitalized software projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles, resulting from new deliveries in 2008 and 2009. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2008 resulted primarily from higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles due to new deliveries, but was partially offset by reduced amortization expense on capitalized software resulting from a decrease in software development projects. Purchased Transportation The decrease in purchased transportation in 2009 was driven by a combination of lower volume in our international package and forwarding businesses, a stronger U.S. Dollar, and decreased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third party carriers as a result of lower fuel prices. The increase in purchased transportation in 2008 was attributable to a combination of higher volume in our international package and forwarding businesses, a weaker U.S. Dollar, and increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third party carriers resulting from higher fuel prices. Fuel The decrease in fuel expense in 2009 was impacted by significantly lower prices for jet A fuel, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, as well as lower usage of these products in our operations. The increase in fuel expense in 2008 resulted from higher prices for jet A fuel, diesel, and unleaded gasoline as well as lower hedging gains. 33 Table of Contents Other Occupancy The decrease in other occupancy expense in 2009 was primarily caused by lower electricity and natural gas costs, as well as lower rent expense. The 2008 increase in other occupancy expense resulted from higher rent, property tax, electricity and natural gas expense. The changes in both years were significantly impacted by changes in energy commodity prices. Other Expenses The decline in other expenses in 2009, exclusive of impairment charges, was due in part to certain variable costs that declined as a result of lower package volume, such as the expense associated with customer claims for lost or damaged packages, rent expense for transportation equipment, cargo handling costs, and aircraft landing fees. Additionally, certain other costs declined primarily as a result of cost containment programs, such as employee expense reimbursements, office supplies, professional services, and advertising costs. The increase in other expenses in 2008, exclusive of impairment charges, was attributable to increased expenses for leased transportation equipment, data processing, advertising, professional services, and bad debts. Investment Income and Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 / 2008 2008 / 2007 Investment Income and Interest Expense (in millions): Investment Income $ 10 $ 75 $ 99 (86.7 )% (24.2 )% Interest Expense $ (445 ) $ (442 ) $ (246 ) 0.7 % 79.7 % Impact of Currency Remeasurement Charge 77 Adjusted Interest Expense (368 ) (442 ) (246 ) (16.7 )% 79.7 % Investment Income The 2009 decline was largely due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments, a significantly lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the United States, and a loss on the fair value adjustments of certain investment partnerships. The 2008 decline was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments, a lower yield earned on our investments, and impairment losses. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded impairment losses on certain perpetual preferred securities, and an auction rate security collateralized by preferred securities, issued by large financial institutions. The impairment charge resulted from conversion offers from the issuers of these securities at prices well below the stated redemption value of the preferred shares. These securities, which had a cost basis of $42 million, were written down to their fair value of $25 million as of June 30, 2009, resulting in an other than temporary impairment of $17 million. During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The impairment resulted from actions by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to place FNMA and FHLMC under conservatorship. Additionally, we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on holdings of several medium term notes issued by Lehman Brothers Inc., which declared bankruptcy during the third quarter of 2008. The total of these credit related impairment losses was $23 million. Interest Expense Excluding the currency remeasurement charge, the 2009 decrease in interest expense was largely due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps. 34 Table of Contents The 2008 increase in interest expense was largely due to a higher average balance of outstanding debt. In early 2008, we completed the issuance of $4.0 billion in long term debt, the proceeds of which were used to reduce our commercial paper balance. Our commercial paper balances had previously increased to fund the $6.1 billion Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment in December 2007. The impact of increased debt balances was partially mitigated, however, by lower average rates incurred on our variable rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the United States throughout 2008. Income Tax Expense Year Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 / 2008 2008 / 2007 Income Tax Expense $ 1,214 $ 2,012 $ 49 (39.7 )% N/A Effective Tax Rate 36.1 % 40.1 % 11.4 % 2009 compared to 2008 Income tax expense declined primarily due to lower pre tax income. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges described previously, which were not deductible for tax purposes and resulted in the effective tax rate increasing by 4.1%. 2008 compared to 2007 Income tax expense increased primarily due to higher pre tax income. Pre tax income in 2007 was adversely impacted by the Central States withdrawal charge, as noted previously. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to several factors resulting from the Central States withdrawal charge in 2007. These factors included having proportionally lower tax credits in 2008, and the effect of having a much higher proportion of our taxable income in 2008 being subject to tax in the United States, whereas a relatively greater proportion of taxable income in 2007 was subject to tax outside the United States, where effective tax rates are generally lower. The effective tax rate in 2008 was also 4.1% higher due to the lack of tax deductibility of the goodwill and intangible impairment charges discussed previously. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2007 to 2009 time period, however in 2007 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund, as previously discussed. In 2009, operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the decline in profitability for our three reporting segments. However, the impact of this decline was partially offset by reduced working capital needs. Most of the remaining variability in our operating cash flows was primarily due to changes in pension contributions and the timing of income tax payments. The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our operating cash flows (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 2,152 $ 3,003 $ 382 Non cash operating activities(a) 3,863 4,539 2,989 Pension and postretirement plan contributions (UPS sponsored plans) (924 ) (246 ) (687 ) Income tax receivables and payables 245 1,167 (1,267 ) Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities (137 ) (6 ) (180 ) Other operating activities 86 (31 ) (114 ) Net cash from operating activities $ 5,285 $ 8,426 $ 1,123 35 Table of Contents (a) Represents depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign exchange, deferred income taxes, provisions for uncollectible accounts, pension and postretirement benefit expense, stock compensation expense, impairment charges, and other non cash items. Contributions to our company sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans. The increase in contributions in 2009 was largely due to minimum funding requirements related to the UPS IBT Pension Plan. As discussed further in the Contractual Commitments section, we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years, primarily related to the UPS IBT Pension Plan. During the 2007 to 2009 period, we made no significant discretionary contributions to our plans. The Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment was made in December 2007, and significantly impacted operating cash flow. The payment was deductible for U.S. Federal and state income tax purposes, and we therefore received cash tax benefits in the form of refunds or lower estimated payments during 2008 and 2007. The impact of the Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment on our cash flow from operations was as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Impact of Central States Pension Fund Withdrawal Payment: Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment $ $ $ (6,100 ) Cash income tax benefits from withdrawal payment 1,228 1,100 Impact of the Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment and associated taxes on cash flow from operations $ $ 1,228 $ (5,000 ) Investing Activities Our primary uses of cash flows for investing activities were for capital expenditures, as follows (amounts in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net cash used in investing activities $ 1,248 $ 3,179 $ 2,199 Capital Expenditures: Buildings and facilities $ 568 $ 968 $ 853 Aircraft and parts 611 852 1,137 Vehicles 209 539 492 Information technology 214 277 338 $ 1,602 $ 2,636 $ 2,820 Capital Expenditures as a % of Revenue 3.5 % 5.1 % 5.7 % Other Investing Activities: Net (increase) decrease in finance receivables $ 261 $ (49 ) $ (39 ) Net (purchases) sales of marketable securities $ (11 ) $ (278 ) $ 621 Other items $ 104 $ (216 ) $ 39 We have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. In 2009, we reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our current anticipated operating needs. Future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and industry conditions. 36 Table of Contents Capital expenditures on buildings and facilities primarily resulted from our Worldport hub expansion, as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in Europe, Canada and China. In 2009, we completed the first phase of our Worldport expansion, which increased the sorting capacity by 15%. The final phase of the Worldport expansion will be completed in 2010, and will increase sorting capacity approximately 20% more. In 2008, we opened our new international air hub in Shanghai, China, and also began construction of our new intra Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China, which became operational in February 2010. Capital spending on aircraft over the 2007 to 2009 period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the Boeing 767 300 and 747 400, and MD 11 aircraft. Capital spending on vehicles was primarily for replacement assets in our package delivery and LTL operations. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2010 will be approximately $1.8 billion. The net change in finance receivables is primarily due to customer paydowns and new loan origination activity, primarily in our commercial lending, asset based lending and leasing portfolios. The purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs, and will therefore fluctuate from period to period. Other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs, the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our Boeing 767 300 and Boeing 747 400 aircraft orders, and changes in restricted cash balances. We maintain an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our self insurance obligations, and we deposited $95 and $191 million in cash collateral with the insurance carrier under this agreement during 2009 and 2008, respectively. We received (paid) cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of $117, $(208), and $(140) million during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Financing Activities Our primary uses of cash flows for financing activities are to repurchase shares, pay cash dividends, and repay debt principal, as follows (amounts in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,045 ) $ (6,702 ) $ 2,297 Share Repurchases: Cash expended for shares repurchased $ (561 ) $ (3,570 ) $ (2,639 ) Number of shares repurchased (10.9 ) (53.6 ) (35.9 ) Shares outstanding at year end 994 996 1,041 Percent reduction in shares outstanding (0.2 )% (4.3 )% (2.7 )% Dividends: Dividends declared per share $ 1.80 $ 1.80 $ 1.68 Cash expended for dividend payments $ (1,751 ) $ (2,219 ) $ (1,703 ) Borrowings: Net borrowings (repayments) of debt principal $ (522 ) $ (921 ) $ 6,509 Other Financing Activities: Cash received for common stock issuances $ 149 $ 169 $ 174 Other items $ (360 ) $ (161 ) $ (44 ) Capitalization: Total debt outstanding at year end $ 9,521 $ 9,871 $ 11,018 Total shareowners equity at year end 7,696 6,780 12,183 Total capitalization $ 17,217 $ 16,651 $ 23,201 Debt to Total Capitalization % 55.3 % 59.3 % 47.5 % 37 Table of Contents As a result of the uncertain economic environment, we have slowed our share repurchase activity. We currently intend to repurchase shares in 2010 at a rate that should approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs. In January 2008, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $10.0 billion. Share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. Unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. In 2008, the Board of Directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the November dividend declaration, as in past years this dividend was payable the following January. As a result, a total of five dividend payments were made in 2008. In February 2010, we increased our quarterly dividend payment from $0.45 to $0.47 per share. In 2007, we increased our commercial paper borrowings to fund the $6.1 billion withdrawal payment to the Central States Pension Fund upon ratification of our labor contract with the Teamsters. In 2008, we repaid most of this commercial paper with the proceeds from a $4.0 billion senior fixed rate notes offering, as well as an $850 million U.S. federal tax refund received. In 2009, we completed an additional $2.0 billion senior fixed rate notes offering. Other than commercial paper, repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations, redemption of facilities bonds and certain tranches of UPS Notes, and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt. Other financing activities include certain hedging activities and cash received from common stock issuances to employees. In conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in 2009 and 2008, we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings, which resulted in cash outflows of $243 and $84 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sources of Credit We are authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our U.S. commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2009, we had $672 million of commercial paper outstanding, with an average interest rate of 0.10% and a weighted average maturity of 17 days. The amount of commercial paper outstanding in 2010 is expected to fluctuate. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to 1.0 billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2009. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of $3.0 billion, and expires on April 15, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus a percentage determined by quotations for our 1 year credit default swap spread, subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys. If our public debt ratings are A / A2 or above, the minimum applicable margin is 1.00% and the maximum applicable margin is 2.00%; if our public debt ratings are lower than A / A2, the minimum applicable margin is 1.50% and the maximum applicable margin is 3.00%. The second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion, and expires on April 19, 2012. Interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at 90 day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities. 38 Table of Contents In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S 3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short or long term debt securities. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2009 and for all prior periods presented, we have satisfied these financial covenants. These covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur, and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale leaseback transactions, to 10% of net tangible assets. As of December 31, 2009, 10% of net tangible assets is equivalent to $2.296 billion, however we have no covered sale leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. Additionally, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth, as defined, of $5.0 billion on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2009, our net worth, as defined, was equivalent to $12.757 billion. We do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. Guarantees and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. Contractual Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): Commitment Type 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Total Capital Leases $ 122 $ 30 $ 31 $ 32 $ 33 $ 218 $ 466 Operating Leases 364 279 211 155 113 468 1,590 Debt Principal 755 5 8 1,752 1,021 5,592 9,133 Debt Interest 317 317 316 296 270 4,662 6,178 Purchase Commitments 680 541 480 370 62 20 2,153 Pension Fundings 980 908 1,075 509 211 3,683 Other Liabilities 71 69 67 64 58 81 410 Total $ 3,289 $ 2,149 $ 2,188 $ 3,178 $ 1,768 $ 11,041 $ 23,613 Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. Capital leases, operating leases, and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2009. The calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. For debt denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments. Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. As of December 31, 2009, we maintain orders for 25 Boeing 767 300ER freighters to be delivered between 2010 and 2014, and 2 Boeing 747 400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2010. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. Pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the UPS IBT Pension Plan, which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the Teamsters, as well as the UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Pension Plan. These plans are discussed further in Note 5 to the 39 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements. The pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, using discount rates, asset returns, and other assumptions appropriate for these plans. To the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections, the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above. Additionally, we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond 2014, because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable. We are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in 2010 in the UPS Retirement Plan or UPS Pension Plan. The amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods, depending on many factors, including future plan asset returns and discount rates. A sustained significant decline in the world equity markets, and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns, could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements. Such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods. The contractual payments due for other liabilities primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The table above does not include approximately $266 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities, because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. In addition, although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits, we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities. Recognized and unrecognized tax benefits are further discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $1.973 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. We also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of December 31, 2009, we had $501 million of surety bonds written. As of December 31, 2009, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $761 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which was certified as a class action in a California federal court in September 2004, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,300 full time supervisors. In August 2005, the court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims, and plaintiffs appealed the ruling. In October 2007, the appeals court reversed the lower courts ruling. In April 2008, the Court decertified the class and vacated the trial scheduled for that month. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In another case, Hohider v. UPS, which in July 2007 was certified as a class action in a Pennsylvania federal court, plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the Companys interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35,000 current and former employees, and seek back pay, and compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys fees. In August 2007, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted our petition to hear the appeal of the trial courts certification order. In July 2009, the Third Circuit issued its decision decertifying the class and remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings. We have denied any liability with respect to these 40 Table of Contents claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. UPS and our subsidiary Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate Mail Boxes Etc. centers and The UPS Store locations. These lawsuits relate to the rebranding of Mail Boxes Etc. centers to The UPS Store, The UPS Store business model, the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of The UPS Store franchises, and UPSs sale of services in the franchisees territories. In one of the actions, which is pending in California state court, the court certified a class consisting of all Mail Boxes Etc. branded stores that rebranded to The UPS Store in March 2003. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In January 2008, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging price fixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services. UPS was not named in this case. On July 21, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants. UPS and UPS Supply Chain Solutions are among the 60 defendants named in the amended complaint. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In Barber Auto Sales v. UPS, which a federal court in Alabama certified as a class action in September 2009, the plaintiff asserts a breach of contract claim arising from UPSs assessment of shipping charge corrections when UPS determines that the dimensional weight of packages is greater than reported by the shipper. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, most U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and many non U.S. jurisdictions. We have substantially resolved all U.S. federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 2003. During the third quarter of 2009, we received a refund of $271 million as a result of the resolution of tax years 1999 through 2002 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Appeals Office. For the tax years 2003 through 2004, we anticipate concluding the limited number of unagreed issues with the IRS Appeals Office by the end of the second quarter of 2010. Along with the audit for tax years 2005 through 2007, the IRS is currently examining non income based taxes, including employment and excise taxes, which could lead to proposed assessments. The IRS has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time, and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment. We anticipate receipt of the IRS reports on these matters by the end of the second quarter of 2010. We have filed all required U.S. state and local returns reporting the result of the resolution of the U.S. federal income tax audit of the tax years 1999 through 2002. A limited number of U.S. state and local matters are the subject of ongoing audits, administrative appeals or litigation. At this time, we do not expect any of the above tax matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 254,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood 41 Table of Contents of Teamsters (Teamsters). These agreements run through July 31, 2013. We have approximately 2,800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable in November 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 in October 2006. In addition, the majority (approximately 3,400) of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). In June of 2009, we reached a new agreement with the IAM, which was subsequently ratified in July 2009. The new agreement runs through July 31, 2014. Other Matters We received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the DOJs investigations into certain pricing practices in the air cargo industry in July 2006, and into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in December 2007. In October 2007, June 2008, and February 2009, we received information requests from the European Commission (Commission) relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry, and subsequently responded to each request. On February 9, 2010, UPS received a Statement of Objections by the Commission. This document contains the Commissions preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by 18 freight forwarders, including UPS. The Statement of Objections enables the addressees to respond. Although it alleges anticompetitive behavior, it does not prejudge the Commissions final decision, as to facts or law (which is subject to appeal to the European courts). We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding. We also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions. We are cooperating with each of these inquiries. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Provisions within the following accounting standards were adopted during the years covered by these financial statements: Financial Instruments: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance in February 2007 that gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an instrument by instrument basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates, such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally, this guidance allowed for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption, with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2008, and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, we recorded a $16 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008. These investments are reported in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 42 Table of Contents Compensation Retirement Benefits: We previously utilized the early measurement date option available in accounting for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, and we measured the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under guidance issued by the FASB, we were required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008. As a result of this change in measurement date, we recorded a cumulative effect after tax $44 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008. Beginning in 2009, new guidance was adopted that required disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan, investment policies and strategies, major categories of plan assets, inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. These disclosures are provided in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes: Effective beginning in 2007, guidance issued by the FASB required that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. We adopted this new standard on January 1, 2007, and the cumulative effect of adopting this standard was to recognize a $104 million decrease in the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: The FASB issued guidance on fair value measurements that took effect on January 1, 2008 and are presented in Notes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 14 to the consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2009, we implemented the previously deferred provisions of this guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The accounting requirements for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased, and for identifying transactions that are not orderly, contained the FASBs guidance were adopted on April 1, 2009, but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Derivatives and Hedging: The FASB issued certain disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging transactions that took effect on January 1, 2009 and are presented in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations: The FASB issued new accounting requirements for business combinations, which took effect on January 1, 2009. This new guidance was applied to business combinations completed in 2009, but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Consolidation: The FASB issued accounting and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests, which took effect on January 1, 2009, however this new guidance had an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2009, are not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 43 Table of Contents Contingencies As discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation. We record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that are probable and estimable, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Companys financial position as of December 31, 2009. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2009, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill and Intangible Impairment We perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis. Our reporting units are comprised of the Europe, Asia, and Americas reporting units in the International Package reporting segment, and the Forwarding & Logistics, UPS Freight, MBE / UPS Store, and UPS Capital reporting units in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is October 1st for each reporting unit. The impairment test involves a two step process. First, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values, including goodwill, is performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (DCF model), and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments. We will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods. If impairment indicators are present in future periods, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our UPS Freight reporting unit, which was formed through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million. This impairment charge resulted from several factors, including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the LTL sector, and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar LTL industry participants. At the time of acquisition of Overnite Corporation, LTL equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger. We invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance, as well as expand service offerings. However, this process took longer than initially anticipated, and thus financial results had been below our expectations. Additionally, the LTL sector in 2008 had been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the U.S., lower industrial production and retail sales, volatile fuel prices, and significant 44 Table of Contents levels of price based competition. By the fourth quarter of 2008, the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit, leading to the goodwill impairment charge. None of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008, nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2009 or 2007. Changes in our forecasts could cause book values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date (October 1, 2009) would not result in a goodwill impairment charge. All of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finite lived intangibles, and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible. If the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on a DCF model. As a result of weak performance in our domestic U.K. package operations, we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our U.K. domestic package entity. Based on recent performance and near term projections, the value assigned to the customer list intangible asset acquired within the UK domestic package business was determined to be impaired. This was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with the acquired business. Accordingly, an intangible asset impairment charge of $27 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008. No other intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2008, nor were any such impairments recognized in 2009 or 2007. Self Insurance Accruals We self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Fair Value Measurements In the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, other investments, and debt. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, 45 Table of Contents pension assets, and certain other investments. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over the counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the Market Risk section of this report. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain several single employer defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rates of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable, and represent our best estimates, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Companys costs and obligations for the year 2009 (in millions): 25 Basis PointIncrease 25 Basis PointDecrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (43 ) $ 77 Effect on projected benefit obligation (631 ) 656 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (41 ) 41 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (6 ) 5 Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (83 ) 85 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 4 (4 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 21 (22 ) Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets As of December 31, 2009, we had $17.979 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our 46 Table of Contents maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. We review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). In 2008, we had announced that we were in negotiations with DHL to provide air transportation services for all of DHLs express, deferred and international package volume within the United States, as well as air transportation services between the United States, Canada and Mexico. In early April 2009, UPS and DHL mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services. Additionally, our U.S. Domestic Package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services. As a result of these factors, the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future. Based on the factors noted above, as well as FAA aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures, we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our McDonnell Douglas DC 8 71 and DC 8 73 aircraft fleets. We conducted an impairment analysis as of March 31, 2009, and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft. Based on anticipated residual values for the airframes, engines, and parts, we recognized an impairment charge of $181 million in the first quarter of 2009. The DC 8 fleets were subsequently retired from service. As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation, we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. 47 Table of Contents We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date. These estimates require consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors. Our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk. Continued deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $138 and $155 million, respectively. Our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $254, $277, and $225 million, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of commodity, foreign exchange, and interest rate forward contracts, options, and swaps. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. Additionally, we periodically use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, however, we had no commodity option contracts outstanding. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $87 million in cash. This transaction was reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows. As these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting, were designated as hedges, and maintained their effectiveness, the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges, which extended through the first quarter of 2009. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months. Additionally, we utilize cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations. The term of these swap agreements is commensurate with the underlying debt obligations. Interest Rate Risk We have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. The notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. Additionally, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. 49 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk. These securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default. Sensitivity Analysis The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Additionally, changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions.

(2) The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates, applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments (excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances). The sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. The sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates, respectively, was not material as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. The sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. 50 Table of Contents
