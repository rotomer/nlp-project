Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The slow pace of the U.S. economic recovery in 2011 put pressure during the first three quarters of the year on volume and revenue growth in our U.S. Domestic Package segment, as well as U.S. import volume in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments. Slower growth in industrial production and the lack of significant inventory rebuilding also pressured our volume in certain industrial sectors; however, overall growth in retail sales, particularly in e commerce, resulted in solid business to consumer shipment activity during the year. Growth accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2011 due in large part to a strong holiday season for e commerce sales, which resulted in higher volume and revenue for our deferred and ground residential products. Outside of the U.S., economic growth slowed throughout 2011 due to volatility in world markets. Despite this sluggish economic environment, we experienced favorable volume and revenue growth for most of the year, although the growth trend slowed during the latter half of 2011. In 2011, we continued to undertake initiatives to improve yield management, increase operational efficiency and contain costs, which led to solid improvements in operating margin and profit in our U.S. Domestic Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments. During 2010, we completed the second phase of our Worldport expansion which has allowed the use of larger and more fuel efficient aircraft, and further improved network efficiencies. We also streamlined our U.S. domestic management structure and continued to better align our cost structure with prevailing volume levels. In our International Package segment, we have continued to invest to support our growth initiatives. In 2010, we opened our new intra Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China, which has allowed us to better serve our customers by reducing time in transit for shipments in the region. We have also continued to optimize our aircraft network, to leverage the new route authority we have gained over the last several years and to take full advantage of faster growing trade lanes. In Asia, we expanded our air network during 2011 by adding flights from Hong Kong to Cologne, Germany, adding a daily flight from Chengdu, China to Cologne, and adding new routes from Japan, as well as increasing our capacity to serve the South Korea to U.S. trade lane by adding a flight to and from Incheon. In Europe, we announced a $200 million expansion of our Cologne hub in Germany in 2011, which will increase the hubs sorting capacity from 110,000 to 190,000 packages per hour when completed in 2013. In the Americas, we have expanded our air capacity more than 50% on 19 weekly flights into key markets in Central and South America during 2011. Even though we continue to experience solid overall growth in our International Package business, in the latter half of 2011, we experienced weakness in the important Asia to U.S. trade lane. To align our capacity and cost structure with prevailing volume levels, we reduced our tonnage capacity in this lane, while retaining the network enhancements and service upgrades previously implemented. Volatile fuel prices have continued to impact both revenue and expense in all three of our segments. Rising fuel prices have led to higher fuel surcharge rates and increased fuel and purchased transportation costs. 24 Table of Contents Our consolidated results are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Revenue (in millions) $ 53,105 $ 49,545 $ 45,297 7.2 % 9.4 % Operating Expenses (in millions) 47,025 43,904 41,789 7.1 % 5.1 % Operating Profit (in millions) $ 6,080 $ 5,641 $ 3,508 7.8 % 60.8 % Operating Margin 11.4 % 11.4 % 7.7 % Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands) 15,797 15,574 15,064 1.4 % 3.4 % Average Revenue Per Piece $ 10.82 $ 10.24 $ 9.83 5.7 % 4.2 % Net Income (in millions) $ 3,804 $ 3,338 $ 1,968 14.0 % 69.6 % Basic Earnings Per Share $ 3.88 $ 3.36 $ 1.97 15.5 % 70.6 % Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 3.84 $ 3.33 $ 1.96 15.3 % 69.9 % Items Affecting Comparability The year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Operating Expenses: Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Mark to Market Charge $ 827 $ 112 $ 16 Restructuring Charge 98 Gain on Sales of Businesses (20 ) Gains on Real Estate Transactions (33 ) (109 ) Aircraft Impairment Charge 181 Interest Expense: Currency Remeasurement Charge 77 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) from the Items Above (287 ) (99 ) Charge for Change in Tax Filing Status for German Subsidiary 76 Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Mark to Market Charge In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred pre tax mark to market losses on our pension and postretirement benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $827, $112 and $16 million, respectively, on a consolidated basis ($527, $75 and $11 million after tax, respectively). These mark to market losses for 2011, 2010 and 2009 primarily resulted from decreases in the discount rates used to value our projected benefit obligations in each year. These charges impacted each of our three reporting segments in 2011 and 2010, and our International Package segment in 2009. Restructuring Charge In 2010, we streamlined the management structure in our U.S. Domestic Package segment, and incurred a restructuring charge associated with this reorganization. This pre tax charge totaled $98 million ($64 million after tax), and reflects the value of voluntary retirement benefits, severance benefits and unvested stock compensation. Gain on Sales of Businesses In 2010, we sold our UPS Logistics Technologies business unit within our Supply Chain & Freight segment, and recognized a pre tax gain of $71 million ($44 million after tax). Also in 2010, we sold a specialized 25 Table of Contents transportation business in Germany within our Supply Chain & Freight segment, and incurred a pre tax loss on the sale of $51 million ($47 million after tax), which includes a fair value adjustment loss due to a financial guarantee associated with this business sale. Gains on Real Estate Transactions In 2011, we recognized a net $33 million pre tax gain ($20 million after tax) on a consolidated basis on certain real estate transactions (consisting of a $48 million pre tax gain in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, and a $15 million pre tax loss in our U.S. Domestic Package segment). In 2010, we recognized a pre tax gain of $109 million ($61 million after tax) on the sale of real estate within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. Aircraft Impairment Charges In 2009, we completed an impairment assessment of our McDonnell Douglas DC 8 aircraft fleet, and recorded an impairment charge of $181 million ($116 million after tax), which affected our U.S. Domestic Package segment. This charge, as well as our accounting policies pertaining to long lived assets, is discussed further in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Currency Remeasurement Charge During 2009, we incurred a $77 million non cash, pre tax currency remeasurement charge ($48 million after tax) on certain foreign currency denominated obligations. Charge for Change in Tax Filing Status for German Subsidiary In 2010, we changed the tax status of a German subsidiary that was taxable in the U.S. and its local jurisdiction to one that is solely taxed in its local jurisdiction. As a result of this change in tax status, we recorded a non cash charge of $76 million to income tax expense, which resulted primarily from the write off of related deferred tax assets which will not be realizable following the change in tax status. Results of Operations Segment Review The results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments. We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non GAAP financial measures, including operating profit, operating margin, pre tax income, net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non comparable items discussed previously. We believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. We believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. 26 Table of Contents U.S. Domestic Package Operations Year Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Average Daily Package Volume (in thousands): Next Day Air 1,206 1,205 1,198 0.1 % 0.6 % Deferred 975 941 957 3.6 % (1.7 )% Ground 11,230 11,140 10,895 0.8 % 2.2 % Total Avg.

Business to consumer shipments, which 27 Table of Contents represent approximately 40% of total U.S. Domestic Package volume, experienced stronger growth than commercial volume. Volume growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, with average daily volume increasing 3.8% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Among our air products, we experienced a 4.8% increase in Next Day and Second Day air package volume, as a result of retail sales growth, with particular growth in our Next Day Air Saver product. Air letter volume declined, largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries. Within ground, our light weight products, which target low cost, non urgent ground residential deliveries, experienced solid growth during 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2011, volume growth accelerated to 12.3% and 3.5% in our deferred and ground products, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. These increases were primarily driven by higher business to consumer shipment growth during the holiday season. 2010 compared to 2009 In 2010, our overall volume increased as improvements in industrial production and retail sales increased overall demand in the U.S. small package market. Among our air products, Next Day and Second Day air package volume increased 2.1% as inventory rebuilding in the manufacturing and retailing sectors contributed to growth. However, our letter volume declined largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries. The growth in ground volume was driven by increased volume from the manufacturing and retailing sectors. Rates and Product Mix 2011 compared to 2010 Overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products during 2011 due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes, which are discussed further below. The overall revenue per piece increase was also positively affected by our focus on revenue management initiatives. In addition, the revenue per piece increase for our air products was positively impacted by the overall mix shift from letters to packages. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2011 with 2010, the average revenue per piece increase slowed to 3.4% due to the higher volume of lighter weight business to consumer packages. Revenue per piece for our ground and air products was also impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on January 3, 2011. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 5.9% on UPS Ground, while reducing our fuel surcharge indexes (discussed further below). Other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. 2010 compared to 2009 Overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products in 2010, largely due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes, which are discussed further below. The revenue per piece for our air products also improved as a result of higher average package weights and the overall mix shift from letters to packages. For both our air and ground products, revenue per piece was negatively affected by a shift in product mix to our less premium services, such as Next Day Air Saver and Ground Basic. Revenue per piece for our ground and air products was impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on January 4, 2010. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. 28 Table of Contents Fuel Surcharges UPS applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energys (DOE) Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOEs On Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows: Year Ended December 31, % Point Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Next Day Air / Deferred 13.3 % 8.0 % 4.0 % 5.3 % 4.0 % Ground 8.0 % 5.6 % 3.3 % 2.4 % 2.3 % In connection with our base rate increase on January 3, 2011, we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2% and 1%, respectively. In connection with a base rate increase on January 4, 2010, we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The 2011 and 2010 increases in the air and ground fuel surcharges were due to the significant increases in jet and diesel fuel prices each year, but partially offset by the reductions in the index on the air and ground surcharges in 2011 and the index on the air surcharge in 2010. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $884 and $592 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates discussed above. Operating Expenses 2011 compared to 2010 Overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $975 million in 2011 compared with 2010, while the total adjusted cost per piece increased 2.3% for the year. A large component of this increase relates to the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network, which increased $579 million in 2011 due largely to higher fuel costs, as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses and higher rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers, primarily railroads. Pickup and delivery costs increased $354 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a 3.1% union contractual driver wage increase. Cost increases have been mitigated due to network efficiencies that we have achieved, as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match volume levels, and continued to utilize our expanded Worldport facility to operate larger aircraft and to increase package sorting efficiency. These network efficiency improvements resulted in a 0.8% reduction in total labor hours and a 0.8% reduction in miles driven in 2011 compared with 2010. Increased delivery densities as a result of improved planning and technology, and growth in our SurePost product, have also contained increases in cost. 2010 compared to 2009 Overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $426 million in 2010 compared with 2009, while the total adjusted cost per piece decreased 0.2% for the year. Network costs increased $167 million in 2010 due largely to higher fuel costs. Pickup and delivery costs increased $148 million for the year, primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a 3.5% union contractual driver wage increase. Sort costs increased $59 million for the year, largely due to contractual union wage increases as well as higher depreciation expense for certain operating facilities, including our Worldport Hub. Network efficiencies were achieved in 2010, as we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match volume levels, and increased our package sorting efficiency. Improved pick up and delivery densities also increased productivity in our operations. These network efficiency improvements resulted in a 1.8% reduction in direct labor hours, a 6.7% reduction in aircraft block hours and a 1.4% reduction in miles driven in 2010 compared with 2009. In addition to these factors, management salary costs declined as a result of a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions. 29 Table of Contents Operating Profit and Margin 2011 compared to 2010 Higher adjusted operating profit during 2011 compared with 2010 was driven by the increased network efficiencies, combined with strong improvements in revenue per piece and a small increase in volume. Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted operating profit was particularly strong, with adjusted operating margins of 15.2% in comparison to 12.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Strong volume growth in the business to consumer sector, along with solid cost control and strong network efficiencies, were the primary factors for the fourth quarter 2011 performance. 2010 compared to 2009 Adjusted operating profit in 2010 was positively impacted by the overall economic growth in the U.S., which drove increased volume and yields. We achieved strong operating leverage through increased network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives, leading to an increase in the operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009.

Our transborder products experienced strong growth, particularly in key countries within Europe. Volume for our premium Worldwide Express and Worldwide Expedited products increased as well, particularly in the Asia to Europe, Europe to Americas and Europe to Asia export trade lanes. Additionally, intra Asia export volume experienced solid growth during 2011 compared with 2010, and was impacted by the continued economic growth in Asia overall. Our export volume growth slowed in the latter half of 2011, largely due to decelerating growth in exports out of China and the rest of Asia, as well as difficult comparisons with a relatively strong latter half of 2010. Non U.S. domestic volume increases were driven by continued strong growth in key markets, including Germany, France and Poland. 2010 compared to 2009 Export volume increased for 2010, as the worldwide economy and world trade continued to improve. We experienced strong growth in Asia, where volume grew 28% due to a combination of regional economic growth and geographic expansion of our service offerings. European export volume also had strong growth for 2010, increasing 10% compared with 2009, due to market share gains, economic growth in certain key markets, and an overall expansion of trade in the European Union. U.S. origin export volume also had solid growth during 2010. Our premium Worldwide Express and Expedited products grew at a relatively faster rate than our standard transborder and trade direct products. Non U.S. domestic volume increased 15.2% for 2010, due in part to the acquisition of Unsped Paket Servisi San ve Ticaret A.S. (Unsped) in Turkey in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the acquisition of Unsped, non U.S. domestic volume increased 9.7%, led by the strength in core European markets, Canada and Mexico. Rates and Product Mix 2011 compared to 2010 Total average revenue per piece increased 4.6% for 2011 on a currency adjusted basis. Export revenue per piece increased, largely due to a combination of higher fuel surcharge rates and base rate increases, which are discussed further below. Currency adjusted export revenue per piece increased 3.0% for 2011 compared with 2010. Product mix adversely impacted export revenue per piece, due to strong growth among our lower yielding Transborder products. Revenue per piece was pressured as average trade lanes shortened, due to volume declines in the higher yielding Asia to U.S. export lane, and higher volume growth among the relatively lower yielding intra Europe and intra Asia export lanes. Domestic revenue per piece increased 3.9% on a currency adjusted basis for 2011, largely due to comparatively faster growth in our premium express products. 31 Table of Contents On January 3, 2011, we increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service), while reducing fuel surcharge indexes. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. 2010 compared to 2009 Export revenue per piece increased during 2010, largely due to higher fuel surcharge rates, base rate increases and product mix. Export revenue per piece increased as higher yielding products (such as Worldwide Express and Worldwide Expedited) grew at a relatively faster pace. In 2010, we experienced an overall lengthening of trade lanes, as inter regional trade increased (especially in our Asia to Europe and Asia to U.S. export lanes), leading to relatively stronger growth for our premium products. The impact of currency, net of hedging, resulted in a decrease to revenue growth during the year. Domestic revenue per piece decreased, primarily due to the impact of lower yielding domestic packages from the Unsped acquisition. Total average revenue per piece increased 0.7% for the year on a currency adjusted basis. On January 4, 2010, we increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market. Fuel Surcharges In connection with our base rate increases on January 3, 2011 and January 4, 2010, we modified the fuel surcharges on certain U.S. related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2% in each of the two years. The fuel surcharges for products originating outside the United States continue to be indexed to fuel prices in the international region where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $449 and $299 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume. Operating Expenses 2011 compared to 2010 Overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $1.109 billion in 2011 compared with 2010. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in an adverse impact on operating expense comparisons between 2011 and 2010 of $198 million. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes, the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment increased 4.7% for the year. The increase in adjusted operating expenses, excluding the impact of currency, was largely due to the increased cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network, and also higher pick up and delivery costs. Network costs increased $745 million for the year, largely due to higher fuel costs and increased block hours, as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses. Pick up and delivery costs increased $123 million for the year, primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume. 2010 compared to 2009 Overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $856 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in a favorable impact on operating expense comparisons between 2010 and 2009 of $30 million. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes, the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 2.6% for the year. The increase in adjusted operating expenses, excluding the impact of currency, was primarily due to the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network, as well as pick up and delivery costs and 32 Table of Contents package sort expenses. Network costs increased $498 million for the year due largely to higher fuel costs and increased block hours. Pick up and delivery costs increased $270 million for the year, primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume. Package sorting expenses increased $61 million, and were impacted by higher labor costs and increased depreciation on certain operating facilities. Operating Profit and Margin 2011 compared to 2010 Adjusted operating profit increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010, while the segment operating margin declined for the year due to several factors. The overall increase in adjusted operating profit was largely due to the volume and revenue per piece increases previously discussed; however, the impact of these items was largely offset by excess capacity and the adverse impact of fuel prices and currency exchange rate movements. Volume softness in the Asia to U.S. trade lane in the latter half of 2011 resulted in excess transportation capacity, which pressured margins while our transportation network was being adjusted for the slowing demand. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (net of our hedging programs) resulted in an adverse impact on operating profit comparisons between 2011 and 2010 of $123 million. Additionally, fuel prices adversely impacted the operating profit comparison between 2011 and 2010, as fuel expense increased at a faster pace than fuel surcharge revenue. These factors resulted in a decrease in the operating margin in 2011 compared with 2010. 2010 compared to 2009 The increase in operating profit for 2010 was primarily driven by volume increases in all major regions and trade lanes worldwide. The shift in product mix to our higher margin premium services also contributed to the increase in operating profits. Additionally, network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives created operating leverage throughout our operations. These factors led to an increase in the operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009. 33 Table of Contents Supply Chain & Freight Operations Year Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Freight LTL Statistics: Revenue (in millions) $ 2,299 $ 2,002 $ 1,807 14.8 % 10.8 % Revenue Per Hundredweight $ 21.17 $ 19.18 $ 17.69 10.4 % 8.4 % Shipments (in thousands) 10,247 9,952 9,880 3.0 % 0.7 % Shipments Per Day (in thousands) 40.5 39.5 39.1 2.5 % 1.0 % Gross Weight Hauled (in millions of lbs) 10,858 10,440 10,211 4.0 % 2.2 % Weight Per Shipment (in lbs) 1,060 1,049 1,033 1.0 % 1.5 % Operating Days in Period 253 252 253 Revenue (in millions): Forwarding and Logistics $ 6,103 $ 6,022 $ 5,080 1.3 % 18.5 % Freight 2,563 2,208 1,943 16.1 % 13.6 % Other 473 440 417 7.5 % 5.5 % Total Revenue $ 9,139 $ 8,670 $ 7,440 5.4 % 16.5 % Operating Expenses (in millions): Operating Expenses $ 8,532 $ 8,098 $ 7,130 5.4 % 13.6 % Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Mark to Market Charge (177 ) (39 ) Gain on Real Estate Transactions 48 Gain on Sales of Businesses 20 Adjusted Operating Expenses $ 8,403 $ 8,079 $ 7,130 4.0 % 13.3 % Operating Profit (in millions) and Operating Margins: Operating Profit $ 607 $ 572 $ 310 6.1 % 84.5 % Adjusted Operating Profit $ 736 $ 591 $ 310 24.5 % 90.6 % Operating Margin 6.6 % 6.6 % 4.2 % Adjusted Operating Margin 8.1 % 6.8 % 4.2 % Currency Translation Benefit / (Cost) (in millions)*: Revenue $ 139 $ 48 Operating Profit 7 7 * Amount represents the change compared to the prior year. Revenue 2011 compared to 2010 Forwarding and logistics revenue increased in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to growth in our logistics services, where we experienced solid growth in our mail services, retail and health care solutions. Forwarding revenue decreased primarily due to volume and tonnage declines in our air and ocean forwarding businesses, as well as lower third party transportation carrier rates. The tonnage decrease was mainly the result of revenue management initiatives that improve the matching of customer pricing with market conditions, as well as the impact of the global economic slowdown. Freight revenue increased in 2011, primarily due to growth in LTL shipments, an increase in base rates, and increased fuel surcharge rates. LTL shipments per day increased in 2011, largely due to improving LTL market conditions in the first half of the year and an increase in market share. However, volume declined in the latter half of the year, and was impacted by our focus on yield management and also due to the overall LTL market being adversely impacted by the slowing economy. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased, primarily as a result of a base rate increase that took effect during the year, negotiated increases on existing contract rates and 34 Table of Contents higher fuel surcharge rates, as total fuel surcharge revenue increased $159 million for the year driven by higher diesel fuel prices. An increase in base prices took effect on August 1, 2011, as our freight unit increased minimum charge, LTL and TL rates an average of 6.9%, covering non contractual shipments in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight experienced an increase in revenue, primarily due to growth at UPS Capital, the UPS Store, UPS Customer Solutions and our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service. 2010 compared to 2009 Forwarding and logistics revenue increased in 2010, primarily due to growth in the demand for forwarding as a result of the continued expansion of the worldwide economy, inventory rebuilding and world trade. In our forwarding business, both air freight and ocean freight experienced solid revenue growth, due primarily to higher volumes, fuel surcharges, and other accessorial charges. International air freight tonnage increased 19% for 2010 compared with the prior year. In our logistics products, we experienced growth in mail services and distribution revenue, with solid increases being achieved in the health care and technology sectors. Freight revenue increased, primarily due to higher fuel surcharge rates and a base rate increase that took effect in January 2010. Average LTL shipments per day, weight per shipment and LTL revenue per hundredweight all increased during the year, largely due to our strategy of maintaining our focus on yields and targeting certain customer segments. The increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to an increase in base prices that took effect in January 2010, as UPS Freight increased minimum charge, LTL and TL rates an average of 5.7%, covering non contractual shipments in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. An additional 5.9% rate increase took effect October 18, 2010. Additionally, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased as a result of higher fuel surcharge rates, as total fuel surcharge revenue increased $105 million for the year primarily resulting from higher diesel fuel prices. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight experienced an increase in revenue. A primary driver of this increase was our UPS Customer Solutions business, which provides a range of services (e.g. project management, industrial engineering, transportation fleet services, distribution network analysis, package engineering, and package visibility). Operating Expenses 2011 compared to 2010 Forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses were flat in 2011 compared with 2010. Purchased transportation expense declined by $87 million in 2011, due to lower air freight volume as well as lower rates passed to us from third party transportation carriers. The reduction in third party carrier rates was largely due to over capacity in the Asia to U.S. trade lane that began in the latter half of 2010 and continued into the first half of 2011. This reduction in purchased transportation costs was offset by increases in several other expense categories, including other occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance, and other expenses. Freight operating expenses increased $317 million for 2011 on an adjusted basis, with the total cost per LTL shipment increasing 10.0% for the year. The two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network, which increased $134 million in 2011, and pick up, delivery and dock costs, which increased $112 million for the year. We incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet, as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers, as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume. Additionally, compensation and benefit costs increased primarily as a result of higher pension and health care costs, and effective wage increases of 4.1% for drivers in our linehaul network 35 Table of Contents and 3.5% for drivers and dock workers in our pick up and delivery network. These expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures, including pick up and delivery stops per hour, dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization. Expenses for the other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight increased $6 million in 2011 compared to 2010, and the increases were spread among several operating expense categories and business units. 2010 compared to 2009 Forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses increased $697 million in 2010 compared with 2009, due to several factors. Purchased transportation costs increased by $843 million in 2010, largely due to a strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses, as well as rapidly escalating rates on air freight due to capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of 2010. The capacity constraints in the air freight business began to recede in the second half of 2010, and the increases in purchased transportation costs lessened. Cost controls partly offset the purchased transportation expense growth, as total compensation and benefits expense declined $73 million and other occupancy expense declined by $23 million, among other factors. The decrease in compensation and benefits expense was impacted by reduced pension expense, while the decline in other occupancy expense was largely due to lower rent expense on warehouses and other facilities. Freight adjusted operating expenses increased $240 million in 2010 compared with 2009, while the total cost per LTL shipment increased 8.8% for year. The two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network which increased $73 million in 2010 compared with 2009, and pick up, delivery and dock costs which increased $98 million for the year. We incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet, as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers, as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume. Additionally, compensation and benefit costs increased primarily as a result of higher pension and health care costs, and effective wage increases of 2.0% for drivers in our linehaul network and 3.3% for drivers and dock workers in our pick up and delivery network. These expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures, including pick up and delivery stops per hour, dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization. Adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight increased by $12 million for 2010 compared with 2009, largely due to a gain recorded in 2009 (recorded as a reduction to operating expenses) on the sale of substantially all our international Mail Boxes Etc. operations. Operating Profit and Margin 2011 compared to 2010 The forwarding and logistics unit experienced an $80 million increase in adjusted operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010, largely due to revenue management initiatives and cost containment in our forwarding unit, which improved operating leverage. Additionally, excess market capacity, especially in the Asia to U.S. trade lane, reduced our purchased transportation costs and improved the operating profitability in this business. Our logistics business had a small decrease in operating profit in 2011, primarily due to our continued investment in expanding our global health care capabilities. Our freight unit had an increase of $38 million in adjusted operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to increased yields, volume growth and improved productivity in our operations. The combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased $27 million in 2011, primarily due to improved results at our UPS Capital unit. 2010 compared to 2009 Adjusted operating profit in the forwarding and logistics units increased by $245 million in 2010 compared with 2009 as a result of several factors. The operating profit increase in the forwarding unit was largely due to a 36 Table of Contents strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses, but was partially offset by capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of 2010. Capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner, resulting in a negative impact to our operating profit and margin. This situation improved during the second half of 2010, as capacity constraints lessened and we were able to implement revenue management plans which better matched customer pricing with market conditions. Our logistics unit had a solid increase in profitability in 2010, which was driven primarily by an expansion of operating margins due to operating efficiencies and a focus on higher margin industry sectors. Adjusted operating profit for our UPS Freight unit increased by $25 million in 2010 compared with the prior year, largely due to better productivity, and increases in base pricing and volume. Productivity metrics increased, including increases in pickup and delivery stops per hour and linehaul utilization. All of the remaining businesses combined within this segment increased adjusted operating profit by $11 million during the year, primarily due to improved results in our UPS Capital business unit. Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Operating Expenses (in millions): Compensation and Benefits $ 27,575 $ 26,557 $ 25,933 3.8 % 2.4 % Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Mark to Market Charge (827 ) (112 ) (16 ) Restructuring Charge (98 ) Adjusted Compensation and Benefits 26,748 26,347 25,917 1.5 % 1.7 % Repairs and Maintenance 1,286 1,131 1,075 13.7 % 5.2 % Depreciation and Amortization 1,782 1,792 1,747 (0.6 )% 2.6 % Purchased Transportation 7,232 6,640 5,379 8.9 % 23.4 % Fuel 4,046 2,972 2,365 36.1 % 25.7 % Other Occupancy 943 939 985 0.4 % (4.7 )% Other Expenses 4,161 3,873 4,305 7.4 % (10.0 )% Gain on Real Estate Transactions 33 109 Gain on Sales of Businesses 20 Aircraft Impairment Charge (181 ) Adjusted Other Expenses 4,194 4,002 4,124 4.8 % (3.0 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 47,025 $ 43,904 $ 41,789 7.1 % 5.1 % Adjusted Total Operating Expenses 46,231 43,823 41,592 5.5 % 5.4 % Currency Translation Cost $ 330 $ 11 Compensation and Benefits 2011 compared to 2010 Employee payroll costs increased $237 million in 2011 compared with 2010, largely due to contractual union wage rate increases that took effect under our collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters, but partially offset by a decline in union labor hours. Management payroll costs declined slightly primarily due to a lower management incentive award. Adjusted benefits expense increased $164 million in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to higher employee health and welfare costs and expense associated with our self insurance for workers compensation claims, but partially offset by a decline in pension expense. These factors are discussed further as follows: Employee health and welfare program costs increased $132 million in 2011, and were impacted by higher required union plan contribution rates and general health care inflation. 37 Table of Contents The expense associated with our self insurance programs for workers compensation claims increased by $48 million in 2011. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported. Insurance reserves also take into account a number of factors including our history of claim losses, payroll growth and the impact of safety improvement initiatives. In 2010, we experienced more favorable actuarial expense adjustments compared with 2011, thus leading to the increase in expense in 2011. Adjusted pension expense decreased $50 million in 2011 due to several factors. Most significantly, contributions to the company sponsored pension plans in 2011 increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes. The increase in the expected return on assets more than offset increased service and interest costs (due to a decline in discount rates), resulting in a net reduction in pension expense. This was partially offset by higher contribution rates for multiemployer pension plans, as well as the reinstatement of matching contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan. 2010 compared to 2009 The increase in adjusted compensation and benefits expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was impacted by several items. Payroll costs increased $416 million, largely due to higher accruals for management incentive compensation plans resulting from improved company financial results. Union payroll costs also increased due to contractual wage increases. These factors were partially offset by a decline in union labor hours, as well as a reduction in management salary costs resulting from a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions. Adjusted benefits expense increased $14 million in 2010 compared with 2009, due largely to increases in health and welfare costs and relocation related benefits for management employees. The increase in health and welfare costs, which was primarily driven by health cost inflation, was somewhat mitigated by reductions in the total number of management employees and union employees covered by UPS sponsored health and welfare benefit plans. The relocation benefit costs relate to the restructuring of our domestic package operations that occurred in the first quarter of 2010. These increases were largely offset by a reduction in pension expense, due to an increase in the expected return on assets more than offsetting increasing service and interest costs. The increased expected return on assets was largely due to significant contributions to company sponsored pension plans in 2010. Repairs and Maintenance 2011 compared to 2010 The increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to aircraft maintenance costs, which increased $121 million in 2011 compared with 2010. This increase resulted from an increase in flight hours due to higher air volume, additional scheduled maintenance checks and higher contractual maintenance rates. The remaining increase in repairs and maintenance expense primarily relates to higher maintenance costs on our office buildings and operating facilities. 2010 compared to 2009 The increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was largely due to maintenance costs on our vehicle fleet, which increased by $35 million during the year. The remaining increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to higher maintenance costs on our aircraft fleet and operating facilities. 38 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization 2011 compared to 2010 The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 was primarily the result of a reduction in depreciation expense on technology equipment and software. This decline was primarily related to certain technology hardware and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated. 2010 compared to 2009 Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2010, primarily as a result of depreciation expense on equipment and facilities capitalized in conjunction with the recent Worldport expansion. Amortization of intangible assets also increased as a result of new intangibles recognized related to the Unsped acquisition in Turkey in the third quarter of 2009, as well as corporate sponsorships entered into in 2010. Purchased Transportation 2011 compared to 2010 The increase in purchased transportation in 2011 was caused by a combination of higher volume, as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by third party air, ocean and truck carriers across all segments. The combination of these factors increased expense by $387 million in 2011. Additionally, we incurred a $97 million increase in expense in 2011 for the use of rail carriers, which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges, as well as increased volumes. The remaining increase in expense for 2011 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate changes. 2010 compared to 2009 The increase in purchased transportation in 2010 was caused by several factors, including higher volume, as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by third party air, ocean and truck carriers. The combination of these factors increased expense by $1.224 billion in 2010 compared with 2009. Additionally, the expense for the use of rail carriers increased $53 million, which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges, as well as increased volumes. Partially offsetting these increases in expense for 2010 was the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Fuel 2011 compared to 2010 The increase in fuel expense in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily caused by higher prices for jet A fuel, diesel and unleaded gasoline, which increased expense by $982 million. Higher usage of these products in our operations accounted for the remaining increase in expense of $92 million in 2011. 2010 compared to 2009 In 2010, higher prices for jet A fuel, diesel, and unleaded gasoline increased fuel expense by $564 million compared with 2009, while greater fuel usage increased expense by $43 million. Other Occupancy 2011 compared to 2010 Other occupancy expense increased in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to an increase in utilities expense resulting from increased electricity costs in our facilities. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher rent expense resulting from increased rates on warehouses. 39 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009 The decrease in other occupancy expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to decreased labor and overhead expenses, and lower rent expense on leased facilities. Other Expenses 2011 compared to 2010 The increase in adjusted other expenses in 2011 compared with 2010 was caused by several factors, including foreign currency remeasurement losses, advertising costs, employee expense reimbursements, equipment rentals, air cargo handling costs and data processing fees. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt and employee relocation expenses. 2010 compared to 2009 The decrease in adjusted other expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 was largely due to reductions in bad debt expense and foreign currency transaction expense, which reflected gains during 2010 compared to losses in 2009. Additionally, we incurred a loss on the sale of a French repair business in 2009. Additional expense reductions in 2010 were due to cost containment programs, including reductions in telecom costs, office supplies, and outside professional fees. We also incurred lower expenses associated with auto liability insurance and customer claims for lost or damaged packages. Investment Income and Interest Expense The following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Investment Income $ 44 $ 3 $ 10 N/A (70.0 )% Interest Expense $ (348 ) $ (354 ) $ (445 ) (1.7 )% (20.4 )% Impact of Currency Remeasurement Charge 77 Adjusted Interest Expense $ (348 ) $ (354 ) $ (368 ) (1.7 )% (3.8 )% Investment Income The increase in investment income in 2011 compared with 2010 was caused by a combination of factors. During 2011, we realized $20 million in net gains on the sales of auction rate securities, preferred equity securities and an S&P 500 index fund, as well as a mark to market gain on investments. In 2010, we recorded a $21 million impairment on certain asset backed auction rate securities, which resulted from provisions that allowed the issuers of the securities to subordinate our holdings to newly issued debt or to tender for the securities at less than their par value. Additionally in 2010, we recorded an $8 million loss on the sale of auction rate securities. The remaining change in investment income was caused by a lower yield earned on our invested assets; however, this was largely offset by a higher average balance of interest earning investments in our portfolio. The decrease in investment income in 2010 was primarily due to a lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the United States, as well as higher impairment losses on our holdings of auction rate and preferred securities. Interest Expense Interest expense declined slightly in 2011 due to a lower average interest rate incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, which reduced expense by $60 million for 2011 compared with 2010. However, this was largely offset as a result of a higher average balance of outstanding debt in 2011 compared with 2010. 40 Table of Contents The decrease in adjusted interest expense in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to lower average debt balances, but this was partially offset by lower capitalized interest, due to the recent completion of several large construction projects, including our Worldport expansion. Income Tax Expense The following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Income Tax Expense $ 1,972 $ 1,952 $ 1,105 1.0 % 76.7 % Income Tax Impact of: Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Mark to Market Charge 300 37 5 Change in Tax Filing Status for German Subsidiary (76 ) Restructuring Charge 34 Gain on Sales of Businesses (23 ) Gain on Real Estate Transactions (13 ) (48 ) Aircraft Impairment Charge 65 Currency Remeasurement Charge 29 Adjusted Income Tax Expense $ 2,259 $ 1,876 $ 1,204 20.4 % 55.8 % Effective Tax Rate 34.1 % 36.9 % 36.0 % Adjusted Effective Tax Rate 34.4 % 34.9 % 36.0 % 2011 compared to 2010 Adjusted income tax expense increased primarily due to higher pre tax income. Our adjusted effective tax rate declined in 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of several factors, including changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, the relative proportion of taxable income in certain non U.S. jurisdictions, and favorable developments with U.S. state tax audit and litigation matters. 2010 compared to 2009 The increase in our effective tax rate in 2010 compared with 2009 was attributable to the higher marginal tax rate applied to the gain on the sale of real estate, as well as the change in the tax filing status of a German subsidiary that occurred in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally, we were unable to recognize the entire potential tax benefit of tax loss carryforwards generated from the sale of a Supply Chain & Freight business in Germany in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding these items, our adjusted effective tax rate decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the effect of having a higher proportion of our taxable income in 2010 being subject to tax outside the United States, where statutory tax rates are generally lower. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities The following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (amounts in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net income $ 3,804 $ 3,338 $ 1,968 Non cash operating activities(a) 4,505 4,398 4,047 Pension and postretirement plan contributions (UPS sponsored plans) (1,436 ) (3,240 ) (924 ) Income tax receivables and payables 236 (319 ) 245 Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities (12 ) (340 ) (137 ) Other operating activities (24 ) (2 ) 86 Net cash from operating activities $ 7,073 $ 3,835 $ 5,285 (a) Represents depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on derivative and foreign exchange transactions, deferred income taxes, provisions for uncollectible accounts, pension and postretirement benefit expense, stock compensation expense, impairment charges and other non cash items. Cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2009 to 2011 time period. Operating cash flow was favorably impacted in 2011, compared with 2010, by higher net income, changes in our working capital position, the timing of income tax payments and the amount of contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. The favorable changes in working capital were impacted by the change in the timing of the elective awards under our management incentive awards program, which shifted the payout of $253 million in awards from 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. The change in the cash flows for income tax receivables and payables in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to the timing of discretionary pension contributions during 2010, as discussed further in the following paragraph. Except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans, contributions to our company sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans. In 2011, we made a $1.2 billion contribution to the UPS IBT Pension Plan, which satisfied our 2011 contribution requirements and also approximately $440 million in contributions that would not have been required until after 2011. In 2010, operating cash flow was reduced by $2.0 billion in discretionary contributions to our UPS Retirement and UPS Pension Plans, and $980 million in required contributions to our UPS IBT Pension Plan. In 2009, operating cash flow was reduced by $778 million in required contributions to our UPS IBT Pension Plan. The remaining contributions in the 2009 through 2011 period were largely due to contributions to our international pension plans and U.S. postretirement medical benefit plans. As discussed further in the Contractual Commitments section, we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years, primarily related to the UPS IBT Pension, UPS Retirement and UPS Pension plans. 42 Table of Contents Investing Activities Our primary sources (uses) of cash for investing activities were as follows (amounts in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,537 ) $ (654 ) $ (1,248 ) Capital Expenditures: Buildings and facilities $ (373 ) $ (352 ) $ (568 ) Aircraft and parts (598 ) (416 ) (611 ) Vehicles (659 ) (339 ) (209 ) Information technology (375 ) (282 ) (214 ) $ (2,005 ) $ (1,389 ) $ (1,602 ) Capital Expenditures as a % of Revenue 3.8 % 2.8 % 3.5 % Other Investing Activities: Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment $ 27 $ 304 $ 60 Net decrease in finance receivables $ 184 $ 108 $ 261 Net (purchases) sales of marketable securities $ (413 ) $ 30 $ (11 ) Cash received (paid) for business acquisitions and dispositions $ (73 ) $ 63 $ (9 ) Other investing activities $ (257 ) $ 230 $ 53 We have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Capital spending increased in 2011 to support several growth initiatives. In 2010 and 2009, we had reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our operating needs in the economic environment at that time. Future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and industry conditions. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately $2.2 billion, or approximately 4% of revenue. Capital spending on aircraft over the 2009 to 2011 period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the Boeing 767 300 and 747 400 aircraft. Capital spending on vehicles increased during 2010 and 2011 in our U.S. and international package businesses and our freight unit, due to vehicle replacements, technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth. Capital expenditures on buildings and facilities declined over the 2009 through 2011 period, primarily resulting from the completion of several large hub construction and expansion projects, including our Worldport hub expansion. In 2009, we completed the first phase of our Worldport expansion, which increased the sorting capacity by 15%. The final phase of the Worldport expansion was completed in 2010, with an additional sorting capacity of approximately 20%. We anticipate that capital spending on buildings and facilities will increase in 2012, due to expansion and new construction projects at facilities in Europe and Asia, including a $200 million expansion at our European air hub in Cologne, Germany during 2012 and 2013. The 2010 increase in proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment is largely due to real estate sales and the proceeds from insurance recoveries. The net decline in finance receivables in the 2009 through 2011 period is primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity, primarily in our commercial lending, asset based lending and leasing portfolios. The purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types, and will therefore fluctuate from period to period. The cash paid for business acquisitions in 2011 was largely due to the acquisition of Pieffe Group in Italy. The cash received from business dispositions in 2010 was largely due to the sale of UPS Logistics Technologies, Inc. In 2009, the cash outflow for the purchase of Unsped Paket Servisi San ve Ticaret A.S. was largely offset by the cash received from the sale of the international franchise operations of our Mail Boxes Etc. unit. 43 Table of Contents Other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our currency hedging programs, the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our Boeing 767 300 and Boeing 747 400 aircraft orders, and the equity investments in five new leveraged aircraft leases. We received (paid) cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of $(78), $111 and $117 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Financing Activities Our primary sources (uses) of cash for financing activities are as follows (amounts in millions, except per share data): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash used in financing activities $ (4,862 ) $ (1,346 ) $ (3,045 ) Share Repurchases: Cash expended for shares repurchased $ (2,665 ) $ (817 ) $ (561 ) Number of shares repurchased (38.7 ) (12.4 ) (10.9 ) Shares outstanding at year end 963 991 994 Percent reduction in shares outstanding (2.8 )% (0.3 )% (0.2 )% Dividends: Dividends declared per share $ 2.08 $ 1.88 $ 1.80 Cash expended for dividend payments $ (1,997 ) $ (1,818 ) $ (1,751 ) Borrowings: Net borrowings (repayments) of debt principal $ (95 ) $ 1,246 $ (522 ) Other Financing Activities: Cash received for common stock issuances $ 290 $ 218 $ 149 Other financing activities $ (395 ) $ (175 ) $ (360 ) Capitalization: Total debt outstanding at year end $ 11,128 $ 10,846 $ 9,521 Total shareowners equity at year end 7,108 8,047 7,696 Total capitalization $ 18,236 $ 18,893 $ 17,217 Debt to Total Capitalization % 61.0 % 57.4 % 55.3 % In January 2008, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $10.0 billion. Share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. As a result of the uncertain economic environment in 2010 and 2009, we slowed our share repurchase activity, and repurchased shares at a rate that approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs. Unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program. As of December 31, 2011, we had $2.525 billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining. In 2012, pending Board of Directors approval of an additional share repurchase authorization, we anticipate repurchasing approximately $2.7 billion in shares. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. In February 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend payment from $0.52 to $0.57 per share, a 10% increase. Issuances of debt in 2011 consisted primarily of commercial paper and five new aircraft leases. In 2010 and 2009, we completed senior fixed rate note offerings of $2.0 billion in each year. These note offerings were used for various purposes, including discretionary contributions to UPS sponsored pension plans, the retirement of existing debt instruments and other general corporate purposes. 44 Table of Contents Repayments of debt in 2011, 2010 and 2009 consisted primarily of paydowns of commercial paper, early redemptions of our UPS Notes program and certain facilities bonds, and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $341 million outstanding at December 31, 2010. The amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout each year based on daily liquidity needs. The average commercial paper balance was $849 million and the average interest rate paid was 0.08% in 2011 ($947 million and 0.14% in 2010, respectively). Cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in 2011 and 2010. The cash outflows in other financing activities are largely due to repurchases of shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations, as well as certain hedging activities on forecasted debt issuances and premiums paid on capped call options for the purchase of UPS class B shares. In conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in 2010 and 2009, we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings, which resulted in cash inflows (outflows) of $7 and $(243) million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had paid premiums of $200 million on capped call options for the purchase of 3.3 million class B shares that will settle in the first half of 2012. Sources of Credit We are authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our U.S. commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2011, we had no commercial paper outstanding. The amount of commercial paper outstanding in 2012 is expected to fluctuate. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to 1.0 billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2011. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of $1.5 billion, and expires on April 12, 2012. Generally, amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR for the applicable interest period and currency denomination, plus an applicable margin. Alternatively, a fluctuating rate of interest equal to Citibanks publicly announced base rate, plus an applicable margin, may be used at our discretion. In each case, the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on LIBOR is a percentage determined by quotations from Markit Group Ltd. for our 1 year credit default swap spread, subject to a minimum rate of 0.15% and a maximum rate of 0.75%. The applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is 1.00% below the applicable margin for LIBOR advances (but not lower than 0.00%). We are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2011. The second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion, and expires on April 14, 2015. Generally, amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR for the applicable interest period and currency denomination, plus an applicable margin. Alternatively, a fluctuating rate of interest equal to Citibanks publicly announced base rate, plus an applicable margin, may be used at our discretion. In each case, the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on LIBOR is a percentage determined by quotations from Markit Group Ltd. for our credit default swap spread, interpolated for a period from the date of determination of such credit default swap spread in connection with a new interest period until the latest maturity date of this facility then in effect (but not less than a period of one year). The applicable margin is subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from Standard & Poors Rating Service and Moodys Investors Service. The minimum applicable margin rates range from 0.250% to 0.500%, and the maximum applicable margin rates range from 1.000% to 1.500%. The applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is 1.00% below the applicable margin for LIBOR advances (but not less than 0.00%). We are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2011. 45 Table of Contents Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2011 and for all prior periods presented, we have satisfied these financial covenants. These covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur, and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale leaseback transactions, to 10% of net tangible assets. As of December 31, 2011, 10% of net tangible assets is equivalent to $2.550 billion, however we have no covered sale leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. Additionally, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth, as defined, of $5.0 billion on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2011, our net worth, as defined, was equivalent to $10.138 billion. We do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. Guarantees and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. Contractual Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Commitment Type 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Total Capital Leases $ 59 $ 56 $ 51 $ 50 $ 48 $ 474 $ 738 Operating Leases 329 257 192 140 97 393 1,408 Debt Principal 1,750 1,000 100 7,366 10,216 Debt Interest 315 292 263 257 257 4,622 6,006 Purchase Commitments 517 453 32 16 34 1,052 Pension Fundings 355 738 1,081 702 1,161 1,818 5,855 Other Liabilities 67 64 58 43 23 15 270 Total $ 1,642 $ 3,610 $ 2,677 $ 1,308 $ 1,620 $ 14,688 $ 25,545 Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. Capital leases, operating leases, and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2011. The calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. For debt denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments. Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. As of December 31, 2011, we have firm commitments to purchase 15 Boeing 767 300ER freighters to be delivered between 2012 and 2013. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for anticipated future growth. Pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified pension plans. These contributions include those to the UPS IBT Pension Plan, the UPS Pension Plan and the UPS Retirement Plan. These plans are discussed further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, using discount rates, asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans. To the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our 46 Table of Contents current projections, the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above. Additionally, we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond 2017, because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable. We are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in 2012 in the UPS Retirement Plan or UPS Pension Plan. The amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods, depending on many factors, including future plan asset returns and discount rates. A sustained significant decline in the world equity markets, and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns, could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements. Such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods. As discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. Contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process. As we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels, we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans. The contractual payments due for other liabilities primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The table above does not include approximately $252 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. In addition, we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions are further discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $1.551 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. We also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of December 31, 2011, we had $583 million of surety bonds written. As of December 31, 2011, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $248 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are involved in a number of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, we have generally denied, or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny, liability in all litigation pending against us, including the matters described below, and we intend to defend vigorously each case. We have accrued for legal claims when, and to the extent that, amounts associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims. For those matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss, we are not able to determine whether the loss will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or liquidity. For matters in this category, we have indicated in the descriptions that follow the reasons that we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Judicial Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws. At this time, we do not believe that any loss associated with these matters, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. UPS and our subsidiary Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in two lawsuits about the rebranding or purchase of The UPS Store franchises Morgate and Samica. We prevailed at the trial court level in both cases, 47 Table of Contents and plaintiffs appealed. Morgate was filed in March 2003. The plaintiffs are 125 individual franchisees who did not rebrand and a certified class of all franchisees who did rebrand to The UPS Store. A bellwether trial for three individual plaintiffs was set for early 2010, but the trial court entered judgment against one of the three plaintiffs prior to trial, which was affirmed in January 2012. The trial court also granted our motion for summary judgment against the members of the certified class, which was reversed in January 2012. The remainder of the case has been stayed pending appeal. Samica was filed in March 2006. The plaintiffs are 250 individual The UPS Store franchisees who either elected to rebrand or purchased new The UPS Store franchises. Summary judgment was granted in UPSs favor and affirmed on appeal in December 2011. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from these matters including: (1) three separate components of these cases are being appealed to federal and state courts following decisions favorable to UPS and we cannot predict the final outcomes of these appeals; and (2) it remains uncertain what evidence of damages, if any, plaintiffs will be able to present if any aspects of these cases proceed forward. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In Barber Auto Sales v. UPS, which a federal court in Alabama certified as a class action in September 2009, the plaintiff asserts a breach of contract claim arising from UPSs assessment of shipping charge corrections when UPS determines that the dimensional weight of packages is greater than that reported by the shipper. On June 1, 2011, we reached an agreement in principle to settle the case for an immaterial amount. The settlement has been preliminarily approved, and remains subject to a final fairness hearing. In AFMS LLC v. UPS and FedEx Corporation, a lawsuit filed in federal court in the Central District of California in August 2010, the plaintiff asserts that UPS and FedEx violated U.S. antitrust law by conspiring to refuse to negotiate with third party negotiators retained by shippers and or to monopolize a so called market for shipping consultation services. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has informed us that it has opened a civil investigation of our policies and practices for dealing with third party negotiators. We are cooperating with this investigation. We deny any liability with respect to these matters and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from these matters including: (1) we believe that we have a number of meritorious defenses; (2) AFMS has not articulated any measure of damages; and (3) the DOJ investigation is ongoing. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In Canada, three purported class action cases were filed against us in British Columbia (2006); Ontario (2007) and Qu&eacute;bec (2006). The cases each allege inadequate disclosure concerning the existence and cost of brokerage services provided by us under applicable provincial consumer protection legislation and infringement of interest restriction provisions under the Criminal Code of Canada. The British Columbia class action was declared inappropriate for certification and dismissed by the trial judge. That decision was upheld by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in March 2010, which ended the case in our favor. The Ontario class action was certified in September 2011. Partial summary judgment was granted to us and the plaintiffs by the Ontario motions court. The complaint under the Criminal Code was dismissed. No appeal is being taken from that decision. The allegations of inadequate disclosure were granted and we are appealing that decision. The request to certify the case in Qu&eacute;bec will be heard in February 2012. We have denied all liability and are vigorously defending the two outstanding cases. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from these matters, including (1) we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and (2) there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of these matters. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. 48 Table of Contents Other Matters In May and December 2007 and August 2008 we received and responded to grand jury subpoenas from the DOJ in the Northern District of California in connection with an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration. We also have responded to informal requests for information in connection with this investigation, which relates to transportation of packages on behalf of on line pharmacies that may have operated illegally. We are cooperating with this investigation and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from this matter, including (1) we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and (2) there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of this matter. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We received a grand jury subpoena from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ regarding the DOJs investigation into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in December 2007. In October 2007, June 2008 and February 2009, we received information requests from the European Commission (Commission) relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry, and subsequently responded to each request. In February 2010, UPS received a Statement of Objections by the Commission. This document contains the Commissions preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by 18 freight forwarders, including UPS. Although it alleges anticompetitive behavior, it does not prejudge the Commissions final decision, as to facts or law (which is subject to appeal to the European courts). The options available to the Commission include taking no action or imposing a monetary fine; the range of any potential action by the Commission is not reasonably estimable. Any decision imposing a fine would be subject to appeal. UPS has responded to the Statement of Objections, including at a July 2010 Commission hearing, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding. We received additional information requests from the Commission in January and July 2011, and we have responded to those requests. In August 2010, competition authorities in Brazil opened an administrative proceeding to investigate alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry. Approximately 45 freight forwarding companies and individuals are named in the proceeding, including UPS, UPS SCS Transportes (Brasil) S.A., and a former employee in Brazil. UPS will have an opportunity to respond to these allegations. We are cooperating with each of these investigations, and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from these matters including (1) we are vigorously defending each matter and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses; (2) there are unresolved questions of law that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters, including the calculation of any potential fine; and (3) there is uncertainty about the time period that is the subject of the investigations. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In January 2008, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging price fixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services. UPS was not named in this case. In July 2009, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants. UPS and UPS Supply Chain Solutions are among the 60 defendants named in the amended complaint. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from these matters including: (1) the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant our motion to dismiss, with leave to amend, and the scope of the plaintiffs claims is therefore unclear; (2) the scope and size of the proposed class is 49 Table of Contents ill defined; (3) there are significant legal questions about the adequacy and standing of the putative class representatives; and (4) we believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We do not believe that the eventual resolution of these other lawsuits (either individually or in the aggregate), including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In June 2011, we received Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports covering income taxes and excise taxes for tax years 2005 through 2007 and 2003 through 2007, respectively. The reports propose assessments related to amounts paid for software, research credit expenditures and deductibility of financing and post acquisition integration costs as well as taxes on amounts paid for air transportation. Receipt of the reports represents only the conclusion of the examination process. We disagree with the proposed assessments related to these matters. Therefore, we have filed protests and protective tax refund claims. During the third quarter of 2011, the IRS responded to our protests and forwarded the cases to IRS Appeals. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from these matters including: (1) we are vigorously defending these matters and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses; (2) we have filed refund claims in excess of the proposed assessments; (3) there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters, including the calculation of any additional taxes and or tax refunds; and (4) these matters are at the initial stage of a multi level administrative appeals process that may ultimately be resolved by litigation. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Collective Bargaining Agreements As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 245,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. These agreements run through July 31, 2013. We have approximately 2,700 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the IPA, which became amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which runs through November 1, 2013. In addition, approximately 3,200 of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the IAM. Our agreement with the IAM runs through July 31, 2014. We participate in a number of trustee managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in, and we are in compliance with these contribution rates. These limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements. Rate Adjustments In November 2011, we announced an increase in base rates and changes in our fuel surcharge for package shipments that took effect January 2, 2012. UPS Ground service rates increased a net 4.9% through a combination of a 5.9% increase in rates and a 1% reduction in the index used to determine the ground fuel surcharge. UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select, and international air shipments originating in the United States (including Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard Service) increased a net 4.9%, through a combination of a 6.9% increase in base rates and 50 Table of Contents a 2% reduction in the index used to determine the air fuel surcharge. These rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update regarding disclosure of an employers participation in multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans. This new guidance requires companies to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financial obligations, risks and commitments, as well as the level of participation in multiemployer plans. Companies are required to disclose detailed information about significant multiemployer plans, including contributions made to the plans, financial health and funded status of the plans, and expiration of the collective bargaining agreements that require contributions to the plans. This accounting standards update impacted our disclosures only, and did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The disclosures required by this accounting standards update are presented in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that amends the accounting guidance on goodwill impairment testing. This accounting standards update is intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. This accounting standards update also amends existing guidance by expanding upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We adopted this accounting standards update and applied its provisions to certain of our reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2011. Other accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective Accounting pronouncements issued, but not effective until after December 31, 2011, are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. 51 Table of Contents The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation. We record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that are probable and estimable, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to our financial position as of December 31, 2011. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2011, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill and Intangible Impairment We perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis. Our reporting units are comprised of the Europe, Asia, and Americas reporting units in the International Package reporting segment, and the Forwarding, Logistics, UPS Freight, MBE / The UPS Store and UPS Capital reporting units in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is October 1st for each reporting unit. In assessing goodwill for impairment, we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit, then we utilize a two step process to test goodwill for impairment. First, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value, including goodwill, is performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (DCF model), and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our business strategy, government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments. We will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods. If impairment indicators are present in future periods, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. None of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. As of our October 1, 2011 goodwill impairment testing date, our UPS Freight reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. The fair value of this reporting unit was negatively impacted in 2011 by the difficult market environment for the LTL industry, resulting in reduced equity valuations for market comparable companies. Several factors, including lower than expected revenues and or operating margins, an increased cost of capital and higher than anticipated capital expenditure requirements, could result in the reporting units fair value declining below its carrying value in a future period. Additionally, a sustained decline in the valuations of publicly traded comparable companies in the LTL industry would also reduce the calculated fair value of this reporting unit. Our UPS Freight reporting unit has a total goodwill balance of $441 million as of December 31, 2011. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of our other reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date (October 1, 2011) would not result in a goodwill impairment charge. 52 Table of Contents Licenses with a carrying value of $5 million as of December 31, 2011 are deemed to be indefinite lived intangibles, and therefore are not amortized. Impairment tests for indefinite lived intangibles are performed on an annual basis. All of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finite lived intangibles, and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible. If the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on a DCF model. No impairments of indefinite lived or finite lived intangible assets were recognized in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Self Insurance Accruals We self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Fair Value Measurements In the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, other investments and debt. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, pension assets and certain other investments. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over the counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices is presented in the Market Risk section of this report. 53 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors. The assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are (1) changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and (2) differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we elected to change our accounting methodologies for recognizing expense for our company sponsored U.S. and International pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations (the corridor) were recognized over the average remaining service life of employees in each respective plan. Further, for our largest pension plan (the UPS Retirement Plan), we used a calculated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period. Under our new accounting methods, we will recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year. These new accounting methods result in changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses being recognized in expense faster than our previous amortization method. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, will be recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense (herein referred to as ongoing expense or ongoing net periodic benefit cost). The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, and the resulting increase (decrease) on our obligations and ongoing expense as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2011 (in millions). 25 Basis PointIncrease 25 Basis PointDecrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost $ (43 ) $ 45 Effect on projected benefit obligation (976 ) 1,017 Return on Assets: Effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost (54 ) 54 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (102 ) 105 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost 1 (1 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 15 (16 ) 54 Table of Contents Ongoing expense will increase in 2012 compared with 2011, due primarily to the decline in the U.S. discount rate used to determine expense from 5.95% for 2011 to 5.61% for 2012. This is partially offset by the contributions to the plans in 2011 that increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes. Depreciation, Residual Value and Impairment of Fixed Assets As of December 31, 2011, we had $17.621 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. We review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). In 2011 and 2010, there were no indicators of impairment in our aircraft fleet, and no impairment charges were recorded in either period. In 2009, we recorded a $181 million impairment charge, as described in the following paragraphs. In 2008, we had announced that we were in negotiations with DHL to provide air transportation services for all of DHLs express, deferred and international package volume within the United States, as well as air transportation services between the United States, Canada and Mexico. In early April 2009, UPS and DHL mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services. Additionally, our U.S. Domestic Package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services. As a result of these factors, the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future. Based on the factors noted above, as well as FAA aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures, we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our McDonnell Douglas DC 8 71 and DC 8 73 aircraft fleets. We conducted an impairment analysis as of March 31, 2009, and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft. Based on anticipated residual values for the airframes, engines, and parts, we recognized an impairment charge of $181 million in the first quarter of 2009. The DC 8 fleets were subsequently retired from service. 55 Table of Contents Income Taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date. These estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors. Our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk. Deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $117 and $127 million, respectively. Our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $147, $199 and $254 million, respectively. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts, options and swaps. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. 56 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet A, diesel and unleaded gasoline. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. Additionally, we periodically use a combination of option contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, however, we had no commodity option contracts outstanding. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months. Additionally, we utilize cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations. The terms of these swap agreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations. Interest Rate Risk We have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. We have investments in debt securities, as well as cash equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. Additionally, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk. These securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds. Sensitivity Analysis The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves and 57 Table of Contents commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Additionally, changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions. Shock Test Result As of December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Change in Fair Value: Currency Derivatives(1) $ (64 ) $ (89 ) Change in Annual Expense: Variable Rate Debt(2) $ 7 $ 10 Interest Rate Derivatives(2) $ 71 $ 58 (1) The potential change in fair value from a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities. (2) The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates, applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments (excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances). The sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. The sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates, respectively, was not material as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. The sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. 58 Table of Contents
