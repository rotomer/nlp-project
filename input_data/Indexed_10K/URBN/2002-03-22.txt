Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our historical results of operations and of our liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their related notes included elsewhere in this report. General Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2002 ended on January 31, 2002. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. We operate two business segments a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business that we refer to as Free People. The retailing segment operates through retail stores and direct to consumer, including a catalog and two web sites. The two retail concepts are Urban Outfitters, which we refer to as Urban Retail, and Anthropologie. Urban Retail had 49 stores open at January 31, 2002 and 42 at January 31, 2001. Anthropologie had 31 stores open at January 31, 2002 and 26 at January 31, 2001. We have plans to open approximately 12 to 14 stores during this fiscal year, of which two had opened as of March 20, 2002. Our goal thereafter is to increase net sales 20 25% per year through a combination of increasing selling square footage, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. We have wholly owned subsidiaries that operate Urban Retail stores in London and Glasgow, in Dublin and in Montreal and Toronto, which are included in the store numbers given above. The results of operations and financial position for these stores are included in our retail operations segment results. We may open additional stores outside the United States, though none are planned in this fiscal year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. The cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the 13 Table of Contents cost of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if required. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements and are included in the Property and Equipment line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. These long lived assets are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we will periodically evaluate the historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. To the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, we must establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations. We have valuation allowances of $1.7 million as of January 31, 2002, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and capital loss carry forwards related to our prior investments in MXG Media, Inc. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions or realize off setting capital gains becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts valuation allowances if required. 14 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of the Companys net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2002 2001 2000 As a Percentage of Net Sales: Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distributionand occupancy costs 67.4 67.7 62.4 Gross profit 32.6 32.3 37.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 25.3 26.2 24.1 Income from operations 7.3 6.1 13.5 Other income (expense), net (0.1 ) (1.0 ) Income before income taxes 7.2 6.1 12.5 Income tax expense 2.9 2.5 5.8 Net income 4.3 % 3.6 % 6.7 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 18.2 % 6.2 % 32.5 % Gross profit 19.2 % (8.9 %) 32.8 % Income from operations 42.6 % (52.4 %) 49.6 % Net income 43.0 % (43.8 %) 18.5 % Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Net sales in fiscal 2002 increased by 18.2% to $349.0 million from $295.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The $53.7 million increase was attributable to a $56.0 million or 20.4% increase in retail segment sales, offset in part by a $2.3 million or 11.4% decline in Free Peoples wholesale sales, excluding sales to Urban Retail and Anthropologie. Noncomparable and new store net sales increases of $46.3 million, comparable store sales increases of $6.5 million or 2.8%, and direct to consumer sales increases of $3.2 million or 14.5% accounted for the retail segment increase. Comparable store sale increases were comprised of 0.5% for Urban Retail and 6.8% for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was caused by the opening of 12 new stores in fiscal 2002 and 11 new stores in fiscal 2001 (net of one store closing). Increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from a lower proportion of markdowns accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase in fiscal 2002. In addition, direct to consumer sales increased as a result of an increase in customer response rates to the Anthropologie catalog and web site and the Urban Retail web site. The decline in Free People wholesale sales in the first half of the year was due to a lackluster response to our spring and summer 2001 fashion offerings combined with production problems associated with a factory we no longer utilize. Additionally, a weaker wholesale market environment in the latter half of fiscal 2002 15 Table of Contents compared to fiscal 2001 resulted in decreased trade show attendance as well as a decline in our fall and holiday 2001 regular price merchandise reorders. The reduction in Free People in season wholesale sales was offset in part by an increase in off price sales to liquidate prior season merchandise. Gross profit margins increased to 32.6% of sales in fiscal 2002 compared to 32.3% of sales in fiscal 2001. Decreased markdowns in the retail segment were sufficient to offset the effects of an increase in occupancy costs of 1.0% of sales, arising primarily from noncomparable and new stores, and the reduction in Free Peoples gross margin of 0.8% of sales, caused by the off price liquidation of excess inventories. Total inventories at January 31, 2002 increased by 18.1%, including an increase in comparable store inventories of 9.3%, primarily due to an increase in the average cost per unit and an increase in the number of units per store to support sales trends. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.3% for fiscal 2002 versus 26.2% for fiscal 2001. An increase in direct to consumer response rates helped leverage catalog and web site production costs for direct to consumer marketing activities and was the primary reason for our operating expense percentage improvement of 0.9% of sales, despite an 8% decrease in catalog circulation during fiscal 2002. We also experienced comparable store efficiencies primarily related to the generation of incremental sales without incremental payroll costs that, when combined with the direct to consumer operating cost leveraging, more than offset the impact of the less efficient noncomparable and new stores. Accordingly, our operating margins increased to 7.3% of sales for fiscal 2002 compared to 6.1% of sales for fiscal 2001. Our goal is to improve operating margins to at least 10% of sales over time. Our effective tax rate decreased to 40.5% in fiscal 2002 from 41.0% in fiscal 2001 primarily due to a reduction in state and local tax rates. See Note 8 of Notes to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000 Net sales in fiscal 2001 increased by 6.2% to $295.3 million from $278.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The $17.2 million increase was primarily attributable to an $18.9 million or 7.4% increase in retail segment sales, offset in part by a $1.7 million or 7.7% decrease in Free Peoples wholesale sales, excluding sales to Urban Retail and Anthropologie. Noncomparable and new store net sales increased by $29.4 million. In addition, direct to consumer net sales increased by $4.7 million due to increased customer demand from the Anthropologie catalog and web site resulting from a 44% increase in catalog circulation and the introduction of the Urban Retail web site in 2001. These increases more than offset a decrease of $15.2 million or 7.4% in comparable store net sales, comprised of a 9.2% decrease for Urban Retail and a 3.1% decrease for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was caused by the opening of 11 new stores in fiscal 2001 (net of one store closing) and 12 new stores in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2001, we experienced a decrease in comparable store sales primarily as a result of a lackluster response to our product offerings. Consequently, we experienced lower average sales prices, primarily resulting from a higher proportion of markdowns. The Free People wholesale sales decrease was due to a reduction in purchases by certain catalog customers. Gross profit margins decreased to 32.3% of sales in fiscal 2001 from 37.6% of sales in fiscal 2000. Retail clearance markdowns to move seasonal merchandise reduced gross margins as a 16 Table of Contents percentage of sales by 2.4% for the year. The impact on occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to the negative comparable store sales results and increased percentage occupancy costs of noncomparable and new stores accounted for the majority of the remaining margin decline. Total inventories at January 31, 2001 increased by 29.5%, principally attributable to new store requirements. Comparable store inventory levels were flat. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 26.2% of sales in fiscal 2001 from 24.1% of sales in fiscal 2000 due principally to noncomparable and new stores with lower average sales volumes which, consequently, have higher proportionate expenses than comparable stores. The decrease in comparable store sales in fiscal 2001 also caused selling, general and administrative expenses for these stores to increase when measured as a percentage of sales. In addition, Anthropologie direct to consumer operations experienced an increase in operating expense percentages due to the deleveraging of catalog production costs caused by reduced customer response rates and increased catalog circulation. These increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were partially offset by a reduction in catalog fulfillment costs due to the elimination of third party service fulfillment providers in July 1999. We also incurred start up costs for the design, production and administration of the Urban Retail e commerce web site that was launched in May 2000. Other income (expense) for fiscal 2000 includes a net charge to earnings of $4.4 million to reserve for our portion of operating losses related to our minority investment in MXG Media, Inc. Income tax expense for fiscal 2000 does not include a tax benefit related to this reserve which, in part, has caused an increase in our effective income tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through cash flow from operations, accumulated cash and the sales of marketable securities. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores, purchase inventories and purchase our common shares. We have also continued to invest in direct to consumer efforts and in our United Kingdom and Ireland subsidiaries. In addition to the above sources of cash, sources of cash included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2000. We expect to incur additional capital expenditures in support of our store expansion program. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, assuming renewal or replacement, are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash for at least the next year. We entered into a new $25 million line of credit facility with one of our banks on September 12, 2001. This new credit facility, which replaced our former $16.2 million discretionary line of credit with the bank, is a one year committed line of credit to fund working capital requirements and letters of credit. The new line of credit contains sublimits for letters of credit and European subsidiary borrowings. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% to 1.75% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The agreement subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage, adjusted debt and minimum tangible net worth and limits our capital expenditures and share repurchases while prohibiting the payments of cash dividends on our common shares. At January 31, 2002, we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. There were no short term or long term borrowings 17 Table of Contents outstanding at January 31, 2002 or at January 31, 2001. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $9.4 million and $8.0 million at January 31, 2002 and January 31, 2001, respectively. We plan to renew the current line of credit on or before its expiration on September 11, 2002, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or replace the line of credit. Based on fiscal 2002 operating trends and the operating model that management has planned for fiscal 2003, we do not believe it will be necessary to borrow short term or long term funds. In the event, however, that there is a serious decline in sales for any reason or a significant increase in store expansion plans, we may be required to use our available line of credit for cash borrowings to fund operations. There can be no assurance that, based upon existing covenants or financial covenants contained in any renewed or replacement line of credit, that such borrowings would be available. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments: Contractual Obligations: Total Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years After Five Years Operating leases(1) $ 320,793 $ 35,696 $ 71,310 $ 64,841 $ 148,946 Capital leases(2) 678 183 440 55 Total contractual cash obligations $ 321,471 $ 35,879 $ 71,750 $ 64,896 $ 148,946 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. These obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. (2) At January 31, 2002, the Company had entered into a capital lease for computer equipment with a cost of approximately $660 which will be recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2003 upon receipt of the related equipment in accordance with the contract. Commercial Commitments(1): Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) Description Total Amounts Committed Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years After Five Years Lines of credit(2) $ 9,400 $ 9,400 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 163 163 Total commercial commitments $ 9,563 $ 9,563 $ $ $ (1) Excludes purchase orders for merchandise and supplies in the normal course of business which are liquidated within 12 months. (2) Consists solely of outstanding letter of credit commitments. 18 Table of Contents Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144), which establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and resolves significant implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121. SFAS No. 144 superceded SFAS No. 121 and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of a Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 on February 1, 2002 did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which was required to be adopted in fiscal 2002. We have a short term foreign currency forward exchange contract to manage exposures related to our Canadian dollar denominated investments and anticipated cash flow that we renew quarterly. The amounts of the contracts and related gains and losses have not been material. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on February 1, 2001 did not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. MXG Media, Inc. As of January 31, 2000, we had invested approximately $2.0 million in Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and $2.4 million in convertible debentures of MXG Media, Inc. (MXG). MXG incurred losses from its inception, and, in accordance with the equity method of accounting, we recorded charges to earnings of $4.4 million for our portion of operating losses related to the minority interest in MXG during fiscal 2000. These charges in fiscal 2000 fully reserved for our investment, and we made no additional investments in fiscal 2001 in MXG. On September 13, 2000, MXG ceased operations and filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. MXG had been unsuccessful in attempts to raise additional capital. We do not expect to recover any material portion of our investment in MXG. Forward Looking Statements This Securities and Exchange Commission filing is being made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain matters contained in this filing may constitute forward looking statements. When used in this Form 10 K, the words project, believe, anticipate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words. Any one, or all, of the following factors could cause actual financial results to differ materially from those financial results mentioned in the forward looking statements: the difficulty in predicting and responding to shifts in fashion trends, changes in the level of competitive pricing and promotional activity and other industry factors, overall economic and market conditions and the resultant impact on consumer spending patterns, including any effects of terrorist acts or war, availability of suitable retail space for expansion, timing of store openings, seasonal fluctuations in gross sales, the departure of one or more key senior managers, import risks, including potential disruptions and changes in duties, tariffs and quotas and other risks identified in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward looking statements even if experience 19 Table of Contents or future changes make it clear that actual results may differ materially from any projected results expressed or implied therein. Seasonality and Quarterly Results While we have been profitable in each of our last 48 operating quarters, our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the back to school and holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on our results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While our comparable store sales trend has thus far exceeded our low single digit plan, our results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year. Our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into our operations or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for our direct to consumer operations. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters. The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and income per share for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2002 Quarter Ended April 30, 2001 July 31, 2001 Oct. 31, 2001 Jan. 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sale $ 71,834 $ 80,395 $ 92,859 $ 103,870 Gross profit 21,560 25,944 31,244 34,899 Net income 1,151 3,157 4,928 5,771 Net income per share basic $ 0.07 $ 0.18 $ 0.29 $ 0.33 Net income per share diluted $ 0.07 $ 0.18 $ 0.28 $ 0.33 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 23 % 27 % 30 % Net income 8 % 21 % 33 % 38 % Fiscal 2001 Quarter Ended April 30, 2000 July 31, 2000 Oct. 31, 2000 Jan. 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 65,950 $ 66,728 $ 77,091 $ 85,564 Gross profit 23,266 19,847 24,534 27,684 Net income 2,990 1,737 2,361 3,407 Net income pre share basic $ 0.17 $ 0.10 $ 0.14 $ 0.20 Net income per share diluted $ 0.17 $ 0.10 $ 0.14 $ 0.20 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 23 % 26 % 29 % Net income 28 % 17 % 23 % 32 % 20 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turn and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. As explained in Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements, the market risk is further limited by the Companys purchase of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash and cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2002, the Companys cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate, and short term corporate demand notes. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. As the interest rates on predominantly all of our cash equivalents are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash and cash equivalents would impact interest income and expense along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.
