Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our historical results of operations and of our liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their related notes included elsewhere in this report. General Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2003 ended on January 31, 2003. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. We operate two business segments a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business. The retailing segment operates through retail stores and direct to consumer, including two catalogs and two web sites. The retail concepts are Urban Outfitters, which we refer to as Urban Retail, Anthropologie and Free People. Urban Retail had 53 stores open at January 31, 2003 and 49 at January 31, 2002. Anthropologie had 39 stores open at January 31, 2003 and 31 at January 31, 2002. Free People had one store open at January 31, 2003, which opened in November 2002. The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens casual apparel and sells worldwide through approximately 1,100 better department and specialty stores. We have plans to open approximately 20 to 24 stores during this fiscal year, primarily in our Urban Retail and Anthropologie concepts. Our goal thereafter is to increase net sales 20 to 25% per year through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. We have wholly owned subsidiaries that operate Urban Retail stores in London and Glasgow, in Dublin and in Montreal and Toronto. These stores are included in the store numbers given above. The results of operations and financial position for these stores are included in our retail operations segment results. We may open additional stores outside the United States over the next several fiscal years. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. 13 Table of Contents The Companys senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates and Managements Discussion and Analysis regarding them with its audit committee. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if required. Inventories as of January 31, 2003 and January 31, 2002 totaled $48.8 million and $41.1 million, respectively, representing approximately 17.6% and 21.1% of total assets, respectively. Any significant changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements and are included in the Property and Equipment line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. These long lived assets are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2003 and January 31, 2002 totaled $108.8 million and $105.5 million, respectively, representing 39.2% and 54.1% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate the historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of the Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, we had no write downs of long lived assets. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our 14 Table of Contents deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2003 and January 31, 2002 totaled approximately $12.7 million and $9.6 million, respectively, representing approximately 4.6% and 4.9% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery is at risk, we must establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We have valuation allowances of $1.7 million as of January 31, 2003 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards related to our prior investments in MXG Media, Inc. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions or to realize off setting capital gains becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts valuation allowances if required. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires Company management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 15 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of the Companys net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2003 2002 2001 As a Percentage of Net Sales: Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 64.3 67.4 67.7 Gross profit 35.7 32.6 32.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 25.0 25.3 26.2 Income from operations 10.7 7.3 6.1 Other income (expense), net 0.2 (0.1 ) Income before income taxes 10.9 7.2 6.1 Income tax expense 4.4 2.9 2.5 Net income 6.5 % 4.3 % 3.6 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 21.1 % 18.2 % 6.2 % Gross profit 32.7 % 19.2 % (8.9 %) Income from operations 78.0 % 42.6 % (52.4 %) Net income 82.7 % 43.0 % (43.8 %) Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net sales in fiscal 2003 increased by 21.1% to $422.8 million from $349.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The $73.8 million increase was primarily attributable to a $73.9 million, or 22.4%, increase in retail segment sales, offset in part by a slight decline in Free People wholesale sales of $0.1 million, excluding sales to Urban Retail, Anthropologie and Free People retail operations. Noncomparable and new store net sales increases of $41.3 million, comparable store net sales increases of $25.7 million or 9.1%, and direct to consumer net sales increases of $6.9 million or 27.9% accounted for the retail segment increase. Comparable store net sales were comprised of a 7.1% increase for Urban Retail and a 12.3% increase for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening 13 new stores in fiscal 2003 and 12 new stores in fiscal 2002. Comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales price resulting from higher initial markons and a lower proportion of markdowns, which more than offset a decrease in the number of items purchased per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in the average catalog and web order value and additional customer response related to an increase in catalog circulation for Anthropologie, including a new Summer Essentials catalog. The Urban Retail web site also contributed to the direct to consumer net sales increase as a result of increased site traffic and an improvement in average order value. 16 Table of Contents Gross profit margins increased to 35.7% of net sales in fiscal 2003 compared to 32.6% of net sales in fiscal 2002. Improvements to initial margins due to better sourcing and an increased proportion of private label merchandise, together with a reduction in markdown requirements, accounted for the majority of the increase. Total inventories at January 31, 2003 increased by 18.8% including an increase in comparable store inventories of 5.7%, primarily related to an increase in the number of units per store anticipated to support sales trends. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 25.0% of net sales for fiscal 2003 versus 25.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses and increased efficiencies in the direct to consumer operations. Accordingly, our operating margins increased to 10.7% of net sales for fiscal 2003 compared to 7.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002. Our effective tax rate of 40.5% remained the same for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Net sales in fiscal 2002 increased by 18.2% to $349.0 million from $295.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The $53.7 million increase was attributable to a $56.0 million, or 20.4%, increase in retail segment sales, offset in part by a $2.3 million, or 11.4%, decline in Free People wholesale sales, excluding sales to Urban Retail and Anthropologie. Noncomparable and new store net sales increases of $46.3 million, comparable store net sales increases of $6.5 million or 2.8%, and direct to consumer net sales increases of $3.2 million or 14.5% accounted for the retail segment increase. Comparable store net sales were comprised of a 0.5% increase for Urban Retail and a 6.8% increase for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening 12 new stores in fiscal 2002 and 11 new stores in fiscal 2001 (net of one store closing). Increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from a lower proportion of markdowns accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase in fiscal 2002. In addition, direct to consumer net sales increased as a result of an increase in customer response rates to the Anthropologie catalog and web site and the Urban Retail web site. The decline in Free People wholesale sales in the first half of the year was due to a lackluster response to our Spring and Summer 2001 fashion offerings combined with production problems associated with a factory we no longer utilize. Additionally, a weaker wholesale market environment in the latter half of fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 resulted in decreased trade show attendance as well as a decline in our Fall and Holiday 2001 regular price merchandise reorders. The reduction in Free People in season wholesale sales was offset in part by an increase in off price sales to liquidate prior season merchandise. Gross profit margins increased to 32.6% of net sales in fiscal 2002 compared to 32.3% of net sales in fiscal 2001. Decreased markdowns in the retail segment were sufficient to offset the effects of an increase in occupancy costs of 1.0% of net sales, arising primarily from noncomparable and new stores, and the impact of the reduction in Free Peoples gross margin of 0.8% of net sales, caused by the off price liquidation of excess inventories. Total inventories at January 31, 2002 increased by 17 Table of Contents 18.1%, including an increase in comparable store inventories of 9.3%, primarily due to an increase in the average cost per unit and an increase in the number of units per store to support sales trends. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 25.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002 versus 26.2% of net sales for fiscal 2001. An increase in direct to consumer response rates helped leverage catalog and web site production costs for direct to consumer marketing activities and was the primary reason for our operating expense percentage improvement of 0.9% of net sales, despite an 8% decrease in catalog circulation during fiscal 2002. We also experienced comparable store efficiencies primarily related to the generation of incremental sales without incremental payroll costs that, when combined with the direct to consumer operating cost leveraging, more than offset the impact of the less efficient noncomparable and new stores. Accordingly, our operating margins increased to 7.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002 compared to 6.1% of net sales for fiscal 2001. Our effective tax rate decreased to 40.5% in fiscal 2002 from 41.0% in fiscal 2001 primarily due to a reduction in state and local tax rates. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources In April 2002, we completed a public offering of 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $28.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $41.5 million from the offering. In conjunction with the offering, certain selling shareholders exercised options which resulted in additional cash proceeds of approximately $1.5 million. In addition to this and other sources of cash, we received net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 of approximately $4.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. During the last three years, in addition to the proceeds generated from the public offering of our common shares and the exercise of certain employee stock options, we have also satisfied our cash requirements through cash flow from operations, accumulated cash and the sales of marketable securities. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in direct to consumer efforts and in our United Kingdom and Ireland subsidiaries. We expect to increase the level of capital expenditures in support of our goal of expanding the store base by approximately 20% per annum. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, assuming renewal or replacement, are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash at least through fiscal 2005. On September 11, 2002, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility with one of our banks. This credit facility, which renewed and amended our $25.0 million committed line of credit with the bank, is a one year $30.0 million committed line of credit to fund working capital requirements and letters of credit. The credit facility was further amended on November 15, 2002 to add another bank as a lender under the credit facility. The credit facility contains a sublimit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries and is guaranteed by us, as defined in the credit facility. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% to 1.75% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The agreement subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage, adjusted debt and minimum 18 Table of Contents tangible net worth and limits our capital expenditures and share repurchases, while prohibiting the payment of cash dividends on our common shares. At January 31, 2003, we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. There were no short term or long term borrowings outstanding at January 31, 2003 or at January 31, 2002. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $13.3 million and $9.4 million at January 31, 2003 and January 31, 2002, respectively. The available line of credit under the credit facility was $16.7 million and $15.6 million at January 31, 2003 and January 31, 2002, respectively. We plan to renew the current line of credit on or before its expiration on September 11, 2003, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or replace the line of credit. Based on fiscal 2004 operating trends and the operating model that management has planned for fiscal 2005, we do not believe it will be necessary to borrow short term or long term funds. In the event, however, that there is a serious decline in sales for any reason or a significant increase in store expansion plans, we may be required to use our available line of credit for cash borrowings to fund operations. There can be no assurance that, based upon existing covenants or financial covenants contained in any renewed or replacement line of credit, that such borrowings would be available. In January 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorized the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 of its shares. As of January 31, 2003, 872,500 shares are authorized for repurchase. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, assuming renewal or replacement, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments: Contractual Obligations: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description Total Obligations Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years After Five Years Operating leases (1) $ 331,031 $ 38,440 $ 75,433 $ 68,038 $ 149,120 Capital leases (2) 471 200 271 Total contractual cash obligations $ 331,502 $ 38,640 $ 75,704 $ 68,038 $ 149,120 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. These obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Amounts noted above include commitments for seven executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2003. (2) At January 31, 2002, the Company entered into a capital lease for computer equipment with a cost of approximately $609 which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 upon receipt of the related equipment in accordance with the contract. The lease provides for the payment of interest as well as principal. 19 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments (1): Amount of Commitment Per Period (in thousands) Description Total Amounts Committed Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years After Five Years Lines of credit (2) $ 13,268 $ 13,268 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 103 103 Total commercial commitments $ 13,371 $ 13,371 $ $ $ (1) Excludes purchase orders for merchandise and supplies in the normal course of business which are liquidated within 12 months. (2) Consists solely of outstanding letter of credit commitments. Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Disclosure requirements for interim financial statements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002, although early adoption was encouraged. We have not completed our evaluation of the alternative methods of transition, and thus have not yet made a determination on whether we will adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the transition guidance of SFAS No. 148. As such, we are not yet able to determine what impact, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. EITF Issue No. 02 16 provides guidance as to how customers should account for cash consideration received from a vendor. EITF Issue No. 02 16 presumes that cash received from a vendor represents a reduction of the prices of the vendors products or services, unless the cash received represents a payment for assets or services provided to the vendor or a reimbursement of costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendors products. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 02 16 will apply to all agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the provisions of EITF Issue No. 02 16 to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 supercedes EITF Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), and is effective for transactions initiated after December 31, 2002. Under SFAS No. 146, we would record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 20 Table of Contents when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value. A liability is incurred when an event obligates the entity to transfer or use assets. We do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13 to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions. The provisions of the statement related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 are applied in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Earlier application of these provisions was encouraged. The provision of SFAS No. 145 related to SFAS No. 13 was effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and resolves significant implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121. SFAS No. 144 superceded SFAS No. 121 and portions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of a Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 on February 1, 2002 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires a company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and or normal use of the assets. A corresponding asset would also be recorded, that is depreciated over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 143 on February 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Forward Looking Statements This Securities and Exchange Commission filing is being made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain matters contained in this filing may constitute forward looking statements. When used in this Form 10 K, the words project, believe, anticipate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words. Any one, or all, of the following factors could cause actual financial results to differ materially from those financial results mentioned in the forward looking statements: the difficulty in predicting and responding to shifts in fashion trends, changes in the level of competitive pricing and promotional activity and other industry factors, overall economic and market conditions and the resultant impact on consumer spending patterns, any effects of terrorist acts or war, availability of suitable retail space for expansion, timing of store openings, seasonal fluctuations in gross sales, the departure of one or more key senior managers, import risks, including potential disruptions and changes in duties, tariffs and quotas and 21 Table of Contents other risks identified in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that actual results may differ materially from any projected results expressed or implied therein. Seasonality and Quarterly Results While we have been profitable in each of our last 52 operating quarters, our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the back to school and holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on our results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into our operations or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for our direct to consumer operations. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters. The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2003 Quarter Ended April 30, 2002 July 31, 2002 Oct. 31, 2002 Jan. 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 94,074 $ 101,001 $ 110,106 $ 117,573 Gross profit 32,170 35,757 39,174 43,690 Net income 4,755 6,255 8,026 8,377 Net income per common share basic 0.27 0.33 0.42 0.43 Net income per common share diluted 0.26 0.32 0.41 0.42 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 24 % 26 % 28 % Net income 17 % 23 % 29 % 31 % Fiscal 2002 Quarter Ended April 30, 2001 July 31, 2001 Oct. 31, 2001 Jan. 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 71,834 $ 80,395 $ 92,859 $ 103,870 Gross profit 21,560 25,944 31,244 34,899 Net income 1,151 3,157 4,928 5,771 Net income per common share basic 0.07 0.18 0.29 0.33 Net income per common share diluted 0.07 0.18 0.28 0.33 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 23 % 27 % 30 % Net income 8 % 21 % 33 % 38 % 22 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turn and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2003 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate, auction rate preferred stock rated AA or better and tax exempt municipal bonds rated AA or better, which bear interest at a fixed rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income and expense along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.
