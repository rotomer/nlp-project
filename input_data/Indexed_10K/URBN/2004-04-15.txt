Overview We operate two business segments, a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People stores. In addition, Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie offer merchandise through our direct to consumer operations, which consist of a catalog and web site for each of these brands. Our wholesale segment consists of our Free People wholesale division. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2004 ended on January 31, 2004. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2004, we operated 61 Urban Outfitters stores (Urban Retail) of which 55 were located in the United States, 2 in Canada, 2 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Scotland and 1 in Ireland. During fiscal 2004 we opened eight new Urban Retail stores, all of which are located within the United States except for one store, which we opened in London. Urban Retail targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Retails North American and European store sales, accounted for approximately 46% and 3% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2004. We operated 52 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2004, all of which were located in the United States. During fiscal 2004 we opened 13 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its 14 Table of Contents merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 39% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. Our Free People retail store is located in Paramus, New Jersey and primarily offers Free People branded womens merchandise targeted to young contemporary women. We plan to open a limited number of additional stores over the next several fiscal years, including one to two stores in fiscal 2005. Free Peoples sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. We plan to open approximately 24 to 27 stores during fiscal 2005, including one to two new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Retail and Anthropologie. Our goal thereafter is to increase net sales 20 to 25% per year through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Direct to consumer In March 1998, Anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2004, Anthropologie catalog circulation was over 13.3 million. Furthermore, we believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to expand circulation to more than 15.0 million catalogs during fiscal 2005 and continue to modestly increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Anthropologie operates an Internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.anthropologie.com, debuted in December 1998. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. The circulation of the catalog exceeded three million during fiscal 2004. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. Based on an overwhelmingly positive customer response to the catalog, we plan to expand circulation to approximately eight million catalogs in fiscal 2005. Urban Outfitters also operates an Internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.urbn.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the store. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. We plan to test a new Free People web site during the second half of fiscal 2005. We believe this site will further expose consumers to our Free People product assortment. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Our range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through 15 Table of Contents approximately 1,100 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Marshall Fields, Macy*s West, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People store. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Payment for merchandise at our stores, and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card, therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption for merchandise. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and merchandise currently priced 16 Table of Contents below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if required. Inventories as of January 31, 2004 and January 31, 2003 totaled $63.2 million and $50.0 million, respectively, representing 17.6% and 17.9% of total assets. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements as well as furniture and fixtures and are included in the Property and Equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2004 and January 31, 2003 totaled $121.9 million and $108.8 million, respectively, representing 33.9% and 39.0% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of the Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we had no write downs of long lived assets. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. We determine our provision for income taxes based on tax legislation currently in effect. Legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate, if enacted, could increase the transactions or activities subject to tax. Any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our income tax expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2004 and January 31, 2003 totaled $13.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively, representing 3.8% and 4.5% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery is at risk, we must establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations. 17 Table of Contents We have valuation allowances of $2.1 million as of January 31, 2004 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions or to realize off setting capital gains becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances if required. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2004 2003 2002 As a Percentage of Net Sales: Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 61.1 64.3 67.4 Gross profit 38.9 35.7 32.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 24.2 25.0 25.3 Income from operations 14.7 10.7 7.3 Other income (expense), net 0.1 0.2 (0.1 ) Income before income taxes 14.8 10.9 7.2 Income tax expense 6.0 4.4 2.9 Net income 8.8 % 6.5 % 4.3 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 29.7 % 21.1 % 18.2 % Gross profit 41.6 % 32.7 % 19.2 % Income from operations 77.8 % 78.0 % 42.6 % Net income 76.5 % 82.7 % 43.0 % Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net sales in fiscal 2004 increased by 29.7% to $548.4 million from $422.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The $125.6 million increase was primarily attributable to a $126.1 million, or 31.2% increase, in retail segment sales, offset in part by a slight decline in Free People wholesale sales of $0.5 million, excluding sales to Urban Retail, Anthropologie and Free People retail operations. The growth in our retail segment during fiscal 2004 was driven by a $61.6 million increase in noncomparable and new store net sales, a $45.1 million or 12.9% increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $19.4 million or 61.1%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 13.1% increase for Urban Retail and a 12.6% increase for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening 21 new stores in fiscal 2004 and 13 new stores in fiscal 2003 that are considered noncomparable during fiscal 2004. Comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales prices resulting from higher initial markons and a lower proportion of markdowns. Comparable store sales continue to significantly exceed our plan, thus far during fiscal 2005. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the initial circulation of three million new Urban Outfitters catalogs and increased traffic to the Urban Outfitters web site. Anthropologie also contributed to the 19 Table of Contents direct to consumer net sales growth by increasing circulation of the Anthropologie catalog to approximately 13.3 million catalogs, including a new Winter Essentials catalog, increased traffic to the Anthropologie web site, and an improvement in the average order value. Gross profit margins increased to 38.9% of net sales in fiscal 2004 compared to 35.7% of net sales in fiscal 2003. Improvements to initial margins due to better sourcing and a reduction in markdown requirements accounted for the majority of the increase. Total inventories at January 31, 2004 increased by 29.5%, including an increase in comparable store inventories of 0.3%, primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. We anticipate making similar investments in connection with new store openings in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.2% of net sales for fiscal 2004 versus 25.0% of net sales for fiscal 2003. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Accordingly, our operating margins increased to 14.7% of net sales for fiscal 2004 compared to 10.7% of net sales for fiscal 2003. Our effective tax rate of 40.5% remained the same for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net sales in fiscal 2003 increased by 21.1% to $422.8 million from $349.0 million in fiscal 2002. The $73.8 million increase was primarily attributable to a $73.9 million, or 22.4% increase, in retail segment sales, offset in part by a slight decline in Free People wholesale sales of $0.1 million, excluding sales to Urban Retail, Anthropologie and Free People retail operations. Noncomparable and new store net sales increases of $41.3 million, comparable store net sales increases of $25.7 million or 9.1%, and direct to consumer net sales increases of $6.9 million or 27.9% accounted for the retail segment increase. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 7.1% increase for Urban Retail and a 12.3% increase for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening 13 new stores in fiscal 2003 and 12 new stores in fiscal 2002 that are considered noncomparable in fiscal 2003. Comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales price resulting from higher initial markons and a lower proportion of markdowns, which more than offset a decrease in the number of items purchased per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in the average catalog and web order value and additional customer response related to an increase in catalog circulation for Anthropologie, including a new Summer Essentials catalog. The Urban Retail web site also contributed to the direct to consumer net sales increase as a result of increased site traffic and an improvement in average order value. Gross profit margins increased to 35.7% of net sales in fiscal 2003 compared to 32.6% of net sales in fiscal 2002. Improvements to initial margins due to better sourcing and an increased proportion of private label merchandise, together with a reduction in markdown requirements, 20 Table of Contents accounted for the majority of the increase. Total inventories at January 31, 2003 increased by 18.8% including an increase in comparable store inventories of 5.7%, primarily related to an increase in the number of units per store anticipated to support sales trends. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 25.0% of net sales for fiscal 2003 versus 25.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses and increased efficiencies in the direct to consumer operations. Accordingly, our operating margins increased to 10.7% of net sales for fiscal 2003 compared to 7.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002. Our effective tax rate of 40.5% remained the same for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $139.5 million as of January 31, 2004 as compared to $95.1 million as of January 31, 2003 and $28.3 million as of January 31, 2002. Increases in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities since January 31, 2003 were primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities. In April 2002, we completed a public offering of 3.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $14.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $41.5 million from the offering. In conjunction with the offering, certain selling shareholders exercised options, which resulted in additional cash proceeds of approximately $1.5 million. During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations and the proceeds generated from the public offering of our common shares. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts and in our United Kingdom and Ireland subsidiaries. We expect to increase the level of capital expenditures in support of our goal of expanding our store base by approximately 20% per annum. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, assuming renewal or replacement, are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash at least through fiscal 2007. On September 9, 2003, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility (the Line). The Line is a one year $30.0 million committed line of credit to fund working capital requirements and letters of credit. The Line contains a sublimit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% to 1.75% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage, adjusted debt and minimum tangible net worth, limits capital expenditures and share repurchase and prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common shares. As of January 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of and during the twelve months ended January 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under 21 Table of Contents the Line totaled approximately $14.6 million as of January 31, 2004. The available borrowing under the Line was $15.4 million as of January 31, 2004. Based on fiscal 2004 operating trends and the operating model that management has planned for fiscal 2005, we do not believe it will be necessary to borrow short term or long term funds during fiscal 2005. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, assuming renewal or replacement, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments: Contractual Obligations (1) Description TotalObligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More than Five Years Operating leases (2) $ 407,801 $ 46,732 $ 94,169 $ 86,199 $ 180,701 Capital lease (3) 271 211 60 Total contractual obligations $ 408,072 $ 46,943 $ 94,229 $ 86,199 $ 180,701 (1) Excludes purchase orders for merchandise and supplies in the normal course of business, which are liquidated within 12 months. (2) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are seven locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected. Total rent expense related to these seven locations was approximately $942,000 for fiscal 2004. The Urban Outfitters at Covent Gardens (London, UK) has rent defined for only five years, although the lease is for a period of 15 years, with minimum rent subject to review every five years. Included in the table above is an estimate of our rent obligation on this property for the remaining 10 years of the lease based upon our rent obligation for the first 5 years. Amounts noted above include commitments for 19 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2004. (3) As of January 31, 2002, the Company entered into a capital lease for computer equipment with a cost of approximately $609,000, which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 upon receipt of the related equipment in accordance with the contract. The lease provides for the payment of interest as well as principal. 22 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description Total Amounts Committed Amount of Commitment Per Period (in thousands) Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More Than Five Years Line of credit (1) $ 14,577 $ 14,577 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 20 20 Total commercial commitments $ 14,597 $ 14,597 $ $ $ (1) Consists solely of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2004, we were not party to any off balance sheet arrangements. Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. It establishes classification and measurement standards for three types of freestanding financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 150 must be classified as liabilities within our Consolidated Financial Statements and be reported at settlement date value. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 are effective for (i) instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and (ii) pre existing instruments as of July 1, 2003. In November 2003, through the issuance of FASB Staff Position 150 3 (FSP 150 3), the FASB indefinitely deferred the effective date of certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. The adoption of SFAS No. 150, as modified by FSP 150 3, had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative as discussed in SFAS No. 133. It also specifies when a derivative contains a financing component that requires special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 amends certain other existing pronouncements in order to improve consistency in reporting these types of transactions. The new guidance is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. SFAS No. 149 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities, which are entities that either (a) do not have equity investors with vesting rights or (b) have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. The interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after February 1, 2003. In 23 Table of Contents December 2003, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R, among other things, defers the effective date of implementation for certain entities. The revised interpretation is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities, for which the statement is effective for periods ending after December 15, 2003. The Company does not have any interest in any entity that requires disclosure or consolidation as a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 46. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We have adopted the quarterly disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148; however, we continue to account for our stock based compensation based upon the guidance of SFAS No. 123, which allows us to measure stock based compensation using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We will continue to consider alternative methods as future pronouncements are issued by the FASB. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of FIN 45 are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Companys adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Seasonality and Quarterly Results While we have been profitable in each of our last 56 operating quarters, our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the back to school and holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on our results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into our operations or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for our direct to consumer operations. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters. 24 Table of Contents The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2004 Quarter Ended April 30,2003 July 31,2003 Oct. 31,2003 Jan. 31,2004 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 107,028 $ 122,879 $ 142,331 $ 176,123 Gross profit 37,933 45,648 56,811 73,081 Net income 6,393 9,467 14,087 18,429 Net income per common share basic 0.17 0.24 0.36 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.16 0.24 0.35 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 22 % 26 % 32 % Net income 13 % 20 % 29 % 38 % Fiscal 2003 Quarter Ended April 30,2002 July 31,2002 Oct. 31,2002 Jan. 31,2003 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 94,074 $ 101,001 $ 110,106 $ 117,573 Gross profit 32,170 35,757 39,174 43,690 Net income 4,755 6,255 8,026 8,377 Net income per common share basic 0.14 0.16 0.21 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.13 0.16 0.20 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 24 % 26 % 28 % Net income 17 % 23 % 29 % 31 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2004, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated AA or better, auction rate instruments rated AA or better and money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash 25 Table of Contents equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.

When used in this Form 10 K, the words project, believe, anticipate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words. Any one, or all, of the following factors could cause actual financial results to differ materially from those financial results mentioned in the forward looking statements: the difficulty in predicting and responding to shifts in fashion trends, changes in the level of competitive pricing and promotional activity and other industry factors, overall economic and market conditions and the resultant impact on consumer spending patterns, any effects of terrorist acts or war, availability of suitable retail space for expansion, timing of store openings, seasonal fluctuations in gross sales, the departure of one or more key senior managers, import risks, including potential disruptions and changes in duties, tariffs and quotas and other risks identified in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any intent or obligation to update forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that actual results may differ materially from any projected results expressed or implied therein. Overview We operate two business segments, a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People stores. In addition, Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie offer merchandise through our direct to consumer operations, which consist of a catalog and web site for each of these brands. Our wholesale segment consists of our Free People wholesale division. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2004 ended on January 31, 2004. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2004, we operated 61 Urban Outfitters stores (Urban Retail) of which 55 were located in the United States, 2 in Canada, 2 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Scotland and 1 in Ireland. During fiscal 2004 we opened eight new Urban Retail stores, all of which are located within the United States except for one store, which we opened in London. Urban Retail targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Retails North American and European store sales, accounted for approximately 46% and 3% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2004. We operated 52 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2004, all of which were located in the United States. During fiscal 2004 we opened 13 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its 14 Table of Contents merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 39% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. Our Free People retail store is located in Paramus, New Jersey and primarily offers Free People branded womens merchandise targeted to young contemporary women. We plan to open a limited number of additional stores over the next several fiscal years, including one to two stores in fiscal 2005. Free Peoples sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. We plan to open approximately 24 to 27 stores during fiscal 2005, including one to two new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Retail and Anthropologie. Our goal thereafter is to increase net sales 20 to 25% per year through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Direct to consumer In March 1998, Anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2004, Anthropologie catalog circulation was over 13.3 million. Furthermore, we believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to expand circulation to more than 15.0 million catalogs during fiscal 2005 and continue to modestly increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Anthropologie operates an Internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.anthropologie.com, debuted in December 1998. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. The circulation of the catalog exceeded three million during fiscal 2004. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. Based on an overwhelmingly positive customer response to the catalog, we plan to expand circulation to approximately eight million catalogs in fiscal 2005. Urban Outfitters also operates an Internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.urbn.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the store. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. We plan to test a new Free People web site during the second half of fiscal 2005. We believe this site will further expose consumers to our Free People product assortment. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Our range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through 15 Table of Contents approximately 1,100 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Marshall Fields, Macy*s West, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People store. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2004. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Payment for merchandise at our stores, and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card, therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption for merchandise. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and merchandise currently priced 16 Table of Contents below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if required. Inventories as of January 31, 2004 and January 31, 2003 totaled $63.2 million and $50.0 million, respectively, representing 17.6% and 17.9% of total assets. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements as well as furniture and fixtures and are included in the Property and Equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2004 and January 31, 2003 totaled $121.9 million and $108.8 million, respectively, representing 33.9% and 39.0% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of the Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we had no write downs of long lived assets. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. We determine our provision for income taxes based on tax legislation currently in effect. Legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate, if enacted, could increase the transactions or activities subject to tax. Any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our income tax expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2004 and January 31, 2003 totaled $13.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively, representing 3.8% and 4.5% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery is at risk, we must establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations. 17 Table of Contents We have valuation allowances of $2.1 million as of January 31, 2004 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions or to realize off setting capital gains becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances if required. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2004 2003 2002 As a Percentage of Net Sales: Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 61.1 64.3 67.4 Gross profit 38.9 35.7 32.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 24.2 25.0 25.3 Income from operations 14.7 10.7 7.3 Other income (expense), net 0.1 0.2 (0.1 ) Income before income taxes 14.8 10.9 7.2 Income tax expense 6.0 4.4 2.9 Net income 8.8 % 6.5 % 4.3 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 29.7 % 21.1 % 18.2 % Gross profit 41.6 % 32.7 % 19.2 % Income from operations 77.8 % 78.0 % 42.6 % Net income 76.5 % 82.7 % 43.0 % Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net sales in fiscal 2004 increased by 29.7% to $548.4 million from $422.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The $125.6 million increase was primarily attributable to a $126.1 million, or 31.2% increase, in retail segment sales, offset in part by a slight decline in Free People wholesale sales of $0.5 million, excluding sales to Urban Retail, Anthropologie and Free People retail operations. The growth in our retail segment during fiscal 2004 was driven by a $61.6 million increase in noncomparable and new store net sales, a $45.1 million or 12.9% increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $19.4 million or 61.1%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 13.1% increase for Urban Retail and a 12.6% increase for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening 21 new stores in fiscal 2004 and 13 new stores in fiscal 2003 that are considered noncomparable during fiscal 2004. Comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales prices resulting from higher initial markons and a lower proportion of markdowns. Comparable store sales continue to significantly exceed our plan, thus far during fiscal 2005. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the initial circulation of three million new Urban Outfitters catalogs and increased traffic to the Urban Outfitters web site. Anthropologie also contributed to the 19 Table of Contents direct to consumer net sales growth by increasing circulation of the Anthropologie catalog to approximately 13.3 million catalogs, including a new Winter Essentials catalog, increased traffic to the Anthropologie web site, and an improvement in the average order value. Gross profit margins increased to 38.9% of net sales in fiscal 2004 compared to 35.7% of net sales in fiscal 2003. Improvements to initial margins due to better sourcing and a reduction in markdown requirements accounted for the majority of the increase. Total inventories at January 31, 2004 increased by 29.5%, including an increase in comparable store inventories of 0.3%, primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. We anticipate making similar investments in connection with new store openings in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.2% of net sales for fiscal 2004 versus 25.0% of net sales for fiscal 2003. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Accordingly, our operating margins increased to 14.7% of net sales for fiscal 2004 compared to 10.7% of net sales for fiscal 2003. Our effective tax rate of 40.5% remained the same for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net sales in fiscal 2003 increased by 21.1% to $422.8 million from $349.0 million in fiscal 2002. The $73.8 million increase was primarily attributable to a $73.9 million, or 22.4% increase, in retail segment sales, offset in part by a slight decline in Free People wholesale sales of $0.1 million, excluding sales to Urban Retail, Anthropologie and Free People retail operations. Noncomparable and new store net sales increases of $41.3 million, comparable store net sales increases of $25.7 million or 9.1%, and direct to consumer net sales increases of $6.9 million or 27.9% accounted for the retail segment increase. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 7.1% increase for Urban Retail and a 12.3% increase for Anthropologie. The increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening 13 new stores in fiscal 2003 and 12 new stores in fiscal 2002 that are considered noncomparable in fiscal 2003. Comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales price resulting from higher initial markons and a lower proportion of markdowns, which more than offset a decrease in the number of items purchased per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in the average catalog and web order value and additional customer response related to an increase in catalog circulation for Anthropologie, including a new Summer Essentials catalog. The Urban Retail web site also contributed to the direct to consumer net sales increase as a result of increased site traffic and an improvement in average order value. Gross profit margins increased to 35.7% of net sales in fiscal 2003 compared to 32.6% of net sales in fiscal 2002. Improvements to initial margins due to better sourcing and an increased proportion of private label merchandise, together with a reduction in markdown requirements, 20 Table of Contents accounted for the majority of the increase. Total inventories at January 31, 2003 increased by 18.8% including an increase in comparable store inventories of 5.7%, primarily related to an increase in the number of units per store anticipated to support sales trends. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 25.0% of net sales for fiscal 2003 versus 25.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses and increased efficiencies in the direct to consumer operations. Accordingly, our operating margins increased to 10.7% of net sales for fiscal 2003 compared to 7.3% of net sales for fiscal 2002. Our effective tax rate of 40.5% remained the same for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $139.5 million as of January 31, 2004 as compared to $95.1 million as of January 31, 2003 and $28.3 million as of January 31, 2002. Increases in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities since January 31, 2003 were primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities. In April 2002, we completed a public offering of 3.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $14.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $41.5 million from the offering. In conjunction with the offering, certain selling shareholders exercised options, which resulted in additional cash proceeds of approximately $1.5 million. During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations and the proceeds generated from the public offering of our common shares. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts and in our United Kingdom and Ireland subsidiaries. We expect to increase the level of capital expenditures in support of our goal of expanding our store base by approximately 20% per annum. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, assuming renewal or replacement, are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash at least through fiscal 2007. On September 9, 2003, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility (the Line). The Line is a one year $30.0 million committed line of credit to fund working capital requirements and letters of credit. The Line contains a sublimit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% to 1.75% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage, adjusted debt and minimum tangible net worth, limits capital expenditures and share repurchase and prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common shares. As of January 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of and during the twelve months ended January 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under 21 Table of Contents the Line totaled approximately $14.6 million as of January 31, 2004. The available borrowing under the Line was $15.4 million as of January 31, 2004. Based on fiscal 2004 operating trends and the operating model that management has planned for fiscal 2005, we do not believe it will be necessary to borrow short term or long term funds during fiscal 2005. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, assuming renewal or replacement, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments: Contractual Obligations (1) Description TotalObligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More than Five Years Operating leases (2) $ 407,801 $ 46,732 $ 94,169 $ 86,199 $ 180,701 Capital lease (3) 271 211 60 Total contractual obligations $ 408,072 $ 46,943 $ 94,229 $ 86,199 $ 180,701 (1) Excludes purchase orders for merchandise and supplies in the normal course of business, which are liquidated within 12 months. (2) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are seven locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected. Total rent expense related to these seven locations was approximately $942,000 for fiscal 2004. The Urban Outfitters at Covent Gardens (London, UK) has rent defined for only five years, although the lease is for a period of 15 years, with minimum rent subject to review every five years. Included in the table above is an estimate of our rent obligation on this property for the remaining 10 years of the lease based upon our rent obligation for the first 5 years. Amounts noted above include commitments for 19 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2004. (3) As of January 31, 2002, the Company entered into a capital lease for computer equipment with a cost of approximately $609,000, which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 upon receipt of the related equipment in accordance with the contract. The lease provides for the payment of interest as well as principal. 22 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description Total Amounts Committed Amount of Commitment Per Period (in thousands) Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More Than Five Years Line of credit (1) $ 14,577 $ 14,577 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 20 20 Total commercial commitments $ 14,597 $ 14,597 $ $ $ (1) Consists solely of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2004, we were not party to any off balance sheet arrangements. Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. It establishes classification and measurement standards for three types of freestanding financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 150 must be classified as liabilities within our Consolidated Financial Statements and be reported at settlement date value. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 are effective for (i) instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and (ii) pre existing instruments as of July 1, 2003. In November 2003, through the issuance of FASB Staff Position 150 3 (FSP 150 3), the FASB indefinitely deferred the effective date of certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. The adoption of SFAS No. 150, as modified by FSP 150 3, had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative as discussed in SFAS No. 133. It also specifies when a derivative contains a financing component that requires special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 amends certain other existing pronouncements in order to improve consistency in reporting these types of transactions. The new guidance is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. SFAS No. 149 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities, which are entities that either (a) do not have equity investors with vesting rights or (b) have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. The interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after February 1, 2003. In 23 Table of Contents December 2003, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). FIN 46R, among other things, defers the effective date of implementation for certain entities. The revised interpretation is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities, for which the statement is effective for periods ending after December 15, 2003. The Company does not have any interest in any entity that requires disclosure or consolidation as a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 46. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We have adopted the quarterly disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148; however, we continue to account for our stock based compensation based upon the guidance of SFAS No. 123, which allows us to measure stock based compensation using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We will continue to consider alternative methods as future pronouncements are issued by the FASB. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of FIN 45 are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Companys adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Seasonality and Quarterly Results While we have been profitable in each of our last 56 operating quarters, our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the back to school and holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on our results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into our operations or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for our direct to consumer operations. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters. 24 Table of Contents The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2004 Quarter Ended April 30,2003 July 31,2003 Oct. 31,2003 Jan. 31,2004 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 107,028 $ 122,879 $ 142,331 $ 176,123 Gross profit 37,933 45,648 56,811 73,081 Net income 6,393 9,467 14,087 18,429 Net income per common share basic 0.17 0.24 0.36 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.16 0.24 0.35 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 22 % 26 % 32 % Net income 13 % 20 % 29 % 38 % Fiscal 2003 Quarter Ended April 30,2002 July 31,2002 Oct. 31,2002 Jan. 31,2003 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 94,074 $ 101,001 $ 110,106 $ 117,573 Gross profit 32,170 35,757 39,174 43,690 Net income 4,755 6,255 8,026 8,377 Net income per common share basic 0.14 0.16 0.21 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.13 0.16 0.20 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 24 % 26 % 28 % Net income 17 % 23 % 29 % 31 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2004, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated AA or better, auction rate instruments rated AA or better and money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash 25 Table of Contents equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.
