Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments, a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People stores and our direct to consumer operations, which consist of a catalog and web site for each of these brands. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2006, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and internet sales, are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, correlate to changes in customer traffic. We believe this may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, additional circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base, including expansion into enclosed malls and specialty retail centers. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2006 ended on January 31, 2006. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. We plan to grow our store base by approximately 20% per year. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2006, we operated 90 Urban Outfitters stores of which 80 are located in the United States, three in Canada and seven in Europe. During fiscal 2006, we opened 15 new Urban Outfitters stores, twelve of which are located within the United States, one store which we opened in Canada and two of which we opened in the United Kingdom. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Retails North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 42% and 4% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2006. We operated 79 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2006, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2006 we opened 14 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 36% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. 17 Table of Contents We operated six Free People stores as of January 31, 2006, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2006 we opened four new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several fiscal years. Free Peoples retail sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 35 to 38 stores during fiscal 2007, including three to five new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Our goal thereafter is to increase net sales by at least 20% per year through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Direct to consumer In March 1998, Anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2006, we circulated over 19 million catalogs and believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 21 million catalogs during fiscal 2007 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Anthropologie operates an Internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.anthropologie.com, debuted in December 1998. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. In fiscal 2006, we circulated approximately 11 million Urban Outfitters catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 14 million catalogs in fiscal 2007. Urban Outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the store. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. We successfully launched the Free People web site in September 2004. The web site, www.freepeople.com, offers consumers the entire Free People product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. In October 2005, Free People introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Free People stores. In fiscal 2006, we circulated approximately 2 million Free People catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 5 million catalogs in fiscal 2007. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 12% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. 18 Table of Contents Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Our range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately 1,500 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Marshall Fields, Macy*s West, Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Payment for merchandise at our stores, and through our direct to consumer business, is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially different than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2006 and 2005, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $6.4 million and $4.5 million, representing 3.1% and 2.9% of total liabilities, respectively. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost 19 Table of Contents of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories, such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. Criteria we use to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value, if required. Inventories as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 totaled $140.4 million and $99.0 million, representing 18.2% and 17.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Our reserves related to adjusting the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on recent historical trends. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, as well as furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 totaled $299.3 million and $192.8 million, respectively, representing 38.9% and 34.6% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of the Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, write downs of long lived assets were immaterial. We have only closed three store locations in our history, which in all cases took place at the expiration of the lease and renewal terms. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. 20 Table of Contents As of January 31, 2006, all of our stores opened in excess of three years are generating positive cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 totaled $23.9 million and $16.7 million, respectively, representing 3.1% and 3.0% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we must establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We had valuation allowances of $3.1 million as of January 31, 2006 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances if appropriate. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 58.9 59.1 61.1 Gross profit 41.1 40.9 38.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.1 23.0 24.2 Income from operations 19.0 17.9 14.7 Interest income 0.5 0.3 0.3 Other income Other expenses (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Income before income taxes 19.4 18.1 14.8 Income tax expense 7.5 7.2 6.0 Net income 11.9 % 10.9 % 8.8 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 31.9 % 51.0 % 29.7 % Gross profit 32.4 % 58.7 % 41.6 % Income from operations 40.0 % 83.8 % 77.8 % Net income 44.5 % 87.1 % 76.5 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net sales in fiscal 2006 increased by 31.9% to $1,092.1 million from $827.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The $264.3 million increase was primarily attributable to a $238.5 million, or 29.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $25.8 million or 9.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2006 was driven by a $133.7 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales, a $68.1 million or 10.9% increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $36.7 million or 39.0%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 6.4%, 28.0% and 14.9% increase for Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2006 and 28 new stores in fiscal 2005 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2006. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the average sales prices resulting from higher initial margins which more than offset a heavy increase in markdowns during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Comparable store transactions improved modestly while units per transaction were down slightly. Thus far during fiscal 2007, comparable store sales are below the same period in fiscal 2006. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation 22 Table of Contents of approximately 5.4 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at all brands. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit in fiscal 2006 increased to 41.1% of net sales or $448.6 million from 40.9% of net sales or $338.8 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the leveraging of store related occupancy costs, driven by the increase in comparable store sales which more than offset the increase in markdowns. Total inventories at January 31, 2006 increased by 41.8% to $140.4 million from $99.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories increased by 13.1% versus the prior fiscal year. Inventory supply at the first quarter of fiscal 2007 has exceeded the current sales trends and most likely will result in first quarter fiscal 2007 markdown rates exceeding the comparable quarter from last year. We anticipate making similar inventory investments in connection with new store openings in fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2006 decreased to 22.1% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 increased to $240.9 million from $190.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Accordingly, income from operations increased to 19.0% of net sales or $207.7 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 17.9% of net sales or $148.4 million for fiscal 2005. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 38.4% of income for fiscal 2006 compared to 39.8% of income for fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective state income tax rate due to a change in the weight of sales, property and income apportioned to lower tax jurisdictions. See Note 7 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Operating Leases In a February 2005 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC clarified its position regarding certain lease accounting practices. The SECs letter specifically addressed the depreciable life of leasehold improvements, rent holidays and landlord tenant incentives. Based upon the SECs conclusions included in their letter, we reviewed our historical treatment of these lease issues to ensure our accounting treatment reflected the SECs conclusions. Historically, we had recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period commencing on the date the store opened. The lease period did not include the construction period to make the lease space suitable for operations during which time we were not permitted to occupy the space for retail purposes. We changed our straight line period to include this construction period in our calculation of rent expense over the lease term, which results in an accounting lease term that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. Therefore, for purposes of calculating straight line rent expense, the commencement date of the lease term reflects the date we take possession of the building for initial construction and setup. 23 Table of Contents We had also historically classified tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of property and equipment. The related amortization was classified as a reduction of depreciation expense on our consolidated statements of income. Our consolidated statements of cash flows historically reflected tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities. We changed the classification of tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated financial statements to reflect such items as deferred rent that will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the straight line period. Furthermore, tenant improvement allowance activity is now presented as part of cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows After assessing our findings using the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, we recorded a cumulative adjustment of $4.6 million, net of tax, which reduced net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Net sales in fiscal 2005 increased by 51.0% to $827.8 million from $548.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The $279.4 million increase was primarily attributable to a $269.6 million, or 50.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $9.8 million or 1.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2005 was driven by a $131.5 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales, a $95.3 million or 21.6% increase in comparable store net sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $42.8 million or 83.6%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 24.0%, 51.0% and 19.7% increase for Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 28 new stores in fiscal 2005 and 21 new stores in fiscal 2004 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2005. Comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales prices resulting from higher initial price points which more than offset a modest increase in markdowns. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation of approximately 9.6 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at both Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit in fiscal 2005 increased to 40.9% of net sales or $338.8 million from $213.5 million or 38.9% of net sales in fiscal 2004. Improvements to initial margins due to better merchandise sourcing and the leveraging of store related occupancy costs, driven by the comparable store sales increases, accounted for the majority of this increase. This combined increase more than offset the $7.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, multi year cumulative charge to accelerate deferred rent for store locations resulting from our review of our historical method of accounting for certain operating leases. Total inventories at January 31, 2005 increased by 56.5% to $99.0 million from $63.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories increased by 19.8% versus the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2005 decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 24.2% of net sales for fiscal 2004. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 increased to $190.4 million from $132.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. 24 Table of Contents Accordingly, income from operations increased to 17.9% of net sales or $148.4 million for fiscal 2005 compared to 14.7% of net sales or $80.7 million for fiscal 2004. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 39.8% of income for fiscal 2005 compared to 40.5% of income for fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective state income tax rate due to a change in the weight of sales, property and income apportioned to lower tax jurisdictions. See Note 7, Income Taxes, in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $256.5 million as of January 31, 2006 as compared to $219.1 million as of January 31, 2005 and $139.5 million as of January 31, 2004. Increases in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, in all years presented, were primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities. Our working capital was $251.7 million, $189.6 million and $118.1 million for these years, respectively. The change in working capital is primarily due to the increase in our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories that have increased in order to support our current growth. During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $111.0 million, $60.1 million and $33.1 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2007, we plan to construct and open 35 to 38 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, increase our catalog circulation by 8 million, to 40 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores and direct to consumer business at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2007 to approximately $140 million, primarily to expand our store base and continue construction of our new home office campus. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. Improvements to our home office and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. The Company spent approximately $22 million on improvements at the Navy Yard during fiscal 2006. Total expenditures on the project are expected to be between $50 and $60 million to improve the property, net of potential incentive credits, most of which will be capitalized and depreciated based on the useful life of the improvements and fixtures. The project is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2007. We anticipate opening a distribution center in fiscal 2007 on the west coast of the United States to support our western stores. The facility will be financed through an operating lease, however, we expect to spend $3 to $5 million on equipment and other improvements. Furthermore, on February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 8,000,000 shares from time to time, based upon prevailing market conditions. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund our commitments and all such expansion related cash needs at least through fiscal 2009. 25 Table of Contents On September 30, 2004, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility (the Line). The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit to $50.0 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2006, the credit limit under the line is $42.5 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of January 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of and during the twelve months ended January 31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $29.0 million as of January 31, 2006. The available borrowing, including the accordion feature, under the Line was $21.0 million as of January 31, 2006. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2006: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less Than One Year One toThreeYears Four toFive Years More Than Five Years Operating leases (1) $ 673,779 $ 78,761 $ 164,229 $ 143,613 $ 287,176 Purchase orders (2) 151,137 151,137 Construction contracts (3) 36,814 36,814 Unsettled trades (4) 3,205 3,205 Total contractual obligations $ 864,935 $ 269,917 $ 164,229 $ 143,613 $ 287,176 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are ten locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these ten locations was approximately $2,973,000 for fiscal 2006. The leases pertaining to two of our Urban Outfitters stores in London at Covent Gardens and Oxford Street only specify our rent obligation for a five year period. The minimum rent obligation is then subject to review every five years. Included in the table above is an estimate of our rent obligation on these properties for the first five years. Amounts noted above include commitments for 26 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2006. (2) Includes an estimate of un fulfilled purchase orders for merchandise ordered from our vendors in the normal course of business, which are liquidated within 12 months. (3) Includes store construction contracts with contractors, fully liquidated upon the completion of construction which is typically within 12 months, as well as, executed construction contracts relating to the build out of our home office campus located at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. (4) Represents the purchase of two Securities which did not settle until February 2, 2006. 26 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears FourtoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 28,126 $ 28,126 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 904 904 Total commercial commitments $ 29,030 $ 29,030 $ $ $ (1) Consists solely of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2006, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any off balance sheet arrangements. Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS No. 123R and the valuation of share based payments for public companies. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date or later modification. In addition, SFAS No. 123R will require stock based compensation resulting from the continued vesting of grants issued prior to adoption of SFAS 123R to be reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining requisite service period. We will adopt SFAS No. 123R on February 1, 2006, using the Modified Prospective Approach (MPA). The MPA requires that compensation expense be recorded for restricted stock and all unvested stock options beginning as of February 1, 2006. We expect to continue using the Black Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees. For pro forma footnote disclosure purposes, we recognized the majority of our share based compensation costs using the accelerated recognition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will continue to recognize the cost of previously granted share based awards under the accelerated recognition method. SFAS No. 123R will also require us to change the classification of any tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of that which is associated with the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes. These amounts will be presented as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of income taxes paid in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We are continuing to evaluate the requirements of SFAS No. 123R and SAB 107. As of February 1, 2006, unvested stock based compensation expense, not including our restricted stock grant, is approximately $2.6 million and we currently expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in an increase in compensation expense for fiscal 2007 of approximately $1.7 million. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This 27 Table of Contents Interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. This Interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. We adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. Previously, voluntary changes in accounting principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net earnings during the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 05 06, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements. EITF 05 06 provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease, collectively referred to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements. EITF 05 06 provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of (a) the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements useful lives, or (b) a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase. EITF 05 06 is effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after the date of the FASBs ratification, which was on June 29, 2005. We adopted EITF 05 06 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period, to clarify the proper accounting for rental costs incurred on building or ground operating leases during a construction period. The FSP requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed, not capitalized. The statement is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not believe adoption of FSP 13 1 will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 28 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2006 Quarter Ended April 30,2005 July 31,2005 Oct. 31,2005 Jan. 31,2006 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 231,325 $ 253,392 $ 288,801 $ 318,589 Gross profit 97,617 104,836 120,251 125,902 Net income 27,440 30,601 37,162 35,593 Net income per common share basic 0.17 0.19 0.23 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.16 0.18 0.22 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 23 % 26 % 29 % Net income 21 % 23 % 29 % 27 % Fiscal 2005 Quarter Ended April 30,2004 July 31,2004 Oct. 31,2004 Jan. 31,2005 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 170,290 $ 189,484 $ 216,353 $ 251,623 Gross profit 69,894 77,018 91,458 100,380 Net income 16,869 20,508 26,036 27,076 Net income per common share basic 0.11 0.13 0.16 0.17 Net income per common share diluted 0.10 0.12 0.15 0.16 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 23 % 26 % 30 % Net income 19 % 22 % 29 % 30 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2006, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated AA or better, auction rate securities rated AA or better and money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash 29 Table of Contents equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments, a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People stores and our direct to consumer operations, which consist of a catalog and web site for each of these brands. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2006, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and internet sales, are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, correlate to changes in customer traffic. We believe this may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, additional circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base, including expansion into enclosed malls and specialty retail centers. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2006 ended on January 31, 2006. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. We plan to grow our store base by approximately 20% per year. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2006, we operated 90 Urban Outfitters stores of which 80 are located in the United States, three in Canada and seven in Europe. During fiscal 2006, we opened 15 new Urban Outfitters stores, twelve of which are located within the United States, one store which we opened in Canada and two of which we opened in the United Kingdom. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Retails North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 42% and 4% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2006. We operated 79 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2006, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2006 we opened 14 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open many additional stores over the next several years. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 36% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. 17 Table of Contents We operated six Free People stores as of January 31, 2006, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2006 we opened four new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several fiscal years. Free Peoples retail sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 35 to 38 stores during fiscal 2007, including three to five new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Our goal thereafter is to increase net sales by at least 20% per year through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Direct to consumer In March 1998, Anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2006, we circulated over 19 million catalogs and believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 21 million catalogs during fiscal 2007 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Anthropologie operates an Internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.anthropologie.com, debuted in December 1998. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. In fiscal 2006, we circulated approximately 11 million Urban Outfitters catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 14 million catalogs in fiscal 2007. Urban Outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the store. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. We successfully launched the Free People web site in September 2004. The web site, www.freepeople.com, offers consumers the entire Free People product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. In October 2005, Free People introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Free People stores. In fiscal 2006, we circulated approximately 2 million Free People catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 5 million catalogs in fiscal 2007. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 12% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. 18 Table of Contents Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Our range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately 1,500 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Marshall Fields, Macy*s West, Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Payment for merchandise at our stores, and through our direct to consumer business, is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially different than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2006 and 2005, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $6.4 million and $4.5 million, representing 3.1% and 2.9% of total liabilities, respectively. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost 19 Table of Contents of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories, such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. Criteria we use to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value, if required. Inventories as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 totaled $140.4 million and $99.0 million, representing 18.2% and 17.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Our reserves related to adjusting the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on recent historical trends. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, as well as furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 totaled $299.3 million and $192.8 million, respectively, representing 38.9% and 34.6% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of the Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, write downs of long lived assets were immaterial. We have only closed three store locations in our history, which in all cases took place at the expiration of the lease and renewal terms. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. 20 Table of Contents As of January 31, 2006, all of our stores opened in excess of three years are generating positive cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 totaled $23.9 million and $16.7 million, respectively, representing 3.1% and 3.0% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we must establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We had valuation allowances of $3.1 million as of January 31, 2006 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances if appropriate. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 58.9 59.1 61.1 Gross profit 41.1 40.9 38.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.1 23.0 24.2 Income from operations 19.0 17.9 14.7 Interest income 0.5 0.3 0.3 Other income Other expenses (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Income before income taxes 19.4 18.1 14.8 Income tax expense 7.5 7.2 6.0 Net income 11.9 % 10.9 % 8.8 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 31.9 % 51.0 % 29.7 % Gross profit 32.4 % 58.7 % 41.6 % Income from operations 40.0 % 83.8 % 77.8 % Net income 44.5 % 87.1 % 76.5 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net sales in fiscal 2006 increased by 31.9% to $1,092.1 million from $827.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The $264.3 million increase was primarily attributable to a $238.5 million, or 29.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $25.8 million or 9.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2006 was driven by a $133.7 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales, a $68.1 million or 10.9% increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $36.7 million or 39.0%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 6.4%, 28.0% and 14.9% increase for Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2006 and 28 new stores in fiscal 2005 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2006. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the average sales prices resulting from higher initial margins which more than offset a heavy increase in markdowns during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Comparable store transactions improved modestly while units per transaction were down slightly. Thus far during fiscal 2007, comparable store sales are below the same period in fiscal 2006. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation 22 Table of Contents of approximately 5.4 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at all brands. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit in fiscal 2006 increased to 41.1% of net sales or $448.6 million from 40.9% of net sales or $338.8 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the leveraging of store related occupancy costs, driven by the increase in comparable store sales which more than offset the increase in markdowns. Total inventories at January 31, 2006 increased by 41.8% to $140.4 million from $99.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories increased by 13.1% versus the prior fiscal year. Inventory supply at the first quarter of fiscal 2007 has exceeded the current sales trends and most likely will result in first quarter fiscal 2007 markdown rates exceeding the comparable quarter from last year. We anticipate making similar inventory investments in connection with new store openings in fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2006 decreased to 22.1% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 increased to $240.9 million from $190.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Accordingly, income from operations increased to 19.0% of net sales or $207.7 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 17.9% of net sales or $148.4 million for fiscal 2005. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 38.4% of income for fiscal 2006 compared to 39.8% of income for fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective state income tax rate due to a change in the weight of sales, property and income apportioned to lower tax jurisdictions. See Note 7 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Operating Leases In a February 2005 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC clarified its position regarding certain lease accounting practices. The SECs letter specifically addressed the depreciable life of leasehold improvements, rent holidays and landlord tenant incentives. Based upon the SECs conclusions included in their letter, we reviewed our historical treatment of these lease issues to ensure our accounting treatment reflected the SECs conclusions. Historically, we had recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period commencing on the date the store opened. The lease period did not include the construction period to make the lease space suitable for operations during which time we were not permitted to occupy the space for retail purposes. We changed our straight line period to include this construction period in our calculation of rent expense over the lease term, which results in an accounting lease term that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. Therefore, for purposes of calculating straight line rent expense, the commencement date of the lease term reflects the date we take possession of the building for initial construction and setup. 23 Table of Contents We had also historically classified tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of property and equipment. The related amortization was classified as a reduction of depreciation expense on our consolidated statements of income. Our consolidated statements of cash flows historically reflected tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities. We changed the classification of tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated financial statements to reflect such items as deferred rent that will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the straight line period. Furthermore, tenant improvement allowance activity is now presented as part of cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows After assessing our findings using the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, we recorded a cumulative adjustment of $4.6 million, net of tax, which reduced net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Net sales in fiscal 2005 increased by 51.0% to $827.8 million from $548.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The $279.4 million increase was primarily attributable to a $269.6 million, or 50.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $9.8 million or 1.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2005 was driven by a $131.5 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales, a $95.3 million or 21.6% increase in comparable store net sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $42.8 million or 83.6%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 24.0%, 51.0% and 19.7% increase for Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 28 new stores in fiscal 2005 and 21 new stores in fiscal 2004 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2005. Comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales prices resulting from higher initial price points which more than offset a modest increase in markdowns. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation of approximately 9.6 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at both Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit in fiscal 2005 increased to 40.9% of net sales or $338.8 million from $213.5 million or 38.9% of net sales in fiscal 2004. Improvements to initial margins due to better merchandise sourcing and the leveraging of store related occupancy costs, driven by the comparable store sales increases, accounted for the majority of this increase. This combined increase more than offset the $7.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, multi year cumulative charge to accelerate deferred rent for store locations resulting from our review of our historical method of accounting for certain operating leases. Total inventories at January 31, 2005 increased by 56.5% to $99.0 million from $63.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories increased by 19.8% versus the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2005 decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 24.2% of net sales for fiscal 2004. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 increased to $190.4 million from $132.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. 24 Table of Contents Accordingly, income from operations increased to 17.9% of net sales or $148.4 million for fiscal 2005 compared to 14.7% of net sales or $80.7 million for fiscal 2004. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 39.8% of income for fiscal 2005 compared to 40.5% of income for fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective state income tax rate due to a change in the weight of sales, property and income apportioned to lower tax jurisdictions. See Note 7, Income Taxes, in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $256.5 million as of January 31, 2006 as compared to $219.1 million as of January 31, 2005 and $139.5 million as of January 31, 2004. Increases in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, in all years presented, were primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities. Our working capital was $251.7 million, $189.6 million and $118.1 million for these years, respectively. The change in working capital is primarily due to the increase in our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories that have increased in order to support our current growth. During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $111.0 million, $60.1 million and $33.1 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2007, we plan to construct and open 35 to 38 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, increase our catalog circulation by 8 million, to 40 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores and direct to consumer business at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2007 to approximately $140 million, primarily to expand our store base and continue construction of our new home office campus. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. Improvements to our home office and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. The Company spent approximately $22 million on improvements at the Navy Yard during fiscal 2006. Total expenditures on the project are expected to be between $50 and $60 million to improve the property, net of potential incentive credits, most of which will be capitalized and depreciated based on the useful life of the improvements and fixtures. The project is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2007. We anticipate opening a distribution center in fiscal 2007 on the west coast of the United States to support our western stores. The facility will be financed through an operating lease, however, we expect to spend $3 to $5 million on equipment and other improvements. Furthermore, on February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 8,000,000 shares from time to time, based upon prevailing market conditions. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund our commitments and all such expansion related cash needs at least through fiscal 2009. 25 Table of Contents On September 30, 2004, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility (the Line). The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit to $50.0 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2006, the credit limit under the line is $42.5 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of January 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of and during the twelve months ended January 31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $29.0 million as of January 31, 2006. The available borrowing, including the accordion feature, under the Line was $21.0 million as of January 31, 2006. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2006: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less Than One Year One toThreeYears Four toFive Years More Than Five Years Operating leases (1) $ 673,779 $ 78,761 $ 164,229 $ 143,613 $ 287,176 Purchase orders (2) 151,137 151,137 Construction contracts (3) 36,814 36,814 Unsettled trades (4) 3,205 3,205 Total contractual obligations $ 864,935 $ 269,917 $ 164,229 $ 143,613 $ 287,176 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are ten locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these ten locations was approximately $2,973,000 for fiscal 2006. The leases pertaining to two of our Urban Outfitters stores in London at Covent Gardens and Oxford Street only specify our rent obligation for a five year period. The minimum rent obligation is then subject to review every five years. Included in the table above is an estimate of our rent obligation on these properties for the first five years. Amounts noted above include commitments for 26 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2006. (2) Includes an estimate of un fulfilled purchase orders for merchandise ordered from our vendors in the normal course of business, which are liquidated within 12 months. (3) Includes store construction contracts with contractors, fully liquidated upon the completion of construction which is typically within 12 months, as well as, executed construction contracts relating to the build out of our home office campus located at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. (4) Represents the purchase of two Securities which did not settle until February 2, 2006. 26 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears FourtoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 28,126 $ 28,126 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 904 904 Total commercial commitments $ 29,030 $ 29,030 $ $ $ (1) Consists solely of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2006, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any off balance sheet arrangements. Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS No. 123R and the valuation of share based payments for public companies. SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date or later modification. In addition, SFAS No. 123R will require stock based compensation resulting from the continued vesting of grants issued prior to adoption of SFAS 123R to be reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining requisite service period. We will adopt SFAS No. 123R on February 1, 2006, using the Modified Prospective Approach (MPA). The MPA requires that compensation expense be recorded for restricted stock and all unvested stock options beginning as of February 1, 2006. We expect to continue using the Black Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees. For pro forma footnote disclosure purposes, we recognized the majority of our share based compensation costs using the accelerated recognition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will continue to recognize the cost of previously granted share based awards under the accelerated recognition method. SFAS No. 123R will also require us to change the classification of any tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of that which is associated with the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes. These amounts will be presented as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of income taxes paid in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We are continuing to evaluate the requirements of SFAS No. 123R and SAB 107. As of February 1, 2006, unvested stock based compensation expense, not including our restricted stock grant, is approximately $2.6 million and we currently expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in an increase in compensation expense for fiscal 2007 of approximately $1.7 million. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This 27 Table of Contents Interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. This Interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. We adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. Previously, voluntary changes in accounting principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net earnings during the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 05 06, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements. EITF 05 06 provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease, collectively referred to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements. EITF 05 06 provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of (a) the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements useful lives, or (b) a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase. EITF 05 06 is effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after the date of the FASBs ratification, which was on June 29, 2005. We adopted EITF 05 06 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period, to clarify the proper accounting for rental costs incurred on building or ground operating leases during a construction period. The FSP requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed, not capitalized. The statement is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not believe adoption of FSP 13 1 will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 28 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2006 Quarter Ended April 30,2005 July 31,2005 Oct. 31,2005 Jan. 31,2006 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 231,325 $ 253,392 $ 288,801 $ 318,589 Gross profit 97,617 104,836 120,251 125,902 Net income 27,440 30,601 37,162 35,593 Net income per common share basic 0.17 0.19 0.23 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.16 0.18 0.22 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 23 % 26 % 29 % Net income 21 % 23 % 29 % 27 % Fiscal 2005 Quarter Ended April 30,2004 July 31,2004 Oct. 31,2004 Jan. 31,2005 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 170,290 $ 189,484 $ 216,353 $ 251,623 Gross profit 69,894 77,018 91,458 100,380 Net income 16,869 20,508 26,036 27,076 Net income per common share basic 0.11 0.13 0.16 0.17 Net income per common share diluted 0.10 0.12 0.15 0.16 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 23 % 26 % 30 % Net income 19 % 22 % 29 % 30 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2006, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated AA or better, auction rate securities rated AA or better and money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash 29 Table of Contents equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.
