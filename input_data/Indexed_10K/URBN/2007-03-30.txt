Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments, a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People Wholesale division that designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2007, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and internet sales, are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, correlate to changes in customer traffic. We believe this may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, additional circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base, including expansion into enclosed malls and specialty retail centers. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2007 ended on January 31, 2007. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least 12 full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. Our goal is to increase net sales by at least 20% per year through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2007, we operated 106 Urban Outfitters stores of which 94 are located in the United States, three are located in Canada and nine are located in Europe. During fiscal 2007, we opened 16 new Urban Outfitters stores, 14 of which are located within the United States and two of which are located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urbans North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 38.9% and 5.8% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2007. We operated 93 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2007, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2007 we opened 14 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment 19 Table of Contents includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 35.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. We operated eight Free People stores as of January 31, 2007, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2007 we opened two new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several fiscal years. Free Peoples retail sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. For all brands combined, we plan to open at least 38 stores during fiscal 2008, including six to ten new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. We plan to grow our store base by approximately 20% per year. Direct to consumer In March 1998, Anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2007, we circulated approximately 21.8 million catalogs and believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to modestly expand circulation to approximately 21.9 million catalogs during fiscal 2008 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Anthropologie operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.anthropologie.com, debuted in December 1998. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2007, we circulated approximately 11.4 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 12.0 million in fiscal 2008 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Urban Outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers, as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. In August 2006, Urban Outfitters launched a web site targeting our European customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk, captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution 20 Table of Contents center located in the United Kingdom. We believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with our European customers as well as helps to support our Urban Outfitters European store operations. We successfully launched the Free People web site, www.freepeople.com, in September 2004. The web site offers consumers the entire Free People product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. In October 2005, Free People introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Free People stores. In fiscal 2007, we circulated approximately 3.3 million Free People catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 4.3 million catalogs in fiscal 2008 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 12.6% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately 1,500 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor, Parisian, Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 6.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and 21 Table of Contents direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale business accounts receivable which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially different than our estimate, the reserve will be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2007 and 2006, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $8.9 million and $6.4 million, representing 4.0% and 3.1% of total liabilities, respectively. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories, such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. Criteria we use to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and inventory currently priced below its original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value, if required. Net inventories as of January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 totaled $154.4 million and $140.4 million, representing 17.2% and 18.2% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventory at January 31, 2007 and recent historical trends. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and buildings, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including 22 Table of Contents lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 totaled $445.7 million and $299.3 million, respectively, representing 49.6% and 38.9% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have only closed three store locations in our history, which in all cases, were eventually re located, and took place at the expiration of the lease and renewal terms. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. We did not close any store locations in fiscal 2007. As of the date of this report, all of our stores opened in excess of three years are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 totaled $28.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively, representing 3.2% and 3.1% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We reduced valuation allowances to $0.2 million as of January 31, 2007 from $3.1 million as of January 31, 2006. This reduction occurred based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future 23 Table of Contents taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions. Existing valuation allowances are due to remaining uncertainties related to our ability to utilize other net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 63.1 58.9 59.1 Gross profit 36.9 41.1 40.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.5 22.1 23.0 Income from operations 13.4 19.0 17.9 Interest income 0.5 0.5 0.3 Other income Other expenses (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Income before income taxes 13.9 19.4 18.1 Income tax expense 4.4 7.5 7.2 Net income 9.5 % 11.9 % 10.9 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 12.1 % 31.9 % 51.0 % Gross profit 0.7 % 32.4 % 58.7 % Income from operations (21.0 )% 40.0 % 83.8 % Net income (11.2 )% 44.5 % 87.1 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net sales in fiscal 2007 increased by 12.1% to $1.22 billion, from $1.09 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $133 million increase was primarily attributable to a $112 million or 10.7% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $21 million or 15.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2007 was driven by a $139 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $23 million or 17.7% that more than offset a $50 million or 6.2% decline in comparable store sales. The decrease in comparable store net sales was comprised of 5.0% and 7.2% declines at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Free People comparable store sales increased 11.5% for fiscal year 2007. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 32 new stores in fiscal 2007 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2006 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2007. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of a decrease in transactions, and a slight decrease in the average unit sales prices resulting from a lower response to the Companys merchandise offerings as it adjusted to a significant shift in fashion trends. These decreases more than offset a modest increase in the number of units sold per transaction. Thus far during fiscal 2008, total Company comparable store sales are positive. Direct to consumer net 25 Table of Contents sales increased over the prior year primarily due to improved customer response related to the circulation of approximately 5 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to our web sites and improvements in the average order value at all brands. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by a favorable customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2007 decreased to 36.9% of net sales or $452 million from 41.1% of net sales or $449 million in fiscal 2006. These reductions were primarily due to additional markdowns and price adjustments to clear seasonal inventory, a higher rate of fixed store occupancy expense due to comparable store sales decreases and increases to inventory related valuation reserves. Total inventories at January 31, 2007 increased by 10.0% to $154 million from $140 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories decreased by 2.9% versus the prior fiscal year. We anticipate making similar inventory investments in connection with new store openings in fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 increased to 23.5% of net sales versus 22.1% of net sales for fiscal 2006. This unfavorable increase was primarily attributable to the de leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the decreases in comparable store sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 increased to $288 million from $241 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations decreased to 13.4% of net sales or $164 million for fiscal 2007 compared to 19.0% of net sales or $208 million for fiscal 2006. Our annual effective income tax rate improved to 31.7% of income for fiscal 2007 compared to 38.4% of income for fiscal 2006. This decrease is based upon a number of factors including: certification for work performed on the development of our new offices that qualifies for certain one time federal tax incentives; the execution of certain related reorganization efforts and the relief of certain valuation allowances related to net operating loss carry forwards of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. We believe we will receive an additional one time benefit in fiscal 2008 from our office relocation work and on going benefits in fiscal 2008 and future years from our tax planning efforts. See Note 7 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net sales in fiscal 2006 increased by 31.9% to $1.09 billion, from $828 million in the prior fiscal year. The $264 million increase was primarily attributable to a $239 million or 29.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $26 million or 9.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2006 was driven by a $134 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales, a $68 million or 10.9% increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $37 million or 39.0%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 6.4%, 28.0% and 14.9% increase for Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2006 and 28 new stores in fiscal 2005 that were considered 26 Table of Contents non comparable during fiscal 2006. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the average sales prices resulting from higher initial margins which more than offset a heavy increase in markdowns during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Comparable store transactions improved modestly while units per transaction were down slightly. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation of approximately 5.4 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at all brands. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit in fiscal 2006 increased to 41.1% of net sales or $449 million from 40.9% of net sales or $339 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the leveraging of store related occupancy costs, driven by the increase in comparable store sales which more than offset the increase in markdowns. Total inventories at January 31, 2006 increased by 41.8% to $140 million from $99 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories increased by 13.1% versus the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2006 decreased to 22.1% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 increased to $241 million from $190 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Accordingly, income from operations increased to 19.0% of net sales or $208 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 17.9% of net sales or $148 million for fiscal 2005. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 38.4% of income for fiscal 2006 compared to 39.8% of income for fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective state income tax rate due to a change in the weight of sales, property and income apportioned to lower tax jurisdictions. See Note 7 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $222 million as of January 31, 2007 as compared to $257 million as of January 31, 2006 and $219 million as of January 31, 2005. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2007 occurred primarily as a result of investments in store related property and equipment and the completion of our new offices at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Navy Yard expenditures approximated $82 million during fiscal 2007. We also repurchased approximately $21 million of our common shares during the year. Cash used in these investing and financing activities offset $187 million of cash provided by operations. During fiscal years 2006 and 2005, cash increases were primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities. Our working capital for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $231 million, $252 million and $190 million, respectively. The changes in working capital primarily relate to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. 27 Table of Contents During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $193 million, $111 million and $60 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2008, we plan to construct and open at least 38 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, increase our catalog circulation by approximately 2 million to approximately 38 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores and direct to consumer business at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to reduce the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 to approximately $100 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. Improvements to our home office and distribution facilities were necessary to adequately support our growth. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 we spent approximately $82 million and $22 million, respectively, on improvements made to our offices at the Navy Yard. Total expenditures for the project as of January 31, 2007, were approximately $104 million at which time the project was complete. We anticipate opening a distribution center in fiscal 2008 on the west coast of the United States to support our western stores. We expect the facility will be financed through an operating lease and that we will spend $3 to $5 million on equipment and other improvements. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to 8,000,000 common shares from time to time, based upon prevailing market conditions. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,220,000 shares at a cost of approximately $21 million. We anticipate making investments to begin testing a new retail concept during fiscal 2008. We are still in the stages of developing the format and market objectives of the concept and have yet to determine or quantify the extent of such an investment. Expenditures may include the costs of strategic research and development, hiring personnel to develop and execute a store format, obtaining leases and related store inventory, property and equipment, acquiring assets or existing businesses, intellectual property and trade secrets or intangible knowledge and any other costs related to developing and executing this new concept. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund our commitments and all such expansion related cash needs at least through fiscal 2010. On September 30, 2004, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility (the Line). The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit to $50 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2007, the credit limit under the Line was $43 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. On November 30, 2006 we amended 28 Table of Contents our line to increase our capital expenditure limit and add additional subsidiaries that are permitted to borrow. As of January 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of and during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $32 million as of January 31, 2007. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line was $18 million as of January 31, 2007. We plan to renew the Line during fiscal 2008 and expect the renewal will include the expansion of the available credit limit under the Line to an amount that will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal 2010. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2007: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description Total Obligations Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More Than Five Years Operating leases (1) $ 719,785 $ 92,280 $ 184,606 $ 152,197 $ 290,702 Purchase orders 26,769 26,769 Construction contracts (2) 4,922 4,922 Total contractual obligations $ 751,476 $ 123,971 $ 184,606 $ 152,197 $ 290,702 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are five locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these five locations was approximately $861,000 for fiscal 2007. The leases pertaining to two of our Urban Outfitters stores in London at Covent Gardens and Oxford Street only specify our rent obligation for a five year period. The minimum rent obligation is then subject to review every five years. Included in the table above is an estimate of our rent obligation on these properties for the first five years. Amounts noted above include commitments for 27 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2007. (2) Pertains to store construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. 29 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description Total Amounts Committed Amount of Commitment Per Period (in thousands) Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More Than Five Years Line of credit (1) $ 30,606 $ 30,606 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 1,735 1,735 Total commercial commitments $ 32,341 $ 32,341 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2007, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any off balance sheet arrangements. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 could have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 could have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC staff published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) ratified its consensus on Issue No. 06 03, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be 30 Table of Contents Presented in the Income Statement. EITF 06 3 addresses what type of government assessments should be included within the scope of EITF 06 3, and how such government assessments should be presented in the income statement. The EITF concluded that the scope of EITF 06 3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes. In addition the EITF also concluded that the presentation of taxes, within the scope of EITF 06 3, on either a gross or net basis, is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 22, Disclosure of Accounting Policies. In addition, for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant. The EITF observed that because EITF 06 3 requires only the presentation of additional disclosures, an entity would not be required to re evaluate its existing policies related to taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer. EITF 06 3 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt the disclosure requirements of EITF 06 3 effective February 1, 2007, however, since we present revenue on a net basis, no further disclosure under EITF 06 3 will be required. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The new standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of FIN 48 is expected to result in adjustments to our tax contingency reserves and deferred income taxes which could be material, with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We have not completed our evaluation of FIN 48 nor measured its impact on our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2007 Quarter Ended April 30, 2006 July 31, 2006 Oct. 31, 2006 Jan. 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 270,007 $ 285,559 $ 308,355 $ 360,796 Gross profit 96,768 104,752 117,948 132,453 Net income 20,299 25,662 34,514 35,731 Net income per common share basic 0.12 0.16 0.21 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.12 0.15 0.21 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 23 % 25 % 30 % Net income 17 % 22 % 30 % 31 % Fiscal 2006 Quarter Ended April 30, 2005 July 31, 2005 Oct. 31, 2005 Jan. 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 231,325 $ 253,392 $ 288,801 $ 318,589 Gross profit 97,617 104,836 120,251 125,902 Net income 27,440 30,601 37,162 35,593 Net income per common share basic 0.17 0.19 0.23 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.16 0.18 0.22 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 23 % 26 % 29 % Net income 21 % 23 % 29 % 27 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated AA or better, auction rate securities rated AA or better and money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not 32 Table of Contents have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments, a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People Wholesale division that designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2007, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and internet sales, are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, correlate to changes in customer traffic. We believe this may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, additional circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base, including expansion into enclosed malls and specialty retail centers. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2007 ended on January 31, 2007. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least 12 full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. Our goal is to increase net sales by at least 20% per year through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2007, we operated 106 Urban Outfitters stores of which 94 are located in the United States, three are located in Canada and nine are located in Europe. During fiscal 2007, we opened 16 new Urban Outfitters stores, 14 of which are located within the United States and two of which are located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urbans North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 38.9% and 5.8% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2007. We operated 93 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2007, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2007 we opened 14 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment 19 Table of Contents includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 35.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. We operated eight Free People stores as of January 31, 2007, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2007 we opened two new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several fiscal years. Free Peoples retail sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. For all brands combined, we plan to open at least 38 stores during fiscal 2008, including six to ten new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. We plan to grow our store base by approximately 20% per year. Direct to consumer In March 1998, Anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2007, we circulated approximately 21.8 million catalogs and believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to modestly expand circulation to approximately 21.9 million catalogs during fiscal 2008 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Anthropologie operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.anthropologie.com, debuted in December 1998. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2007, we circulated approximately 11.4 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 12.0 million in fiscal 2008 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Urban Outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers, as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. In August 2006, Urban Outfitters launched a web site targeting our European customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk, captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution 20 Table of Contents center located in the United Kingdom. We believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with our European customers as well as helps to support our Urban Outfitters European store operations. We successfully launched the Free People web site, www.freepeople.com, in September 2004. The web site offers consumers the entire Free People product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. In October 2005, Free People introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our Free People stores. In fiscal 2007, we circulated approximately 3.3 million Free People catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand circulation to approximately 4.3 million catalogs in fiscal 2008 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 12.6% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately 1,500 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor, Parisian, Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 6.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and 21 Table of Contents direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale business accounts receivable which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially different than our estimate, the reserve will be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2007 and 2006, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $8.9 million and $6.4 million, representing 4.0% and 3.1% of total liabilities, respectively. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories, such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values. Criteria we use to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and inventory currently priced below its original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value, if required. Net inventories as of January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 totaled $154.4 million and $140.4 million, representing 17.2% and 18.2% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventory at January 31, 2007 and recent historical trends. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and buildings, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including 22 Table of Contents lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 totaled $445.7 million and $299.3 million, respectively, representing 49.6% and 38.9% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have only closed three store locations in our history, which in all cases, were eventually re located, and took place at the expiration of the lease and renewal terms. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. We did not close any store locations in fiscal 2007. As of the date of this report, all of our stores opened in excess of three years are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 totaled $28.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively, representing 3.2% and 3.1% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We reduced valuation allowances to $0.2 million as of January 31, 2007 from $3.1 million as of January 31, 2006. This reduction occurred based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future 23 Table of Contents taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions. Existing valuation allowances are due to remaining uncertainties related to our ability to utilize other net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 63.1 58.9 59.1 Gross profit 36.9 41.1 40.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.5 22.1 23.0 Income from operations 13.4 19.0 17.9 Interest income 0.5 0.5 0.3 Other income Other expenses (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Income before income taxes 13.9 19.4 18.1 Income tax expense 4.4 7.5 7.2 Net income 9.5 % 11.9 % 10.9 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 12.1 % 31.9 % 51.0 % Gross profit 0.7 % 32.4 % 58.7 % Income from operations (21.0 )% 40.0 % 83.8 % Net income (11.2 )% 44.5 % 87.1 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net sales in fiscal 2007 increased by 12.1% to $1.22 billion, from $1.09 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $133 million increase was primarily attributable to a $112 million or 10.7% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $21 million or 15.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2007 was driven by a $139 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $23 million or 17.7% that more than offset a $50 million or 6.2% decline in comparable store sales. The decrease in comparable store net sales was comprised of 5.0% and 7.2% declines at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, respectively. Free People comparable store sales increased 11.5% for fiscal year 2007. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 32 new stores in fiscal 2007 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2006 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2007. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of a decrease in transactions, and a slight decrease in the average unit sales prices resulting from a lower response to the Companys merchandise offerings as it adjusted to a significant shift in fashion trends. These decreases more than offset a modest increase in the number of units sold per transaction. Thus far during fiscal 2008, total Company comparable store sales are positive. Direct to consumer net 25 Table of Contents sales increased over the prior year primarily due to improved customer response related to the circulation of approximately 5 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to our web sites and improvements in the average order value at all brands. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by a favorable customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2007 decreased to 36.9% of net sales or $452 million from 41.1% of net sales or $449 million in fiscal 2006. These reductions were primarily due to additional markdowns and price adjustments to clear seasonal inventory, a higher rate of fixed store occupancy expense due to comparable store sales decreases and increases to inventory related valuation reserves. Total inventories at January 31, 2007 increased by 10.0% to $154 million from $140 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories decreased by 2.9% versus the prior fiscal year. We anticipate making similar inventory investments in connection with new store openings in fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 increased to 23.5% of net sales versus 22.1% of net sales for fiscal 2006. This unfavorable increase was primarily attributable to the de leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the decreases in comparable store sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 increased to $288 million from $241 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations decreased to 13.4% of net sales or $164 million for fiscal 2007 compared to 19.0% of net sales or $208 million for fiscal 2006. Our annual effective income tax rate improved to 31.7% of income for fiscal 2007 compared to 38.4% of income for fiscal 2006. This decrease is based upon a number of factors including: certification for work performed on the development of our new offices that qualifies for certain one time federal tax incentives; the execution of certain related reorganization efforts and the relief of certain valuation allowances related to net operating loss carry forwards of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. We believe we will receive an additional one time benefit in fiscal 2008 from our office relocation work and on going benefits in fiscal 2008 and future years from our tax planning efforts. See Note 7 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net sales in fiscal 2006 increased by 31.9% to $1.09 billion, from $828 million in the prior fiscal year. The $264 million increase was primarily attributable to a $239 million or 29.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Free People wholesale sales contributed $26 million or 9.8%, excluding sales to our retail segment, to the increase. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2006 was driven by a $134 million increase in non comparable and new store net sales, a $68 million or 10.9% increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of $37 million or 39.0%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a 6.4%, 28.0% and 14.9% increase for Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2006 and 28 new stores in fiscal 2005 that were considered 26 Table of Contents non comparable during fiscal 2006. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the average sales prices resulting from higher initial margins which more than offset a heavy increase in markdowns during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Comparable store transactions improved modestly while units per transaction were down slightly. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation of approximately 5.4 million additional catalogs, increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at all brands. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings. Gross profit in fiscal 2006 increased to 41.1% of net sales or $449 million from 40.9% of net sales or $339 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the leveraging of store related occupancy costs, driven by the increase in comparable store sales which more than offset the increase in markdowns. Total inventories at January 31, 2006 increased by 41.8% to $140 million from $99 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories increased by 13.1% versus the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2006 decreased to 22.1% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 increased to $241 million from $190 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Accordingly, income from operations increased to 19.0% of net sales or $208 million for fiscal 2006 compared to 17.9% of net sales or $148 million for fiscal 2005. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 38.4% of income for fiscal 2006 compared to 39.8% of income for fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective state income tax rate due to a change in the weight of sales, property and income apportioned to lower tax jurisdictions. See Note 7 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $222 million as of January 31, 2007 as compared to $257 million as of January 31, 2006 and $219 million as of January 31, 2005. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2007 occurred primarily as a result of investments in store related property and equipment and the completion of our new offices at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Navy Yard expenditures approximated $82 million during fiscal 2007. We also repurchased approximately $21 million of our common shares during the year. Cash used in these investing and financing activities offset $187 million of cash provided by operations. During fiscal years 2006 and 2005, cash increases were primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities. Our working capital for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $231 million, $252 million and $190 million, respectively. The changes in working capital primarily relate to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. 27 Table of Contents During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $193 million, $111 million and $60 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2008, we plan to construct and open at least 38 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, increase our catalog circulation by approximately 2 million to approximately 38 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores and direct to consumer business at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to reduce the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 to approximately $100 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. Improvements to our home office and distribution facilities were necessary to adequately support our growth. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 we spent approximately $82 million and $22 million, respectively, on improvements made to our offices at the Navy Yard. Total expenditures for the project as of January 31, 2007, were approximately $104 million at which time the project was complete. We anticipate opening a distribution center in fiscal 2008 on the west coast of the United States to support our western stores. We expect the facility will be financed through an operating lease and that we will spend $3 to $5 million on equipment and other improvements. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to 8,000,000 common shares from time to time, based upon prevailing market conditions. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,220,000 shares at a cost of approximately $21 million. We anticipate making investments to begin testing a new retail concept during fiscal 2008. We are still in the stages of developing the format and market objectives of the concept and have yet to determine or quantify the extent of such an investment. Expenditures may include the costs of strategic research and development, hiring personnel to develop and execute a store format, obtaining leases and related store inventory, property and equipment, acquiring assets or existing businesses, intellectual property and trade secrets or intangible knowledge and any other costs related to developing and executing this new concept. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund our commitments and all such expansion related cash needs at least through fiscal 2010. On September 30, 2004, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility (the Line). The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit to $50 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2007, the credit limit under the Line was $43 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. On November 30, 2006 we amended 28 Table of Contents our line to increase our capital expenditure limit and add additional subsidiaries that are permitted to borrow. As of January 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of and during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $32 million as of January 31, 2007. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line was $18 million as of January 31, 2007. We plan to renew the Line during fiscal 2008 and expect the renewal will include the expansion of the available credit limit under the Line to an amount that will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal 2010. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2007: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description Total Obligations Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More Than Five Years Operating leases (1) $ 719,785 $ 92,280 $ 184,606 $ 152,197 $ 290,702 Purchase orders 26,769 26,769 Construction contracts (2) 4,922 4,922 Total contractual obligations $ 751,476 $ 123,971 $ 184,606 $ 152,197 $ 290,702 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are five locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these five locations was approximately $861,000 for fiscal 2007. The leases pertaining to two of our Urban Outfitters stores in London at Covent Gardens and Oxford Street only specify our rent obligation for a five year period. The minimum rent obligation is then subject to review every five years. Included in the table above is an estimate of our rent obligation on these properties for the first five years. Amounts noted above include commitments for 27 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2007. (2) Pertains to store construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. 29 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description Total Amounts Committed Amount of Commitment Per Period (in thousands) Less Than One Year One to Three Years Four to Five Years More Than Five Years Line of credit (1) $ 30,606 $ 30,606 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 1,735 1,735 Total commercial commitments $ 32,341 $ 32,341 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2007, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any off balance sheet arrangements. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 could have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 could have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC staff published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) ratified its consensus on Issue No. 06 03, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be 30 Table of Contents Presented in the Income Statement. EITF 06 3 addresses what type of government assessments should be included within the scope of EITF 06 3, and how such government assessments should be presented in the income statement. The EITF concluded that the scope of EITF 06 3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes. In addition the EITF also concluded that the presentation of taxes, within the scope of EITF 06 3, on either a gross or net basis, is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 22, Disclosure of Accounting Policies. In addition, for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant. The EITF observed that because EITF 06 3 requires only the presentation of additional disclosures, an entity would not be required to re evaluate its existing policies related to taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer. EITF 06 3 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt the disclosure requirements of EITF 06 3 effective February 1, 2007, however, since we present revenue on a net basis, no further disclosure under EITF 06 3 will be required. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The new standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of FIN 48 is expected to result in adjustments to our tax contingency reserves and deferred income taxes which could be material, with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We have not completed our evaluation of FIN 48 nor measured its impact on our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. Fiscal 2007 Quarter Ended April 30, 2006 July 31, 2006 Oct. 31, 2006 Jan. 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 270,007 $ 285,559 $ 308,355 $ 360,796 Gross profit 96,768 104,752 117,948 132,453 Net income 20,299 25,662 34,514 35,731 Net income per common share basic 0.12 0.16 0.21 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.12 0.15 0.21 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 23 % 25 % 30 % Net income 17 % 22 % 30 % 31 % Fiscal 2006 Quarter Ended April 30, 2005 July 31, 2005 Oct. 31, 2005 Jan. 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 231,325 $ 253,392 $ 288,801 $ 318,589 Gross profit 97,617 104,836 120,251 125,902 Net income 27,440 30,601 37,162 35,593 Net income per common share basic 0.17 0.19 0.23 0.22 Net income per common share diluted 0.16 0.18 0.22 0.21 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 22 % 23 % 26 % 29 % Net income 21 % 23 % 29 % 27 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated AA or better, auction rate securities rated AA or better and money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not 32 Table of Contents have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.
