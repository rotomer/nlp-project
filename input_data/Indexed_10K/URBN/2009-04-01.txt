Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments: A leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and Leifsdottir, Anthropologies recently launched wholesale division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2009, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and website related sales and foreign currency translation adjustments are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2009 ended on January 31, 2009. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least 12 full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2009, we operated 142 Urban Outfitters stores of which 118 are located in the United States, 7 are located in Canada and 17 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2009, we opened 20 new Urban Outfitters stores, 12 of which are located within the United States, 3 of which are located in Canada, and 5 of which are located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urbans North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 35.9% and 6.2% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2009. 23 Table of Contents We operated 121 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2009, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2009 we opened 13 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, including opening Anthropologie stores in Europe. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 35.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. We operated 30 Free People stores as of January 31, 2009, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2009 we opened 15 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail sales accounted for approximately 1.8% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2009, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is our newest store concept designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants and flowers. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. Terrains sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 42 new stores during fiscal 2010, including approximately 9 new Free People stores and one new Terrain garden center. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Direct to consumer Anthropologie offers a direct to consumer catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2009, we circulated approximately 21.5 million catalogs and believe that our catalogs have been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to decrease circulation to approximately 18.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2010 and replace the reduced circulation spend with further investments in web marketing. We expect catalog circulation to be consistent over the next few years. Anthropologie operates a web site, www.anthropologie.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2009, we circulated approximately 12 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to maintain circulation of approximately 12 million catalogs during fiscal 2010 and continue to further invest in web marketing initiatives. We expect catalog circulation to be consistent over the next few years. 24 Table of Contents Urban Outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers, as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. In August 2006, Urban Outfitters launched a web site targeting our European customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk, captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution center located in the United Kingdom. We believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with our European customers as well as helps to support our Urban Outfitters European store operations. In October 2005, Free People introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering select merchandise most of which is also available in our Free People stores. During fiscal 2009, Free People circulated approximately 6.7 million catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand catalog circulation to approximately 7.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2010 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Free People also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site, www.freepeople.com, was launched in September 2004. The web site exposes consumers to the product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Free Peoples reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Free Peoples store operations. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 14.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,800 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5.8% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we launched Leifsdottir, the Anthropologie brands wholesale division. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel including dresses, tops and bottoms. Leifsdottir is sold through luxury department stores including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, select specialty stores and our own Anthropologie stores. Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. 25 Table of Contents Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service businesses accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits have not been material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and have not been material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2009 and 2008, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $7.5 million and $6.8 million, representing 2.7% and 2.3% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold to 26 Table of Contents maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent debt securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as long term have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as long term assets, any successful auctions would be classified as current assets. Marketable securities as of January 31, 2009 and 2008 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if required. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008 totaled $169.7 million and $171.9 million, representing 12.8% and 15.0% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2009 were performed as of June 2008 and January 2009. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and buildings, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost 27 Table of Contents and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008 totaled $505.4 million and $488.9 million, respectively, representing 38.0% and 42.8% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. We did not close any store locations in fiscal 2009. As of the date of this report, all of our stores opened in excess of three years are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008 totaled $46.3 million and $35.0 million, respectively, representing 3.5% and 3.1% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $1.4 million as of January 31, 2009 from $1.2 million as of January 31, 2008. This increase occurred based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. 28 Table of Contents Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 61.1 61.7 63.1 Gross profit 38.9 38.3 36.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.6 23.3 23.5 Income from operations 16.3 15.0 13.4 Interest income 0.6 0.6 0.5 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 16.9 15.6 13.9 Income tax expense 6.0 4.9 4.4 Net income 10.9 % 10.7 % 9.5 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 21.7 % 23.1 % 12.1 % Gross profit 23.7 % 27.6 % 0.7 % Income from operations 33.1 % 37.2 % (21.0 )% Net income 24.4 % 37.9 % (11.2 )% 29 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net sales in fiscal 2009 increased by 21.7% to $1.83 billion, from $1.51 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $327 million increase was primarily attributable to a $311 million or 22.0% increase, in retail segment sales. Our wholesale segment contributed $16 million to this increase for fiscal year 2009 as Free People wholesale net sales increased $13 million or 13.4%, excluding sales to our retail segment, and Leifsdottir contributed $3 million. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2009 was driven by an increase of $156 million in non comparable and new store net sales, an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $67 million or 32.4%, an increase to comparable store net sales of $88 million or 7.8%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of 3.4%, 4.1% and 11.9% increases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 and 38 new stores in fiscal 2008 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2009. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of increases in average unit sales prices and increases in transactions resulting from an increased response to our merchandise offerings. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in the number of units sold per transaction. Thus far during fiscal 2010 total Company sales are less than the same period in the prior year and our comparable store sales trend has declined from our most recently completed quarter. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2009 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset minor decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Circulation modestly increased by 688,000 catalogs or 1.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increased average unit sale prices and increased transactions. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2009 increased to 38.9% of net sales or $713 million from 38.3% of net sales or $577 million in fiscal 2008. This improvement is primarily due to leveraging of our store occupancy expenses and improvements in our initial merchandise margins which are partially offset by adjustments to record anticipated markdowns during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Total inventories at January 31, 2009 decreased by 1.3% to $170 million from $172 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to a 13% decrease in comparable store inventory which more than offset additions to inventories for new and non comparable stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 decreased to 22.6% of net sales versus 23.3% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The rate reduction is primarily due to controlling selling and store support related expenses in addition to lower corporate expenses resulting from non recurring legal fees incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 increased to $414 million from $352 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 15.0% of net sales or $225 million for fiscal 2008. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.6% of income for fiscal 2008. The increase in this years tax rate is due to the prior years annual effective tax rate being favorably impacted by the receipt of one time federal tax incentives for work performed on the development of our new home offices. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2010 to be similar to fiscal year 2009. 30 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net sales in fiscal 2008 increased by 23.1% to $1.51 billion, from $1.22 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $283 million increase was primarily attributable to a $263 million or 22.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Our wholesale segment contributed $20 million as Free People wholesale net sales increased 27.3%, excluding sales to our retail segment. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2008 was driven by an increase of $162 million or 42.8% in non comparable and new store net sales, an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $52 million or 33.8% and an increase to comparable store net sales of $49 million or 5.5%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of 12.8% and 18.4% increases at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively which more than offset a comparable store net sales decrease of 0.9% for fiscal year 2008 at Urban Outfitters. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 38 new stores in fiscal 2008 and 32 new stores in fiscal 2007 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2008. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of increases in average unit sales prices and increases in transactions resulting from an increased response to our merchandise offerings. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in the number of units sold per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, improved customer response related to the circulation of approximately 3.2 million additional catalogs, and improvements in the average order value. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by increased average unit sale prices and increased transactions. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2008 increased to 38.3% of net sales or $577 million from 36.9% of net sales or $452 million in fiscal 2007. This improvement is primarily due to a lower rate of merchandise markdowns and leveraging of our store occupancy expenses driven by the net increase in comparable store net sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2008 increased by 11.4% to $172 million from $154 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories decreased by 2.8% versus the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 decreased to 23.3% of net sales versus 23.5% of net sales for fiscal 2007. Rate reductions from controlling store support related expenses driven by increases in comparable store net sales was the primary contributor and more than offset non comparable expenses to operate our new home office facility. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 increased to $352 million from $288 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 15.0% of net sales or $225 million for fiscal 2008 compared to 13.4% of net sales or $164 million for fiscal 2007. Our annual effective income tax rate improved slightly to 31.6% of income for fiscal 2008 compared to 31.7% of income for fiscal 2007. These favorable rates are based upon a number of factors including: certification for work performed on the development of our new offices that qualified for certain one time federal tax incentives; the execution of certain related reorganization efforts in fiscal 2008 and 2007 as well as the relief of certain valuation allowances related to net operating loss carry forwards of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2007. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $521 million as of January 31, 2009 as compared to $374 million as of January 31, 2008 and $222 million as of January 31, 2007. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2009 occurred primarily as a result of adding $252 million from cash provided by operating activities, which primarily consists of net income. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2009 was $57 million of which $113 million was used for construction of new stores and was partially offset by the net activity of marketable securities. Cash from financing activities in fiscal 2009 of $22 million was related to exercises of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $483 million, $266 million and $231 million, respectively. The changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $109 million, $92 million and $193 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. In fiscal 2007, we substantially completed the construction of our home offices at the Navy Yard resulting in an additional $82 million of cash paid for property and equipment. During fiscal 2010, we plan to construct and open approximately 42 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, expand our Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Reno, Nevada distribution centers, decrease our catalog circulation by approximately 2 million catalogs to approximately 38 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to decrease the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 to approximately $110 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. Improvements to our home office and distribution facilities were necessary to adequately support our growth. During fiscal 2010, we may enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of the Terrain brand or other new concepts. We do not anticipate that these acquisitions or transactions individually or in the aggregate will be material. During fiscal 2010, we plan on substantially completing a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our midwest and east coast stores. We believe this expansion will support our growth for the next several years. During fiscal 2008, we entered into an operating lease for a warehouse facility in Reno, Nevada to support our western United States stores. The facility is approximately 176,000 square feet and the term of the lease is set to expire in 2017 with our option to renew for up to an additional 10 years. During fiscal 2008, we invested approximately $6.3 million in equipment and other improvements for this location. In March 2009, we executed a lease for an additional 39,000 square feet of warehouse space at our Reno, Nevada facility. We believe this expansion will support our growth for the next several years. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to 8,000,000 common shares from time to time, based upon prevailing 32 Table of Contents market conditions. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,220,000 shares at a cost of approximately $21 million. No shares were repurchased during fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2009. On December 11, 2007, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association (the Line). The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2009, the credit limit under the Line was $60.0 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of January 31, 2009, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $35.1 million as of January 31, 2009. The available credit, including the accordion feature under the Line was $64.9 million as of January 31, 2009. We believe the renewed Line will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal 2011. Wachovia Bank, National Association was acquired by Wells Fargo, effective January 1, 2009. The Wells Fargo acquisition does not affect the original line agreement. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2009: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,086,186 $ 132,497 $ 392,548 $ 232,231 $ 328,910 Purchase orders (2) 302,961 302,961 Construction contracts (3) 1,684 1,684 FIN 48 liability 381 381 Total contractual obligations $ 1,391,212 $ 437,523 $ 392,548 $ 232,231 $ 328,910 The contractual obligations table excludes our FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) liability of $10.7 million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. This amount was classified as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2009. The $0.4 million FIN 48 liability was classified as a current liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2009 and is shown in the above table. (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease 33 Table of Contents payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are seven locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these seven locations was approximately $1.1 million for fiscal 2009. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 34 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2009. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes store construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2009, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141R Business Combinations, which requires that all business combinations be accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any contingent consideration and contractual contingencies, as a whole at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Under SFAS No. 141R, all transaction costs are expensed as incurred. SFAS No. 141R rescinds EITF 93 7. Under EITF 93 7, the effect of any subsequent adjustments to uncertain tax positions were generally applied to goodwill, except for post acquisition interest on uncertain tax positions, which was recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense. Under SFAS No. 141R, all subsequent adjustments to these uncertain tax positions that otherwise would have impacted goodwill will be recognized in the income statement. The guidance in SFAS No. 141R will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the 34 Table of Contents acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the application of SFAS No. 141R to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Effective February 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 and have elected to not apply the provisions of SFAS No. 159 to report certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and for certain non financial assets and certain non financial liabilities in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Effective February 1, 2008, we have adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 that relate to our financial assets and financial liabilities (see Note 4). We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 157 that relate to our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which are effective for us as of February 1, 2009. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2009 Quarter Ended April 30,2008 July 31,2008 Oct. 31,2008 Jan. 31,2009 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 394,292 $ 454,295 $ 477,953 $ 508,078 Gross profit 158,680 186,510 195,396 172,892 Net income 42,557 56,988 59,274 40,545 Net income per common share basic 0.26 0.34 0.35 0.24 Net income per common share diluted 0.25 0.33 0.35 0.24 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Net income 21 % 29 % 30 % 20 % Fiscal 2008 Quarter Ended April 30,2007 July 31,2007 Oct. 31,2007 Jan. 31,2008 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 314,544 $ 348,449 $ 379,320 $ 465,411 Gross profit 112,615 130,027 149,938 184,192 Net income 29,367 31,866 45,382 53,616 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.19 0.27 0.32 Net income per common share diluted 0.17 0.19 0.27 0.32 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 23 % 25 % 31 % Net income 18 % 20 % 28 % 34 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2009 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, 36 Table of Contents tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, Federal Government Agencies, FDIC insured corporate bonds and auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 7% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated Auction Rate Securities (ARS) that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had a par value of $44.0 million and a fair value of $38.7 million as of January 31, 2009. As of January 31, 2009, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2008, the Company had $95.2 million of par and fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded a $5.3 million temporary impairment on our ARS as of January 31, 2009. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We have the ability to hold the investments until their maturity. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as long term assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments: A leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and Leifsdottir, Anthropologies recently launched wholesale division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2009, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and website related sales and foreign currency translation adjustments are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2009 ended on January 31, 2009. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least 12 full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Stores As of January 31, 2009, we operated 142 Urban Outfitters stores of which 118 are located in the United States, 7 are located in Canada and 17 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2009, we opened 20 new Urban Outfitters stores, 12 of which are located within the United States, 3 of which are located in Canada, and 5 of which are located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urbans North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 35.9% and 6.2% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2009. 23 Table of Contents We operated 121 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2009, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2009 we opened 13 new Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, including opening Anthropologie stores in Europe. Anthropologies store sales accounted for approximately 35.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. We operated 30 Free People stores as of January 31, 2009, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2009 we opened 15 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail sales accounted for approximately 1.8% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2009, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is our newest store concept designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants and flowers. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. Terrains sales accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 42 new stores during fiscal 2010, including approximately 9 new Free People stores and one new Terrain garden center. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Direct to consumer Anthropologie offers a direct to consumer catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2009, we circulated approximately 21.5 million catalogs and believe that our catalogs have been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to decrease circulation to approximately 18.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2010 and replace the reduced circulation spend with further investments in web marketing. We expect catalog circulation to be consistent over the next few years. Anthropologie operates a web site, www.anthropologie.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. In March 2003, Urban Outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2009, we circulated approximately 12 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to maintain circulation of approximately 12 million catalogs during fiscal 2010 and continue to further invest in web marketing initiatives. We expect catalog circulation to be consistent over the next few years. 24 Table of Contents Urban Outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, was launched in May 2000. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers, as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. In August 2006, Urban Outfitters launched a web site targeting our European customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk, captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution center located in the United Kingdom. We believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with our European customers as well as helps to support our Urban Outfitters European store operations. In October 2005, Free People introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering select merchandise most of which is also available in our Free People stores. During fiscal 2009, Free People circulated approximately 6.7 million catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand catalog circulation to approximately 7.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2010 and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years. Free People also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site, www.freepeople.com, was launched in September 2004. The web site exposes consumers to the product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Free Peoples reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Free Peoples store operations. Direct to consumer sales were approximately 14.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. Wholesale The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,800 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5.8% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we launched Leifsdottir, the Anthropologie brands wholesale division. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel including dresses, tops and bottoms. Leifsdottir is sold through luxury department stores including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, select specialty stores and our own Anthropologie stores. Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. 25 Table of Contents Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service businesses accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, have not been material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits have not been material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and have not been material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2009 and 2008, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $7.5 million and $6.8 million, representing 2.7% and 2.3% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold to 26 Table of Contents maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent debt securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as long term have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as long term assets, any successful auctions would be classified as current assets. Marketable securities as of January 31, 2009 and 2008 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if required. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008 totaled $169.7 million and $171.9 million, representing 12.8% and 15.0% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2009 were performed as of June 2008 and January 2009. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and buildings, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost 27 Table of Contents and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008 totaled $505.4 million and $488.9 million, respectively, representing 38.0% and 42.8% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. We did not close any store locations in fiscal 2009. As of the date of this report, all of our stores opened in excess of three years are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008 totaled $46.3 million and $35.0 million, respectively, representing 3.5% and 3.1% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $1.4 million as of January 31, 2009 from $1.2 million as of January 31, 2008. This increase occurred based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. 28 Table of Contents Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. SFAS No. 5 requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 61.1 61.7 63.1 Gross profit 38.9 38.3 36.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.6 23.3 23.5 Income from operations 16.3 15.0 13.4 Interest income 0.6 0.6 0.5 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 16.9 15.6 13.9 Income tax expense 6.0 4.9 4.4 Net income 10.9 % 10.7 % 9.5 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 21.7 % 23.1 % 12.1 % Gross profit 23.7 % 27.6 % 0.7 % Income from operations 33.1 % 37.2 % (21.0 )% Net income 24.4 % 37.9 % (11.2 )% 29 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net sales in fiscal 2009 increased by 21.7% to $1.83 billion, from $1.51 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $327 million increase was primarily attributable to a $311 million or 22.0% increase, in retail segment sales. Our wholesale segment contributed $16 million to this increase for fiscal year 2009 as Free People wholesale net sales increased $13 million or 13.4%, excluding sales to our retail segment, and Leifsdottir contributed $3 million. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2009 was driven by an increase of $156 million in non comparable and new store net sales, an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $67 million or 32.4%, an increase to comparable store net sales of $88 million or 7.8%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of 3.4%, 4.1% and 11.9% increases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 and 38 new stores in fiscal 2008 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2009. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of increases in average unit sales prices and increases in transactions resulting from an increased response to our merchandise offerings. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in the number of units sold per transaction. Thus far during fiscal 2010 total Company sales are less than the same period in the prior year and our comparable store sales trend has declined from our most recently completed quarter. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2009 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset minor decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Circulation modestly increased by 688,000 catalogs or 1.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increased average unit sale prices and increased transactions. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2009 increased to 38.9% of net sales or $713 million from 38.3% of net sales or $577 million in fiscal 2008. This improvement is primarily due to leveraging of our store occupancy expenses and improvements in our initial merchandise margins which are partially offset by adjustments to record anticipated markdowns during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Total inventories at January 31, 2009 decreased by 1.3% to $170 million from $172 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to a 13% decrease in comparable store inventory which more than offset additions to inventories for new and non comparable stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 decreased to 22.6% of net sales versus 23.3% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The rate reduction is primarily due to controlling selling and store support related expenses in addition to lower corporate expenses resulting from non recurring legal fees incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 increased to $414 million from $352 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 15.0% of net sales or $225 million for fiscal 2008. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.6% of income for fiscal 2008. The increase in this years tax rate is due to the prior years annual effective tax rate being favorably impacted by the receipt of one time federal tax incentives for work performed on the development of our new home offices. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2010 to be similar to fiscal year 2009. 30 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net sales in fiscal 2008 increased by 23.1% to $1.51 billion, from $1.22 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $283 million increase was primarily attributable to a $263 million or 22.8% increase, in retail segment sales. Our wholesale segment contributed $20 million as Free People wholesale net sales increased 27.3%, excluding sales to our retail segment. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2008 was driven by an increase of $162 million or 42.8% in non comparable and new store net sales, an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $52 million or 33.8% and an increase to comparable store net sales of $49 million or 5.5%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of 12.8% and 18.4% increases at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively which more than offset a comparable store net sales decrease of 0.9% for fiscal year 2008 at Urban Outfitters. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 38 new stores in fiscal 2008 and 32 new stores in fiscal 2007 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2008. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of increases in average unit sales prices and increases in transactions resulting from an increased response to our merchandise offerings. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in the number of units sold per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, improved customer response related to the circulation of approximately 3.2 million additional catalogs, and improvements in the average order value. The increase in Free People wholesale sales was driven by increased average unit sale prices and increased transactions. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2008 increased to 38.3% of net sales or $577 million from 36.9% of net sales or $452 million in fiscal 2007. This improvement is primarily due to a lower rate of merchandise markdowns and leveraging of our store occupancy expenses driven by the net increase in comparable store net sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2008 increased by 11.4% to $172 million from $154 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores. On a comparable store basis, inventories decreased by 2.8% versus the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 decreased to 23.3% of net sales versus 23.5% of net sales for fiscal 2007. Rate reductions from controlling store support related expenses driven by increases in comparable store net sales was the primary contributor and more than offset non comparable expenses to operate our new home office facility. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 increased to $352 million from $288 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 15.0% of net sales or $225 million for fiscal 2008 compared to 13.4% of net sales or $164 million for fiscal 2007. Our annual effective income tax rate improved slightly to 31.6% of income for fiscal 2008 compared to 31.7% of income for fiscal 2007. These favorable rates are based upon a number of factors including: certification for work performed on the development of our new offices that qualified for certain one time federal tax incentives; the execution of certain related reorganization efforts in fiscal 2008 and 2007 as well as the relief of certain valuation allowances related to net operating loss carry forwards of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2007. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $521 million as of January 31, 2009 as compared to $374 million as of January 31, 2008 and $222 million as of January 31, 2007. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2009 occurred primarily as a result of adding $252 million from cash provided by operating activities, which primarily consists of net income. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2009 was $57 million of which $113 million was used for construction of new stores and was partially offset by the net activity of marketable securities. Cash from financing activities in fiscal 2009 of $22 million was related to exercises of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $483 million, $266 million and $231 million, respectively. The changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $109 million, $92 million and $193 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. In fiscal 2007, we substantially completed the construction of our home offices at the Navy Yard resulting in an additional $82 million of cash paid for property and equipment. During fiscal 2010, we plan to construct and open approximately 42 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, expand our Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Reno, Nevada distribution centers, decrease our catalog circulation by approximately 2 million catalogs to approximately 38 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to decrease the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 to approximately $110 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. Improvements to our home office and distribution facilities were necessary to adequately support our growth. During fiscal 2010, we may enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of the Terrain brand or other new concepts. We do not anticipate that these acquisitions or transactions individually or in the aggregate will be material. During fiscal 2010, we plan on substantially completing a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our midwest and east coast stores. We believe this expansion will support our growth for the next several years. During fiscal 2008, we entered into an operating lease for a warehouse facility in Reno, Nevada to support our western United States stores. The facility is approximately 176,000 square feet and the term of the lease is set to expire in 2017 with our option to renew for up to an additional 10 years. During fiscal 2008, we invested approximately $6.3 million in equipment and other improvements for this location. In March 2009, we executed a lease for an additional 39,000 square feet of warehouse space at our Reno, Nevada facility. We believe this expansion will support our growth for the next several years. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to 8,000,000 common shares from time to time, based upon prevailing 32 Table of Contents market conditions. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,220,000 shares at a cost of approximately $21 million. No shares were repurchased during fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2009. On December 11, 2007, we renewed and amended our line of credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association (the Line). The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2009, the credit limit under the Line was $60.0 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of January 31, 2009, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $35.1 million as of January 31, 2009. The available credit, including the accordion feature under the Line was $64.9 million as of January 31, 2009. We believe the renewed Line will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal 2011. Wachovia Bank, National Association was acquired by Wells Fargo, effective January 1, 2009. The Wells Fargo acquisition does not affect the original line agreement. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2009: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,086,186 $ 132,497 $ 392,548 $ 232,231 $ 328,910 Purchase orders (2) 302,961 302,961 Construction contracts (3) 1,684 1,684 FIN 48 liability 381 381 Total contractual obligations $ 1,391,212 $ 437,523 $ 392,548 $ 232,231 $ 328,910 The contractual obligations table excludes our FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) liability of $10.7 million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. This amount was classified as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2009. The $0.4 million FIN 48 liability was classified as a current liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2009 and is shown in the above table. (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease 33 Table of Contents payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are seven locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these seven locations was approximately $1.1 million for fiscal 2009. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 34 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2009. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes store construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2009, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141R Business Combinations, which requires that all business combinations be accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the acquirer recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any contingent consideration and contractual contingencies, as a whole at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Under SFAS No. 141R, all transaction costs are expensed as incurred. SFAS No. 141R rescinds EITF 93 7. Under EITF 93 7, the effect of any subsequent adjustments to uncertain tax positions were generally applied to goodwill, except for post acquisition interest on uncertain tax positions, which was recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense. Under SFAS No. 141R, all subsequent adjustments to these uncertain tax positions that otherwise would have impacted goodwill will be recognized in the income statement. The guidance in SFAS No. 141R will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the 34 Table of Contents acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the application of SFAS No. 141R to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Effective February 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 and have elected to not apply the provisions of SFAS No. 159 to report certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and for certain non financial assets and certain non financial liabilities in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Effective February 1, 2008, we have adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 that relate to our financial assets and financial liabilities (see Note 4). We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 157 that relate to our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which are effective for us as of February 1, 2009. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2009 Quarter Ended April 30,2008 July 31,2008 Oct. 31,2008 Jan. 31,2009 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 394,292 $ 454,295 $ 477,953 $ 508,078 Gross profit 158,680 186,510 195,396 172,892 Net income 42,557 56,988 59,274 40,545 Net income per common share basic 0.26 0.34 0.35 0.24 Net income per common share diluted 0.25 0.33 0.35 0.24 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Net income 21 % 29 % 30 % 20 % Fiscal 2008 Quarter Ended April 30,2007 July 31,2007 Oct. 31,2007 Jan. 31,2008 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 314,544 $ 348,449 $ 379,320 $ 465,411 Gross profit 112,615 130,027 149,938 184,192 Net income 29,367 31,866 45,382 53,616 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.19 0.27 0.32 Net income per common share diluted 0.17 0.19 0.27 0.32 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 23 % 25 % 31 % Net income 18 % 20 % 28 % 34 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2009 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, 36 Table of Contents tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, Federal Government Agencies, FDIC insured corporate bonds and auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 7% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated Auction Rate Securities (ARS) that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had a par value of $44.0 million and a fair value of $38.7 million as of January 31, 2009. As of January 31, 2009, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2008, the Company had $95.2 million of par and fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded a $5.3 million temporary impairment on our ARS as of January 31, 2009. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We have the ability to hold the investments until their maturity. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as long term assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments.
