Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources, were necessary to adequately support our growth. We believe we may need to further expand the square footage of our home office and distribution facilities to support our growth over the next several years. For more information on our distribution center properties, see Item 1: Business Company Operations Distribution. We believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition. 16 Table of Contents All of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain stores are leased, well maintained and in good operating condition. Our retail stores are typically leased for a term of ten years with renewal options for an additional five to ten years. Total estimated selling square feet for stores open, under lease at January 31, 2010, by Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain was approximately 1,234,000, 1,000,000, 47,000 and 20,000, respectively. Terrain also utilizes two acres of outdoor space to sell seasonal, live plants, accessories and outdoor furniture. The average store selling square feet is approximately 9,000 for Urban Outfitters, 7,400 for Anthropologie and 1,400 for Free People. Selling square feet can sometimes change due to floor moves, use of staircases, cash register configuration and other factors.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and our Leifsdottir division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2010, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and website related sales and foreign currency translation adjustments are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2010 ended on January 31, 2010. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Store As of January 31, 2010, we operated 155 Urban Outfitters stores of which 130 are located in the United States, 7 are located in Canada and 18 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2010, we opened 13 new Urban Outfitters stores, 12 of which are located within the United States and 1 which is located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urbans North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 33.7% and 5.5% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2010. We operated 137 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2010, of which 133 are located in the United States, 3 are located in Canada and 1 is located in Europe. During fiscal 2010 we opened 16 new Anthropologie stores, of which 12 are located within the United States, 3 are located in Canada, 23 Table of Contents and 1 is located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, including opening additional Anthropologie stores in Europe. Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 36.1% and 0.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. We operated 34 Free People stores as of January 31, 2010, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2010 we opened 4 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2010, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is our newest store concept designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment through its large and freestanding site, inspired by the greenhouse. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. Terrain store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 45 new stores during fiscal 2011, including approximately 9 new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Direct to Consumer Anthropologie offers a direct to consumer catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2010, we circulated approximately 17.4 million catalogs and believe that our catalogs have been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 18.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. Anthropologie operates a web site, www.anthropologie.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. Urban Outfitters offers a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2010, we circulated approximately 12.1 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 13.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. 24 Table of Contents Urban Outfitters operates a web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers, as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. Urban Outfitters also operates a web site targeting our European customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk, captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution center located in the United Kingdom. We believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with our European customers as well as helps to support our Urban Outfitters European store operations. Free People offers a direct to consumer catalog offering select merchandise most of which is also available in our Free People stores. During fiscal 2010, Free People circulated approximately 7.4 million catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand catalog circulation to approximately 8.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. Free People operates a web site, www.freepeople.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site exposes consumers to the product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Free Peoples reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Free Peoples store operations. Terrain operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site, www.shopterrain.com, was launched in September 2009. The web site exposes consumers to a portion of the product assortment found at the Terrain retail store. We believe that the web site increases Terrains reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Terrains store operations. Increases in our catalog circulation are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our direct to consumer customers to determine which customers who respond to our catalog mailings. We also utilize the services of list rental companies to identify potential customers that will receive future catalogs. We plan on increasing our spending on investments in web marketing for Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People in fiscal 2011. These increases will be based on our ongoing daily evaluation of the customers response rate to our marketing investments. Direct to consumer sales for all brands combined were approximately 16.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. Wholesale Operations The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. During fiscal 2010, Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including 25 Table of Contents Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 4.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. The Leifsdottir wholesale division was established in fiscal 2009. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel including dresses, tops and bottoms. Leifsdottir is sold through luxury department stores including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, select specialty stores and our own Anthropologie stores. Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer at which time we record the redemption of the 26 Table of Contents card for merchandise as a sale or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2010 and 2009, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $9.9 million and $7.5 million, representing 2.9% and 2.7% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent debt securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses, as defined by ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities, are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as long term have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as long term assets. Successful auctions would be classified as current assets. Marketable securities as of January 31, 2010 and 2009 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable 27 Table of Contents values, if required. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $186.1 million and $169.7 million, representing 11.4% and 12.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2010 were performed as of June 2009 and January 2010. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $540.0 million and $505.4 million, respectively, representing 33.0% and 38.0% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. In January of fiscal 2010 we converted one Free People store location in Chicago to a Free People Wholesale Showroom. As of the date of this report, all of our stores are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. 28 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $43.6 million and $46.3 million, respectively, representing 2.7% and 3.5% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.2 million as of January 31, 2010 from $1.4 million as of January 31, 2009. This increase is based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 59.4 61.1 61.7 Gross profit 40.6 38.9 38.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.1 22.6 23.3 Income from operations 17.5 16.3 15.0 Interest income 0.3 0.6 0.6 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 17.8 16.9 15.6 Income tax expense 6.4 6.0 4.9 Net income 11.4 % 10.9 % 10.7 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 5.6 % 21.7 % 23.1 % Gross profit 10.2 % 23.7 % 27.6 % Income from operations 13.2 % 33.1 % 37.2 % Net income 10.3 % 24.4 % 37.9 % Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 5.6% to $1.94 billion, from $1.83 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $103 million increase was attributable to a $109 million or 6.3% increase, in retail segment net sales that was partially offset by a $6 million or 5.4% decline in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2010 was driven by an increase of $115 million in non comparable and new store net sales, and an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $53 million or 19.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $35 million or 2.6% in comparable store net sales and $24 million of foreign currency translation adjustments. The decrease in comparable store net sales was comprised of 0.6%, 11.0% and 4.0% decreases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The decline in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $11 million or 10.6% decline at Free People wholesale that was partially offset by an increase of $5 million or 185% at Leifsdottir. 30 Table of Contents The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 and 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2010. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of decreases in the number of units sold per transaction, that were partially offset by slight increases in average unit sales prices and transactions. Thus far during fiscal 2011 total Company net sales are favorable versus the same period in the prior year and our comparable retail segment sales trend has improved significantly from our most recently completed quarter. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Catalog circulation across all brands decreased by 3 million or 8.2%. The decrease in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by decreases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottir wholesale net sales increase was a result of increased transactions that more than offset a decline in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2010 increased to 40.6% of net sales or $786 million from 38.9% of net sales or $713 million in fiscal 2009. This improvement is primarily due to improvements in our initial merchandise margins which were partially offset by a higher rate of store occupancy expense driven by the decrease in comparable store sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2010 increased by $16 million or 9.7% to $186 million from $170 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non comparable stores. Comparable store inventory at cost decreased by 3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 increased to 23.1% of net sales or $447 million versus 22.6% of net sales or $414 million for fiscal 2009. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in incentive based compensation that relates to meeting targeted operating performance goals in fiscal 2010. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 17.5% of net sales or $339 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 36.2% of income for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010s tax rate is primarily due to a lower proportion of tax free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior years holdings. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be favorable to fiscal 2010 due in part to an anticipated increase in income generated from foreign operations. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net sales in fiscal 2009 increased by 21.7% to $1.83 billion, from $1.51 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $327 million increase was primarily attributable to a $311 million or 22.0% increase, in retail segment sales. Our wholesale segment contributed $16 million to this increase for fiscal year 2009 as Free People wholesale net sales increased $13 million or 13.4%, excluding sales to our retail segment, and Leifsdottir contributed $3 million. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2009 was driven by an increase of $156 million in non comparable and new store net sales, an increase 31 Table of Contents in direct to consumer net sales of $67 million or 32.4%, an increase to comparable store net sales of $88 million or 7.8%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of 3.4%, 4.1% and 11.9% increases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 and 38 new stores in fiscal 2008 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2009. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of increases in average unit sales prices and increases in transactions resulting from an increased response to our merchandise offerings. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in the number of units sold per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2009 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, that more than offset minor decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Circulation modestly increased by 688,000 catalogs or 1.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increased average unit sale prices and increased transactions. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2009 increased to 38.9% of net sales or $713 million from 38.3% of net sales or $577 million in fiscal 2008. This improvement is primarily due to leveraging of our store occupancy expenses and improvements in our initial merchandise margins which are partially offset by adjustments to record anticipated markdowns during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Total inventories at January 31, 2009 decreased by 1.3% to $170 million from $172 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to a 13% decrease in comparable store inventory which more than offset additions to inventories for new and non comparable stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 decreased to 22.6% of net sales versus 23.3% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The rate reduction is primarily due to controlling selling and store support related expenses in addition to lower corporate expenses resulting from non recurring legal fees incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 increased to $414 million from $352 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 15.0% of net sales or $225 million for fiscal 2008. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.6% of income for fiscal 2008. The increase in this years tax rate is due to the prior years annual effective tax rate being favorably impacted by the receipt of one time federal tax incentives for work performed on the development of our new home offices. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $745 million as of January 31, 2010 as compared to $521 million as of January 31, 2009 and $374 million as of January 31, 2008. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2010 was primarily a result of $325 million from cash provided by operating activities as compared to $252 million in fiscal 2009, that primarily consists of net income and the add back of the non cash items, depreciation and 32 Table of Contents amortization expense. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2010 was $495 million of which $109 million was used primarily for the construction of new stores and $386 million was the net activity used for purchases and sales of marketable securities. Cash from financing activities in fiscal 2010 of $10 million was related to exercises of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $618 million, $483 million and $266 million, respectively. The changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $109 million, $109 million and $92 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2011, we plan to construct and open approximately 45 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, complete an expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, modestly increase our catalog circulation by approximately 3 million catalogs to approximately 40 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 to approximately $130 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. During fiscal 2011, we plan to complete a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We anticipate the project will cost approximately $25 million. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. During fiscal 2010, we completed a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our midwest and east coast stores. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. During fiscal 2008, we entered into an operating lease for a warehouse facility in Reno, Nevada to support our western United States stores. The facility is approximately 214,500 square feet and the term of the lease is set to expire in 2017 with our option to renew for up to an additional 10 years. During fiscal 2008, we invested approximately $6.3 million in equipment and other improvements for this location. In March 2009, we executed a lease for an additional 39,000 square feet of warehouse space at our Reno, Nevada facility that is included in the total noted above. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the next several years. During fiscal 2011, we may enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. We do not anticipate that these acquisitions or transactions individually or in the aggregate will be material to our financial statements as a whole. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to 8,000,000 common shares from time to time, based upon prevailing market conditions. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,220,000 shares at a cost of approximately $21 million. No shares have been repurchased since fiscal 2007. 33 Table of Contents On September 21, 2009, we amended our renewed and amended line of credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association (the Line). This amendment adds additional subsidiary borrowers and adds certain additional subsidiary guarantors. The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2010, the credit limit under the Line was $60.0 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of January 31, 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of January 31, 2010, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $36.3 million as of January 31, 2010. The available credit, including the accordion feature under the Line was $63.7 million as of January 31, 2010. We believe the renewed Line will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal 2011. We plan to renew the line during fiscal 2011 and expect the renewal will satisfy our credit needs through fiscal 2011 and the foreseeable future. Wachovia Bank, National Association was acquired by Wells Fargo, effective January 1, 2009. The Wells Fargo acquisition did not affect the original line agreement. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2010: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,155,843 $ 139,562 $ 421,370 $ 242,101 $ 352,810 Purchase orders (2) 221,985 221,985 Construction contracts (3) 2,893 2,893 Tax Contingencies (4) 710 710 Total contractual obligations $ 1,381,431 $ 365,150 $ 421,370 $ 242,101 $ 352,810 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 22 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 22 locations was approximately $3.3 million for fiscal 2010. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 22 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2010. 34 Table of Contents (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $0.7 million that are classified as a current liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2010. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10.0 million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. The $10.0 is classified as a long term liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2010. Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 32,349 $ 32,349 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 3,932 3,932 Total commercial commitments $ 36,281 $ 36,281 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2010, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) which was codified into The Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810. This standard responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the involvement with variable interest entities. Specifically, ASC Topic 810 requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In addition, the standard requires additional disclosures about the involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. The provisions of ASC Topic 810 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. We plan to adopt these provisions in fiscal 2011 and anticipate the adoption to have no effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended April 30,2009 July 31,2009 Oct. 31,2009 Jan. 31,2010 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 384,796 $ 458,626 $ 505,900 $ 588,493 Gross profit 143,305 187,091 210,088 245,661 Net income 30,805 49,021 62,392 77,675 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.29 0.37 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.18 0.29 0.36 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 24 % 26 % 30 % Net income 14 % 22 % 29 % 35 % Fiscal 2009 Quarter Ended April 30,2008 July 31,2008 Oct. 31,2008 Jan. 31,2009 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 394,292 $ 454,295 $ 477,953 $ 508,078 Gross profit 158,680 186,510 195,396 172,892 Net income 42,557 56,988 59,274 40,545 Net income per common share basic 0.26 0.34 0.35 0.24 Net income per common share diluted 0.25 0.33 0.35 0.24 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Net income 21 % 29 % 30 % 20 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2010 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, 36 Table of Contents Federal Government Agencies, FDIC insured corporate bonds, pre refunded tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, and auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 4.5% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated ARS that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had a par value of $37.6 million and a fair value of $33.5 million as of January 31, 2010. As of January 31, 2010, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2009, the Company had $44.0 million of par and 38.7 million of fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $4.1 million and $5.3 million of temporary impairment charges on our ARS as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe it is not likely to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as long term assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments. 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this report. The results of operations for past accounting periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future accounting period.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and our Leifsdottir division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2010, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and website related sales and foreign currency translation adjustments are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2010 ended on January 31, 2010. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Store As of January 31, 2010, we operated 155 Urban Outfitters stores of which 130 are located in the United States, 7 are located in Canada and 18 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2010, we opened 13 new Urban Outfitters stores, 12 of which are located within the United States and 1 which is located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urbans North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 33.7% and 5.5% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2010. We operated 137 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2010, of which 133 are located in the United States, 3 are located in Canada and 1 is located in Europe. During fiscal 2010 we opened 16 new Anthropologie stores, of which 12 are located within the United States, 3 are located in Canada, 23 Table of Contents and 1 is located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, including opening additional Anthropologie stores in Europe. Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 36.1% and 0.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. We operated 34 Free People stores as of January 31, 2010, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2010 we opened 4 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2010, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is our newest store concept designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment through its large and freestanding site, inspired by the greenhouse. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. Terrain store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 45 new stores during fiscal 2011, including approximately 9 new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Direct to Consumer Anthropologie offers a direct to consumer catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2010, we circulated approximately 17.4 million catalogs and believe that our catalogs have been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 18.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. Anthropologie operates a web site, www.anthropologie.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. Urban Outfitters offers a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2010, we circulated approximately 12.1 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 13.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. 24 Table of Contents Urban Outfitters operates a web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers, as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. Urban Outfitters also operates a web site targeting our European customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk, captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution center located in the United Kingdom. We believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with our European customers as well as helps to support our Urban Outfitters European store operations. Free People offers a direct to consumer catalog offering select merchandise most of which is also available in our Free People stores. During fiscal 2010, Free People circulated approximately 7.4 million catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand catalog circulation to approximately 8.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. Free People operates a web site, www.freepeople.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site exposes consumers to the product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Free Peoples reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Free Peoples store operations. Terrain operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site, www.shopterrain.com, was launched in September 2009. The web site exposes consumers to a portion of the product assortment found at the Terrain retail store. We believe that the web site increases Terrains reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Terrains store operations. Increases in our catalog circulation are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our direct to consumer customers to determine which customers who respond to our catalog mailings. We also utilize the services of list rental companies to identify potential customers that will receive future catalogs. We plan on increasing our spending on investments in web marketing for Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People in fiscal 2011. These increases will be based on our ongoing daily evaluation of the customers response rate to our marketing investments. Direct to consumer sales for all brands combined were approximately 16.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. Wholesale Operations The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. During fiscal 2010, Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including 25 Table of Contents Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 4.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. The Leifsdottir wholesale division was established in fiscal 2009. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel including dresses, tops and bottoms. Leifsdottir is sold through luxury department stores including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, select specialty stores and our own Anthropologie stores. Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer at which time we record the redemption of the 26 Table of Contents card for merchandise as a sale or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2010 and 2009, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $9.9 million and $7.5 million, representing 2.9% and 2.7% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent debt securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses, as defined by ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities, are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as long term have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as long term assets. Successful auctions would be classified as current assets. Marketable securities as of January 31, 2010 and 2009 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable 27 Table of Contents values, if required. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $186.1 million and $169.7 million, representing 11.4% and 12.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2010 were performed as of June 2009 and January 2010. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $540.0 million and $505.4 million, respectively, representing 33.0% and 38.0% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. In January of fiscal 2010 we converted one Free People store location in Chicago to a Free People Wholesale Showroom. As of the date of this report, all of our stores are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. 28 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $43.6 million and $46.3 million, respectively, representing 2.7% and 3.5% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.2 million as of January 31, 2010 from $1.4 million as of January 31, 2009. This increase is based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 59.4 61.1 61.7 Gross profit 40.6 38.9 38.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.1 22.6 23.3 Income from operations 17.5 16.3 15.0 Interest income 0.3 0.6 0.6 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 17.8 16.9 15.6 Income tax expense 6.4 6.0 4.9 Net income 11.4 % 10.9 % 10.7 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 5.6 % 21.7 % 23.1 % Gross profit 10.2 % 23.7 % 27.6 % Income from operations 13.2 % 33.1 % 37.2 % Net income 10.3 % 24.4 % 37.9 % Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 5.6% to $1.94 billion, from $1.83 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $103 million increase was attributable to a $109 million or 6.3% increase, in retail segment net sales that was partially offset by a $6 million or 5.4% decline in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2010 was driven by an increase of $115 million in non comparable and new store net sales, and an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $53 million or 19.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $35 million or 2.6% in comparable store net sales and $24 million of foreign currency translation adjustments. The decrease in comparable store net sales was comprised of 0.6%, 11.0% and 4.0% decreases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The decline in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $11 million or 10.6% decline at Free People wholesale that was partially offset by an increase of $5 million or 185% at Leifsdottir. 30 Table of Contents The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 and 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2010. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of decreases in the number of units sold per transaction, that were partially offset by slight increases in average unit sales prices and transactions. Thus far during fiscal 2011 total Company net sales are favorable versus the same period in the prior year and our comparable retail segment sales trend has improved significantly from our most recently completed quarter. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Catalog circulation across all brands decreased by 3 million or 8.2%. The decrease in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by decreases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottir wholesale net sales increase was a result of increased transactions that more than offset a decline in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2010 increased to 40.6% of net sales or $786 million from 38.9% of net sales or $713 million in fiscal 2009. This improvement is primarily due to improvements in our initial merchandise margins which were partially offset by a higher rate of store occupancy expense driven by the decrease in comparable store sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2010 increased by $16 million or 9.7% to $186 million from $170 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non comparable stores. Comparable store inventory at cost decreased by 3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 increased to 23.1% of net sales or $447 million versus 22.6% of net sales or $414 million for fiscal 2009. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in incentive based compensation that relates to meeting targeted operating performance goals in fiscal 2010. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 17.5% of net sales or $339 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 36.2% of income for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010s tax rate is primarily due to a lower proportion of tax free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior years holdings. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be favorable to fiscal 2010 due in part to an anticipated increase in income generated from foreign operations. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net sales in fiscal 2009 increased by 21.7% to $1.83 billion, from $1.51 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $327 million increase was primarily attributable to a $311 million or 22.0% increase, in retail segment sales. Our wholesale segment contributed $16 million to this increase for fiscal year 2009 as Free People wholesale net sales increased $13 million or 13.4%, excluding sales to our retail segment, and Leifsdottir contributed $3 million. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2009 was driven by an increase of $156 million in non comparable and new store net sales, an increase 31 Table of Contents in direct to consumer net sales of $67 million or 32.4%, an increase to comparable store net sales of $88 million or 7.8%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of 3.4%, 4.1% and 11.9% increases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 and 38 new stores in fiscal 2008 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2009. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of increases in average unit sales prices and increases in transactions resulting from an increased response to our merchandise offerings. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in the number of units sold per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2009 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, that more than offset minor decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Circulation modestly increased by 688,000 catalogs or 1.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increased average unit sale prices and increased transactions. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2009 increased to 38.9% of net sales or $713 million from 38.3% of net sales or $577 million in fiscal 2008. This improvement is primarily due to leveraging of our store occupancy expenses and improvements in our initial merchandise margins which are partially offset by adjustments to record anticipated markdowns during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Total inventories at January 31, 2009 decreased by 1.3% to $170 million from $172 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to a 13% decrease in comparable store inventory which more than offset additions to inventories for new and non comparable stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 decreased to 22.6% of net sales versus 23.3% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The rate reduction is primarily due to controlling selling and store support related expenses in addition to lower corporate expenses resulting from non recurring legal fees incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 increased to $414 million from $352 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 15.0% of net sales or $225 million for fiscal 2008. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.6% of income for fiscal 2008. The increase in this years tax rate is due to the prior years annual effective tax rate being favorably impacted by the receipt of one time federal tax incentives for work performed on the development of our new home offices. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $745 million as of January 31, 2010 as compared to $521 million as of January 31, 2009 and $374 million as of January 31, 2008. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2010 was primarily a result of $325 million from cash provided by operating activities as compared to $252 million in fiscal 2009, that primarily consists of net income and the add back of the non cash items, depreciation and 32 Table of Contents amortization expense. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2010 was $495 million of which $109 million was used primarily for the construction of new stores and $386 million was the net activity used for purchases and sales of marketable securities. Cash from financing activities in fiscal 2010 of $10 million was related to exercises of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $618 million, $483 million and $266 million, respectively. The changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $109 million, $109 million and $92 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2011, we plan to construct and open approximately 45 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, complete an expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, modestly increase our catalog circulation by approximately 3 million catalogs to approximately 40 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 to approximately $130 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. During fiscal 2011, we plan to complete a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We anticipate the project will cost approximately $25 million. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. During fiscal 2010, we completed a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our midwest and east coast stores. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. During fiscal 2008, we entered into an operating lease for a warehouse facility in Reno, Nevada to support our western United States stores. The facility is approximately 214,500 square feet and the term of the lease is set to expire in 2017 with our option to renew for up to an additional 10 years. During fiscal 2008, we invested approximately $6.3 million in equipment and other improvements for this location. In March 2009, we executed a lease for an additional 39,000 square feet of warehouse space at our Reno, Nevada facility that is included in the total noted above. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the next several years. During fiscal 2011, we may enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. We do not anticipate that these acquisitions or transactions individually or in the aggregate will be material to our financial statements as a whole. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to 8,000,000 common shares from time to time, based upon prevailing market conditions. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,220,000 shares at a cost of approximately $21 million. No shares have been repurchased since fiscal 2007. 33 Table of Contents On September 21, 2009, we amended our renewed and amended line of credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association (the Line). This amendment adds additional subsidiary borrowers and adds certain additional subsidiary guarantors. The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2010, the credit limit under the Line was $60.0 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of January 31, 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of January 31, 2010, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $36.3 million as of January 31, 2010. The available credit, including the accordion feature under the Line was $63.7 million as of January 31, 2010. We believe the renewed Line will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal 2011. We plan to renew the line during fiscal 2011 and expect the renewal will satisfy our credit needs through fiscal 2011 and the foreseeable future. Wachovia Bank, National Association was acquired by Wells Fargo, effective January 1, 2009. The Wells Fargo acquisition did not affect the original line agreement. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2010: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,155,843 $ 139,562 $ 421,370 $ 242,101 $ 352,810 Purchase orders (2) 221,985 221,985 Construction contracts (3) 2,893 2,893 Tax Contingencies (4) 710 710 Total contractual obligations $ 1,381,431 $ 365,150 $ 421,370 $ 242,101 $ 352,810 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 22 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 22 locations was approximately $3.3 million for fiscal 2010. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 22 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2010. 34 Table of Contents (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $0.7 million that are classified as a current liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2010. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10.0 million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. The $10.0 is classified as a long term liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2010.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2010, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) which was codified into The Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810. This standard responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the involvement with variable interest entities. Specifically, ASC Topic 810 requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In addition, the standard requires additional disclosures about the involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. The provisions of ASC Topic 810 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. We plan to adopt these provisions in fiscal 2011 and anticipate the adoption to have no effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended April 30,2009 July 31,2009 Oct. 31,2009 Jan. 31,2010 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 384,796 $ 458,626 $ 505,900 $ 588,493 Gross profit 143,305 187,091 210,088 245,661 Net income 30,805 49,021 62,392 77,675 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.29 0.37 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.18 0.29 0.36 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 24 % 26 % 30 % Net income 14 % 22 % 29 % 35 % Fiscal 2009 Quarter Ended April 30,2008 July 31,2008 Oct. 31,2008 Jan. 31,2009 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 394,292 $ 454,295 $ 477,953 $ 508,078 Gross profit 158,680 186,510 195,396 172,892 Net income 42,557 56,988 59,274 40,545 Net income per common share basic 0.26 0.34 0.35 0.24 Net income per common share diluted 0.25 0.33 0.35 0.24 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Net income 21 % 29 % 30 % 20 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2010 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, 36 Table of Contents Federal Government Agencies, FDIC insured corporate bonds, pre refunded tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, and auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 4.5% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated ARS that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had a par value of $37.6 million and a fair value of $33.5 million as of January 31, 2010. As of January 31, 2010, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2009, the Company had $44.0 million of par and 38.7 million of fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $4.1 million and $5.3 million of temporary impairment charges on our ARS as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe it is not likely to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as long term assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and our Leifsdottir division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. A store is included in comparable store net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal 2010, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. Sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable. Furthermore, non store sales, such as catalog and website related sales and foreign currency translation adjustments are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2010 ended on January 31, 2010. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Store As of January 31, 2010, we operated 155 Urban Outfitters stores of which 130 are located in the United States, 7 are located in Canada and 18 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2010, we opened 13 new Urban Outfitters stores, 12 of which are located within the United States and 1 which is located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Our product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urbans North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 33.7% and 5.5% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2010. We operated 137 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2010, of which 133 are located in the United States, 3 are located in Canada and 1 is located in Europe. During fiscal 2010 we opened 16 new Anthropologie stores, of which 12 are located within the United States, 3 are located in Canada, 23 Table of Contents and 1 is located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 30 to 45. Our product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, including opening additional Anthropologie stores in Europe. Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 36.1% and 0.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. We operated 34 Free People stores as of January 31, 2010, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2010 we opened 4 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2010, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is our newest store concept designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment through its large and freestanding site, inspired by the greenhouse. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. Terrain store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 45 new stores during fiscal 2011, including approximately 9 new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Direct to Consumer Anthropologie offers a direct to consumer catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2010, we circulated approximately 17.4 million catalogs and believe that our catalogs have been instrumental in helping to build the Anthropologie brand identity with our target customers. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 18.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. Anthropologie operates a web site, www.anthropologie.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Anthropologies reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of Anthropologies store operations. Urban Outfitters offers a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2010, we circulated approximately 12.1 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 13.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. 24 Table of Contents Urban Outfitters operates a web site, www.urbanoutfitters.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores. As with the Urban Outfitters catalog, we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers, as well as helps to support the strength of Urban Outfitters store operations. Urban Outfitters also operates a web site targeting our European customers. The web site, www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk, captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution center located in the United Kingdom. We believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with our European customers as well as helps to support our Urban Outfitters European store operations. Free People offers a direct to consumer catalog offering select merchandise most of which is also available in our Free People stores. During fiscal 2010, Free People circulated approximately 7.4 million catalogs. We believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness. We plan to expand catalog circulation to approximately 8.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2011. Free People operates a web site, www.freepeople.com, that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site exposes consumers to the product assortment found at Free People retail stores as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. As with our catalog, we believe that the web site increases Free Peoples reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Free Peoples store operations. Terrain operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site, www.shopterrain.com, was launched in September 2009. The web site exposes consumers to a portion of the product assortment found at the Terrain retail store. We believe that the web site increases Terrains reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the traffic of Terrains store operations. Increases in our catalog circulation are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our direct to consumer customers to determine which customers who respond to our catalog mailings. We also utilize the services of list rental companies to identify potential customers that will receive future catalogs. We plan on increasing our spending on investments in web marketing for Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People in fiscal 2011. These increases will be based on our ongoing daily evaluation of the customers response rate to our marketing investments. Direct to consumer sales for all brands combined were approximately 16.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. Wholesale Operations The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. During fiscal 2010, Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including 25 Table of Contents Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, Urban Outfitters and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 4.9% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. The Leifsdottir wholesale division was established in fiscal 2009. Leifsdottir designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel including dresses, tops and bottoms. Leifsdottir is sold through luxury department stores including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, select specialty stores and our own Anthropologie stores. Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer at which time we record the redemption of the 26 Table of Contents card for merchandise as a sale or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2010 and 2009, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $9.9 million and $7.5 million, representing 2.9% and 2.7% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent debt securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses, as defined by ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities, are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as long term have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as long term assets. Successful auctions would be classified as current assets. Marketable securities as of January 31, 2010 and 2009 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable 27 Table of Contents values, if required. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $186.1 million and $169.7 million, representing 11.4% and 12.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2010 were performed as of June 2009 and January 2010. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $540.0 million and $505.4 million, respectively, representing 33.0% and 38.0% of total assets, respectively. In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. In January of fiscal 2010 we converted one Free People store location in Chicago to a Free People Wholesale Showroom. As of the date of this report, all of our stores are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. 28 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 totaled $43.6 million and $46.3 million, respectively, representing 2.7% and 3.5% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.2 million as of January 31, 2010 from $1.4 million as of January 31, 2009. This increase is based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain state and foreign jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 59.4 61.1 61.7 Gross profit 40.6 38.9 38.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.1 22.6 23.3 Income from operations 17.5 16.3 15.0 Interest income 0.3 0.6 0.6 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 17.8 16.9 15.6 Income tax expense 6.4 6.0 4.9 Net income 11.4 % 10.9 % 10.7 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 5.6 % 21.7 % 23.1 % Gross profit 10.2 % 23.7 % 27.6 % Income from operations 13.2 % 33.1 % 37.2 % Net income 10.3 % 24.4 % 37.9 % Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 5.6% to $1.94 billion, from $1.83 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $103 million increase was attributable to a $109 million or 6.3% increase, in retail segment net sales that was partially offset by a $6 million or 5.4% decline in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2010 was driven by an increase of $115 million in non comparable and new store net sales, and an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $53 million or 19.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $35 million or 2.6% in comparable store net sales and $24 million of foreign currency translation adjustments. The decrease in comparable store net sales was comprised of 0.6%, 11.0% and 4.0% decreases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The decline in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $11 million or 10.6% decline at Free People wholesale that was partially offset by an increase of $5 million or 185% at Leifsdottir. 30 Table of Contents The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 and 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2010. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of decreases in the number of units sold per transaction, that were partially offset by slight increases in average unit sales prices and transactions. Thus far during fiscal 2011 total Company net sales are favorable versus the same period in the prior year and our comparable retail segment sales trend has improved significantly from our most recently completed quarter. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Catalog circulation across all brands decreased by 3 million or 8.2%. The decrease in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by decreases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottir wholesale net sales increase was a result of increased transactions that more than offset a decline in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2010 increased to 40.6% of net sales or $786 million from 38.9% of net sales or $713 million in fiscal 2009. This improvement is primarily due to improvements in our initial merchandise margins which were partially offset by a higher rate of store occupancy expense driven by the decrease in comparable store sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2010 increased by $16 million or 9.7% to $186 million from $170 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non comparable stores. Comparable store inventory at cost decreased by 3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 increased to 23.1% of net sales or $447 million versus 22.6% of net sales or $414 million for fiscal 2009. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in incentive based compensation that relates to meeting targeted operating performance goals in fiscal 2010. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 17.5% of net sales or $339 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 36.2% of income for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010s tax rate is primarily due to a lower proportion of tax free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior years holdings. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2011 to be favorable to fiscal 2010 due in part to an anticipated increase in income generated from foreign operations. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net sales in fiscal 2009 increased by 21.7% to $1.83 billion, from $1.51 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $327 million increase was primarily attributable to a $311 million or 22.0% increase, in retail segment sales. Our wholesale segment contributed $16 million to this increase for fiscal year 2009 as Free People wholesale net sales increased $13 million or 13.4%, excluding sales to our retail segment, and Leifsdottir contributed $3 million. The growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal 2009 was driven by an increase of $156 million in non comparable and new store net sales, an increase 31 Table of Contents in direct to consumer net sales of $67 million or 32.4%, an increase to comparable store net sales of $88 million or 7.8%. The increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of 3.4%, 4.1% and 11.9% increases at Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 and 38 new stores in fiscal 2008 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2009. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of increases in average unit sales prices and increases in transactions resulting from an increased response to our merchandise offerings. These increases more than offset a slight decrease in the number of units sold per transaction. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2009 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, that more than offset minor decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Circulation modestly increased by 688,000 catalogs or 1.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increased average unit sale prices and increased transactions. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2009 increased to 38.9% of net sales or $713 million from 38.3% of net sales or $577 million in fiscal 2008. This improvement is primarily due to leveraging of our store occupancy expenses and improvements in our initial merchandise margins which are partially offset by adjustments to record anticipated markdowns during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Total inventories at January 31, 2009 decreased by 1.3% to $170 million from $172 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to a 13% decrease in comparable store inventory which more than offset additions to inventories for new and non comparable stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 decreased to 22.6% of net sales versus 23.3% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The rate reduction is primarily due to controlling selling and store support related expenses in addition to lower corporate expenses resulting from non recurring legal fees incurred in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 increased to $414 million from $352 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 15.0% of net sales or $225 million for fiscal 2008. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.6% of income for fiscal 2008. The increase in this years tax rate is due to the prior years annual effective tax rate being favorably impacted by the receipt of one time federal tax incentives for work performed on the development of our new home offices. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $745 million as of January 31, 2010 as compared to $521 million as of January 31, 2009 and $374 million as of January 31, 2008. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2010 was primarily a result of $325 million from cash provided by operating activities as compared to $252 million in fiscal 2009, that primarily consists of net income and the add back of the non cash items, depreciation and 32 Table of Contents amortization expense. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2010 was $495 million of which $109 million was used primarily for the construction of new stores and $386 million was the net activity used for purchases and sales of marketable securities. Cash from financing activities in fiscal 2010 of $10 million was related to exercises of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $618 million, $483 million and $266 million, respectively. The changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses and in our European subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $109 million, $109 million and $92 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2011, we plan to construct and open approximately 45 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, complete an expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, modestly increase our catalog circulation by approximately 3 million catalogs to approximately 40 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 to approximately $130 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. During fiscal 2011, we plan to complete a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We anticipate the project will cost approximately $25 million. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. During fiscal 2010, we completed a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our midwest and east coast stores. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. During fiscal 2008, we entered into an operating lease for a warehouse facility in Reno, Nevada to support our western United States stores. The facility is approximately 214,500 square feet and the term of the lease is set to expire in 2017 with our option to renew for up to an additional 10 years. During fiscal 2008, we invested approximately $6.3 million in equipment and other improvements for this location. In March 2009, we executed a lease for an additional 39,000 square feet of warehouse space at our Reno, Nevada facility that is included in the total noted above. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the next several years. During fiscal 2011, we may enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. We do not anticipate that these acquisitions or transactions individually or in the aggregate will be material to our financial statements as a whole. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes us to repurchase up to 8,000,000 common shares from time to time, based upon prevailing market conditions. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we repurchased and subsequently retired 1,220,000 shares at a cost of approximately $21 million. No shares have been repurchased since fiscal 2007. 33 Table of Contents On September 21, 2009, we amended our renewed and amended line of credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association (the Line). This amendment adds additional subsidiary borrowers and adds certain additional subsidiary guarantors. The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion, subject to a seven day request period. As of January 31, 2010, the credit limit under the Line was $60.0 million. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of January 31, 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. As of January 31, 2010, there were no borrowings under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $36.3 million as of January 31, 2010. The available credit, including the accordion feature under the Line was $63.7 million as of January 31, 2010. We believe the renewed Line will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal 2011. We plan to renew the line during fiscal 2011 and expect the renewal will satisfy our credit needs through fiscal 2011 and the foreseeable future. Wachovia Bank, National Association was acquired by Wells Fargo, effective January 1, 2009. The Wells Fargo acquisition did not affect the original line agreement. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2010: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,155,843 $ 139,562 $ 421,370 $ 242,101 $ 352,810 Purchase orders (2) 221,985 221,985 Construction contracts (3) 2,893 2,893 Tax Contingencies (4) 710 710 Total contractual obligations $ 1,381,431 $ 365,150 $ 421,370 $ 242,101 $ 352,810 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 22 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 22 locations was approximately $3.3 million for fiscal 2010. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 22 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2010. 34 Table of Contents (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $0.7 million that are classified as a current liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2010. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10.0 million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. The $10.0 is classified as a long term liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2010. Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 32,349 $ 32,349 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 3,932 3,932 Total commercial commitments $ 36,281 $ 36,281 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three years ended January 31, 2010, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) which was codified into The Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810. This standard responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the involvement with variable interest entities. Specifically, ASC Topic 810 requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In addition, the standard requires additional disclosures about the involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. The provisions of ASC Topic 810 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. We plan to adopt these provisions in fiscal 2011 and anticipate the adoption to have no effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended April 30,2009 July 31,2009 Oct. 31,2009 Jan. 31,2010 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 384,796 $ 458,626 $ 505,900 $ 588,493 Gross profit 143,305 187,091 210,088 245,661 Net income 30,805 49,021 62,392 77,675 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.29 0.37 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.18 0.29 0.36 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 24 % 26 % 30 % Net income 14 % 22 % 29 % 35 % Fiscal 2009 Quarter Ended April 30,2008 July 31,2008 Oct. 31,2008 Jan. 31,2009 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 394,292 $ 454,295 $ 477,953 $ 508,078 Gross profit 158,680 186,510 195,396 172,892 Net income 42,557 56,988 59,274 40,545 Net income per common share basic 0.26 0.34 0.35 0.24 Net income per common share diluted 0.25 0.33 0.35 0.24 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 25 % 26 % 28 % Net income 21 % 29 % 30 % 20 % Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2010 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, 36 Table of Contents Federal Government Agencies, FDIC insured corporate bonds, pre refunded tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, and auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 4.5% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated ARS that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had a par value of $37.6 million and a fair value of $33.5 million as of January 31, 2010. As of January 31, 2010, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2009, the Company had $44.0 million of par and 38.7 million of fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $4.1 million and $5.3 million of temporary impairment charges on our ARS as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe it is not likely to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as long term assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments.
