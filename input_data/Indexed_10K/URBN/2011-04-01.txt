Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources, were necessary to adequately support our growth. We believe we may need to further expand the square footage of our home office and distribution facilities to support our growth over the next several years. For more information on our distribution center properties, see Item 1: Business Company Operations Distribution. We believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition. 18 Table of Contents All of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain stores are leased, well maintained and in good operating condition. Our retail stores are typically leased for a term of ten years with renewal options for an additional five to ten years. Total estimated selling square feet for stores open, under lease as of January 31, 2011, by Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People and Terrain was approximately 1,621,000, 1,124,000, 58,000 and 20,000, respectively. Terrain also utilizes two acres of outdoor space to sell seasonal, live plants, accessories and outdoor furniture. The average store selling square feet is approximately 9,200 for Urban Outfitters, 7,300 for Anthropologie and 1,400 for Free People. Selling square feet can sometimes change due to floor moves, use of staircases, cash register configuration and other factors.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain, Leifsdottir and BHLDN brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and our Leifsdottir wholesale division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir wholesale designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. Our comparable retail segment net sales data includes our comparable store and comparable direct to consumer channels. A store is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct to consumer channel is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. Sales from stores and direct to consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store or channel are considered non comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2011 ended on January 31, 2011. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Store As of January 31, 2011, we operated 176 Urban Outfitters stores of which 144 are located in the United States, 10 are located in Canada and 22 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2011, we opened 21 new Urban Outfitters stores, 14 of which are located within the United States, 3 of which are located in Canada and 4 of which are located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Outfitters North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 31.8% and 5.3% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2011. 25 Table of Contents We operated 153 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2011, of which 147 are located in the United States, 4 are located in Canada and 2 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2011 we opened 16 new Anthropologie stores, of which 14 are located within the United States, 1 is located in Canada, and 1 is located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 35.1% and 0.8% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2011. We operated 42 Free People stores as of January 31, 2011, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2011 we opened nine new Free People stores and converted one store location to a Free People wholesale showroom. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2011, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. We are evaluating locations for future Terrain garden centers. Terrain store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 50 to 55 new stores during fiscal 2012, including one BHLDN store and approximately 14 new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Direct to Consumer Anthropologie offers a direct to consumer catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2011, we circulated approximately 17.6 million catalogs. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 23.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2012. Our Anthropologie European customers are offered a direct to consumer catalog that markets selected merchandise, most of which is also offered at our Anthropologie stores located in Europe. The catalog was launched in September 2010 and we circulated approximately 126,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2011. We plan to circulate approximately 595,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2012. We anticipate the number of catalogs circulated to grow consistent with the anticipated demand from our European Anthropologie customers. Anthropologie operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar yet broader array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. 26 Table of Contents Anthropologie also operates a web site that targets our European customers. The web site was launched in March 2010. The web site captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution center located in the United Kingdom. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we anticipate opening our own distribution center in Rushden, England. Urban Outfitters offers a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2011, we circulated approximately 14.2 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 15.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2012. Our Urban Outfitters European customers are offered a direct to consumer catalog that markets selected merchandise, most of which is also offered at our Urban Outfitters stores located in Europe. The catalog was launched in November 2010 and we circulated approximately 200,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2011. We plan to circulate approximately 800,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2012. We anticipate the number of catalogs circulated to grow consistent with the anticipated demand from our European Urban Outfitters customers. Urban Outfitters operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in the stores. Urban Outfitters also operates three web sites targeting our European customers.

The web site was launched in September 2009. The web site exposes consumers to all product offerings from the Leifsdottir concept. BHLDN launched its website on February 14, 2011. The website accepts orders directly from customers and exposes consumers to all product offerings from the BHLDN concept. A retail store is planned to open during fiscal 2012. 27 Table of Contents Increases in our catalog circulation are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our direct to consumer customers to determine which customers respond to our catalog mailings. We also utilize the services of list rental companies to identify potential customers that will receive future catalogs. We believe that our web sites increase the reputation and recognition of our brands with our target customers and help support the strength of our stores operations. We plan on increasing our spending on investments in web marketing during fiscal 2012 for all of our brands. These increases will be based on our daily evaluation of the customers response rate to our marketing investments. Direct to consumer sales for all brands combined were approximately 19.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. Wholesale Operations The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. During fiscal 2011, Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, and our own Free People stores.

Leifsdottir is sold through luxury department stores including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, select specialty stores and our own Anthropologie stores. Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. 28 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer channel is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $11.4 million and $9.9 million, representing 3.0% and 2.9% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that are held at amortized cost and that we have both the intent and the belief that it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security prior to its maturity and recovery of full amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of 29 Table of Contents less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non current have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as non current assets. Successful auctions would be classified as current assets. All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2011 and 2010 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $229.6 million and $186.1 million, representing 12.8% and 11.4% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2011 were performed as of June 2010 and January 2011. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $586.3 million and $540.0 million, respectively, representing 32.7% and 33.0% of total assets, respectively. 30 Table of Contents In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. As of the date of this report, all of our stores are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $52.1 million and $43.6 million, respectively, representing 2.9% and 2.7% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.6 million as of January 31, 2011 from $2.2 million as of January 31, 2010. This increase is based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgement to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgements and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 31 Table of Contents Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 58.8 59.4 61.1 Gross profit 41.2 40.6 38.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.0 23.1 22.6 Income from operations 18.2 17.5 16.3 Interest income 0.1 0.3 0.6 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 18.3 17.8 16.9 Income tax expense 6.3 6.4 6.0 Net income 12.0 % 11.4 % 10.9 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 17.4 % 5.6 % 21.7 % Gross profit 19.1 % 10.2 % 23.7 % Income from operations 22.2 % 13.2 % 33.1 % Net income 24.1 % 10.3 % 24.4 % 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased by 17.4% to $2.27 billion, from $1.94 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $336 million increase was attributable to a $320 million or 17.5% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $16 million or 15.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2011 was driven by increases of $161 million in non comparable and new store net sales, $110 million, or 34.0%, in direct to consumer net sales and $49 million, or 4%, in comparable store net sales. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 9.8%, 6.9% and 26.7% increases at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People respectively. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $15 million, or a 15.9% increase, at Free People wholesale and a $1.0 million, or an 11.9% increase, at Leifsdottir wholesale. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2011. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions and units sold per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit sales prices. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2011 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 2.8 million, or 7.7%. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, comparable retail segment net sales are low single digit negative. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottirs wholesale net sales increase was a result of an increase in the number of transactions that more than offset a decrease in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2011 increased to 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, from 40.6% of net sales, or $786 million, in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leveraging of store occupancy expense driven by positive comparable store sales. Total Company inventory increased 23.3% to $230 million from $186 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores and our direct to consumer channel growth. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 9.7%, while comparable store inventories increased 4.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011, decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 23.1% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in percentage was primarily due to leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable costs driven by the positive retail segment comparable sales. In fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75 million, to $522 million, from $447 million in the prior fiscal year. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011 compared to 17.5% of net sales, or $339 million, for fiscal 2010. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2011 decreased to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.2% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2010. This decrease was due to the favorable mix of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions and the federal rehabilitation credit included in fiscal 2011. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to 33 Table of Contents our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be higher than that of fiscal 2011 due in part to the expiration of the federal rehabilitation credit received in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 5.6%, to $1.94 billion from $1.83 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $103 million increase was attributable to a $109 million or 6.3% increase, in retail segment net sales that was partially offset by a $6 million or 5.4% decline in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2010 was driven by an increase of $115 million in non comparable and new store net sales, and an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $53 million or 19.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $35 million or 2.6% in comparable store net sales and $24 million of foreign currency translation adjustments. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 3.3% and 7.1% increases at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively, partially offset by a 1.0% decrease at Urban Outfitters. The decline in our wholesale segment net sales was due to an $11 million or 10.6% decline at Free People wholesale that was partially offset by an increase of $5 million or 185% at Leifsdottir. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 and 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2010. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of decreases in the number of units sold per transaction, that were partially offset by slight increases in average unit sales prices and transactions. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Catalog circulation across all brands decreased by 3 million or 8.2%. The decrease in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by decreases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottir wholesale net sales increase was a result of increased transactions that more than offset a decline in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2010 increased to 40.6% of net sales or $786 million from 38.9% of net sales or $713 million in fiscal 2009. This improvement is primarily due to improvements in our initial merchandise margins which were partially offset by a higher rate of store occupancy expense driven by the decrease in comparable store sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2010 increased by $16 million or 9.7% to $186 million from $170 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non comparable stores. Comparable store inventory at cost decreased by 3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 increased to 23.1% of net sales or $447 million versus 22.6% of net sales or $414 million for fiscal 2009. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in incentive based compensation that relates to meeting targeted operating performance goals in fiscal 2010. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 17.5% of net sales or $339 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 36.2% of income for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010s tax rate is primarily due to a lower 34 Table of Contents proportion of tax free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior years holdings. See Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $809 million as of January 31, 2011 as compared to $745 million as of January 31, 2010 and $521 million as of January 31, 2009. The $64 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of $385 million from cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $205 million of cash used for share repurchases and $144 million of cash used for property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2011 was $36 million, consisting of $144 million used primarily for the construction of new stores partially offset by $108 million in net proceeds from marketable securities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 of $168 million was primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program partially offset by cash provided by the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $593 million, $618 million and $483 million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also used our cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. We continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses, distribution facilities, home office and our international subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances, included in deferred rent, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $144 million, $109 million, and $113 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2012, we plan to construct and open approximately 50 to 55 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, construct additional distribution and fulfillment facilities in Rushden, England and Reno, Nevada, continue to expand our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, upgrade our systems, increase our catalog circulation by approximately 9 million catalogs to approximately 49 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 to approximately $188 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office, fulfillment and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. During fiscal 2011, we completed a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at a cost of approximately $25 million. During fiscal 2010, we completed a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our Midwest and East coast stores. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the Company to purchase up to 8.0 million common shares. We repurchased 1.2 million common shares during fiscal year 2007. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased and subsequently retired 35 Table of Contents 6.4 million common shares for $205.0 million. On November 16, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million additional common shares. This authorization supplements the Companys 2006 stock repurchase program. Subsequent to January 31, 2011 and through April 1, 2011, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million common shares for approximately $148.7 million. This activity completes our 2006 repurchase program and leaves approximately 5.6 million shares available for repurchase under the 2010 program. On September 21, 2009, we amended our renewed and amended line of credit facility (the Line) with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the Bank). This amendment added an additional borrower and certain additional guarantors. The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion. On May 27, 2010, we executed a fifth amendment to the Line increasing its credit limit to $80.0 million. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of and during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $55.5 million as of January 31, 2011. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line totaled approximately $44.5 million as of January 31, 2011. We are negotiating a renewal of the Line with the Bank. As part of these negotiations, we were granted an extension of all of the existing terms, covenants and conditions of the Line through April, 2011. We expect the renewal to satisfy our letter of credit needs through at least 2014. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2011: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,280,955 $ 164,289 $ 480,931 $ 253,011 $ 382,724 Purchase orders (2) 278,079 278,079 Construction contracts (3) 18,004 18,004 Tax Contingencies (4) 798 798 Total contractual obligations $ 1,577,836 $ 461,170 $ 480,931 $ 253,011 $ 382,724 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease 36 Table of Contents payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 26 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 26 locations was approximately $4,705 for fiscal 2011. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 20 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2011. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $798 that are classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2011. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10,580 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $10,580 liability was classified as a non current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2011. Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 51,397 $ 51,397 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 4,081 4,081 Total commercial commitments $ 55,478 $ 55,478 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update which amends fair value measurements and disclosures and aims to improve the transparency of financial reporting of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The update requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and the basis for such transfers. Also required are disclosures for activity in Level 3 including purchase, sale, issuance and settlement 37 Table of Contents information. Lastly, it clarifies guidance regarding disaggregation and disclosure of information about valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements in Level 2 and Level 3 categories. We have adopted the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures as of February 1, 2010 which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. This adoption had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have not adopted the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements as these disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect this adoption to have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 38 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2011 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 Oct. 31,2010 Jan. 31,2011 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 479,961 $ 552,159 $ 573,592 $ 668,390 Gross profit 200,786 234,781 235,993 265,060 Net income 52,957 71,657 73,106 75,238 Net income per common share basic 0.31 0.42 0.44 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.31 0.42 0.43 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 24 % 25 % 30 % Net income 19 % 26 % 27 % 28 % Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2009 July 31,2009 Oct. 31,2009 Jan. 31,2010 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 384,796 $ 458,626 $ 505,900 $ 588,493 Gross profit 143,305 187,091 210,088 245,661 Net income 30,805 49,021 62,392 77,675 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.29 0.37 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.18 0.29 0.36 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 24 % 26 % 30 % Net income 14 % 22 % 29 % 35 % (1) The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year to date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. 39 Table of Contents The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2011 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, corporate bonds rated A or better, federal government agencies, pre refunded tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, treasury bills, auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate and FDIC insured corporate bonds. We believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. This is due to the conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio and the fact that all securities, with the exception of ARS, mature in three years or less. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 3.6% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated ARS that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had an amortized cost of $33.3 million and a fair value of $29.5 million, as of January 31, 2011. As of January 31, 2011, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2010, the Company had $37.6 million of amortized cost and $33.5 million of fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $3.8 million and $4.1 million of temporary impairment charges on our ARS as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe it is not likely to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as non current assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments. 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the related notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this report. The results of operations for past accounting periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future accounting period. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands, except share amounts and per share data) Income Statement Data: Net sales $ 2,274,102 $ 1,937,815 $ 1,834,618 $ 1,507,724 $ 1,224,717 Gross profit 936,620 786,145 713,478 576,772 451,921 Income from operations 414,203 338,984 299,435 224,945 163,989 Net income 272,958 219,893 199,364 160,231 116,206 Net income per common share basic $ 1.64 $ 1.31 $ 1.20 $ 0.97 $ 0.71 Weighted average common shares outstanding basic 166,896,322 168,053,502 166,793,062 165,305,207 164,679,786 Net income per common share diluted $ 1.60 $ 1.28 $ 1.17 $ 0.94 $ 0.69 Weighted average common shares outstanding diluted 170,333,550 171,230,245 170,860,605 169,640,585 168,652,005 Balance Sheet Data: Working capital $ 592,953 $ 617,664 $ 483,252 $ 266,232 $ 231,087 Total assets 1,794,321 1,636,093 1,329,009 1,142,791 899,251 Total liabilities 382,773 339,318 275,234 289,360 223,968 Total shareholders equity $ 1,411,548 $ 1,296,775 $ 1,053,775 $ 853,431 $ 675,283 24 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain, Leifsdottir and BHLDN brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and our Leifsdottir wholesale division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir wholesale designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. Our comparable retail segment net sales data includes our comparable store and comparable direct to consumer channels. A store is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct to consumer channel is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. Sales from stores and direct to consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store or channel are considered non comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2011 ended on January 31, 2011. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Store As of January 31, 2011, we operated 176 Urban Outfitters stores of which 144 are located in the United States, 10 are located in Canada and 22 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2011, we opened 21 new Urban Outfitters stores, 14 of which are located within the United States, 3 of which are located in Canada and 4 of which are located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Outfitters North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 31.8% and 5.3% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2011. 25 Table of Contents We operated 153 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2011, of which 147 are located in the United States, 4 are located in Canada and 2 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2011 we opened 16 new Anthropologie stores, of which 14 are located within the United States, 1 is located in Canada, and 1 is located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States.

We operated 42 Free People stores as of January 31, 2011, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2011 we opened nine new Free People stores and converted one store location to a Free People wholesale showroom. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2011, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. We are evaluating locations for future Terrain garden centers.

Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our direct to consumer customers to determine which customers respond to our catalog mailings. We also utilize the services of list rental companies to identify potential customers that will receive future catalogs. We believe that our web sites increase the reputation and recognition of our brands with our target customers and help support the strength of our stores operations. We plan on increasing our spending on investments in web marketing during fiscal 2012 for all of our brands. These increases will be based on our daily evaluation of the customers response rate to our marketing investments. Direct to consumer sales for all brands combined were approximately 19.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. Wholesale Operations The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. During fiscal 2011, Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, and our own Free People stores.

Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. 28 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer channel is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $11.4 million and $9.9 million, representing 3.0% and 2.9% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that are held at amortized cost and that we have both the intent and the belief that it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security prior to its maturity and recovery of full amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of 29 Table of Contents less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non current have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as non current assets. Successful auctions would be classified as current assets. All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2011 and 2010 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $229.6 million and $186.1 million, representing 12.8% and 11.4% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2011 were performed as of June 2010 and January 2011. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $586.3 million and $540.0 million, respectively, representing 32.7% and 33.0% of total assets, respectively. 30 Table of Contents In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. As of the date of this report, all of our stores are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $52.1 million and $43.6 million, respectively, representing 2.9% and 2.7% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.6 million as of January 31, 2011 from $2.2 million as of January 31, 2010. This increase is based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgement to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgements and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 31 Table of Contents Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 58.8 59.4 61.1 Gross profit 41.2 40.6 38.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.0 23.1 22.6 Income from operations 18.2 17.5 16.3 Interest income 0.1 0.3 0.6 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 18.3 17.8 16.9 Income tax expense 6.3 6.4 6.0 Net income 12.0 % 11.4 % 10.9 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 17.4 % 5.6 % 21.7 % Gross profit 19.1 % 10.2 % 23.7 % Income from operations 22.2 % 13.2 % 33.1 % Net income 24.1 % 10.3 % 24.4 % 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased by 17.4% to $2.27 billion, from $1.94 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $336 million increase was attributable to a $320 million or 17.5% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $16 million or 15.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2011 was driven by increases of $161 million in non comparable and new store net sales, $110 million, or 34.0%, in direct to consumer net sales and $49 million, or 4%, in comparable store net sales. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 9.8%, 6.9% and 26.7% increases at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People respectively. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $15 million, or a 15.9% increase, at Free People wholesale and a $1.0 million, or an 11.9% increase, at Leifsdottir wholesale. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2011. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions and units sold per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit sales prices. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2011 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 2.8 million, or 7.7%. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, comparable retail segment net sales are low single digit negative. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottirs wholesale net sales increase was a result of an increase in the number of transactions that more than offset a decrease in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2011 increased to 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, from 40.6% of net sales, or $786 million, in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leveraging of store occupancy expense driven by positive comparable store sales. Total Company inventory increased 23.3% to $230 million from $186 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores and our direct to consumer channel growth. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 9.7%, while comparable store inventories increased 4.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011, decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 23.1% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in percentage was primarily due to leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable costs driven by the positive retail segment comparable sales. In fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75 million, to $522 million, from $447 million in the prior fiscal year. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011 compared to 17.5% of net sales, or $339 million, for fiscal 2010. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2011 decreased to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.2% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2010. This decrease was due to the favorable mix of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions and the federal rehabilitation credit included in fiscal 2011. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to 33 Table of Contents our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be higher than that of fiscal 2011 due in part to the expiration of the federal rehabilitation credit received in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 5.6%, to $1.94 billion from $1.83 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $103 million increase was attributable to a $109 million or 6.3% increase, in retail segment net sales that was partially offset by a $6 million or 5.4% decline in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2010 was driven by an increase of $115 million in non comparable and new store net sales, and an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $53 million or 19.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $35 million or 2.6% in comparable store net sales and $24 million of foreign currency translation adjustments. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 3.3% and 7.1% increases at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively, partially offset by a 1.0% decrease at Urban Outfitters. The decline in our wholesale segment net sales was due to an $11 million or 10.6% decline at Free People wholesale that was partially offset by an increase of $5 million or 185% at Leifsdottir. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 and 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2010. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of decreases in the number of units sold per transaction, that were partially offset by slight increases in average unit sales prices and transactions. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Catalog circulation across all brands decreased by 3 million or 8.2%. The decrease in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by decreases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottir wholesale net sales increase was a result of increased transactions that more than offset a decline in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2010 increased to 40.6% of net sales or $786 million from 38.9% of net sales or $713 million in fiscal 2009. This improvement is primarily due to improvements in our initial merchandise margins which were partially offset by a higher rate of store occupancy expense driven by the decrease in comparable store sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2010 increased by $16 million or 9.7% to $186 million from $170 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non comparable stores. Comparable store inventory at cost decreased by 3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 increased to 23.1% of net sales or $447 million versus 22.6% of net sales or $414 million for fiscal 2009. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in incentive based compensation that relates to meeting targeted operating performance goals in fiscal 2010. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 17.5% of net sales or $339 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 36.2% of income for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010s tax rate is primarily due to a lower 34 Table of Contents proportion of tax free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior years holdings. See Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $809 million as of January 31, 2011 as compared to $745 million as of January 31, 2010 and $521 million as of January 31, 2009. The $64 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of $385 million from cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $205 million of cash used for share repurchases and $144 million of cash used for property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2011 was $36 million, consisting of $144 million used primarily for the construction of new stores partially offset by $108 million in net proceeds from marketable securities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 of $168 million was primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program partially offset by cash provided by the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $593 million, $618 million and $483 million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also used our cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. We continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses, distribution facilities, home office and our international subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances, included in deferred rent, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $144 million, $109 million, and $113 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2012, we plan to construct and open approximately 50 to 55 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, construct additional distribution and fulfillment facilities in Rushden, England and Reno, Nevada, continue to expand our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, upgrade our systems, increase our catalog circulation by approximately 9 million catalogs to approximately 49 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 to approximately $188 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office, fulfillment and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. During fiscal 2011, we completed a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at a cost of approximately $25 million. During fiscal 2010, we completed a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our Midwest and East coast stores. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the Company to purchase up to 8.0 million common shares. We repurchased 1.2 million common shares during fiscal year 2007. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased and subsequently retired 35 Table of Contents 6.4 million common shares for $205.0 million. On November 16, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million additional common shares. This authorization supplements the Companys 2006 stock repurchase program. Subsequent to January 31, 2011 and through April 1, 2011, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million common shares for approximately $148.7 million. This activity completes our 2006 repurchase program and leaves approximately 5.6 million shares available for repurchase under the 2010 program. On September 21, 2009, we amended our renewed and amended line of credit facility (the Line) with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the Bank). This amendment added an additional borrower and certain additional guarantors. The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion. On May 27, 2010, we executed a fifth amendment to the Line increasing its credit limit to $80.0 million. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of and during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $55.5 million as of January 31, 2011. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line totaled approximately $44.5 million as of January 31, 2011. We are negotiating a renewal of the Line with the Bank. As part of these negotiations, we were granted an extension of all of the existing terms, covenants and conditions of the Line through April, 2011. We expect the renewal to satisfy our letter of credit needs through at least 2014. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2011: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,280,955 $ 164,289 $ 480,931 $ 253,011 $ 382,724 Purchase orders (2) 278,079 278,079 Construction contracts (3) 18,004 18,004 Tax Contingencies (4) 798 798 Total contractual obligations $ 1,577,836 $ 461,170 $ 480,931 $ 253,011 $ 382,724 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease 36 Table of Contents payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 26 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 26 locations was approximately $4,705 for fiscal 2011. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 20 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2011. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $798 that are classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2011. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10,580 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $10,580 liability was classified as a non current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2011. Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 51,397 $ 51,397 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 4,081 4,081 Total commercial commitments $ 55,478 $ 55,478 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update which amends fair value measurements and disclosures and aims to improve the transparency of financial reporting of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The update requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and the basis for such transfers. Also required are disclosures for activity in Level 3 including purchase, sale, issuance and settlement 37 Table of Contents information. Lastly, it clarifies guidance regarding disaggregation and disclosure of information about valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements in Level 2 and Level 3 categories. We have adopted the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures as of February 1, 2010 which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. This adoption had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have not adopted the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements as these disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect this adoption to have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 38 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2011 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 Oct. 31,2010 Jan. 31,2011 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 479,961 $ 552,159 $ 573,592 $ 668,390 Gross profit 200,786 234,781 235,993 265,060 Net income 52,957 71,657 73,106 75,238 Net income per common share basic 0.31 0.42 0.44 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.31 0.42 0.43 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 24 % 25 % 30 % Net income 19 % 26 % 27 % 28 % Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2009 July 31,2009 Oct. 31,2009 Jan. 31,2010 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 384,796 $ 458,626 $ 505,900 $ 588,493 Gross profit 143,305 187,091 210,088 245,661 Net income 30,805 49,021 62,392 77,675 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.29 0.37 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.18 0.29 0.36 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 24 % 26 % 30 % Net income 14 % 22 % 29 % 35 % (1) The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year to date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. 39 Table of Contents The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2011 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, corporate bonds rated A or better, federal government agencies, pre refunded tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, treasury bills, auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate and FDIC insured corporate bonds. We believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. This is due to the conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio and the fact that all securities, with the exception of ARS, mature in three years or less. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 3.6% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated ARS that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had an amortized cost of $33.3 million and a fair value of $29.5 million, as of January 31, 2011. As of January 31, 2011, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2010, the Company had $37.6 million of amortized cost and $33.5 million of fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $3.8 million and $4.1 million of temporary impairment charges on our ARS as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe it is not likely to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as non current assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain, Leifsdottir and BHLDN brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, catalogs, call centers and web sites. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division and our Leifsdottir wholesale division. Free People wholesale designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Leifsdottir wholesale designs, develops and markets sophisticated womens contemporary apparel. Our comparable retail segment net sales data includes our comparable store and comparable direct to consumer channels. A store is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct to consumer channel is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. Sales from stores and direct to consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store or channel are considered non comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2011 ended on January 31, 2011. Our historical and long term goal is to achieve a net sales compounded annual growth rate of 20% or better through a combination of opening new stores, growing comparable store sales, continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations and introducing new concepts. Retail Store As of January 31, 2011, we operated 176 Urban Outfitters stores of which 144 are located in the United States, 10 are located in Canada and 22 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2011, we opened 21 new Urban Outfitters stores, 14 of which are located within the United States, 3 of which are located in Canada and 4 of which are located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Outfitters North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 31.8% and 5.3% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2011. 25 Table of Contents We operated 153 Anthropologie stores as of January 31, 2011, of which 147 are located in the United States, 4 are located in Canada and 2 are located in Europe. During fiscal 2011 we opened 16 new Anthropologie stores, of which 14 are located within the United States, 1 is located in Canada, and 1 is located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 35.1% and 0.8% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2011. We operated 42 Free People stores as of January 31, 2011, all of which are located in the United States. During fiscal 2011 we opened nine new Free People stores and converted one store location to a Free People wholesale showroom. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. We operated one Terrain garden center as of January 31, 2011, which is located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. We are evaluating locations for future Terrain garden centers. Terrain store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 50 to 55 new stores during fiscal 2012, including one BHLDN store and approximately 14 new Free People stores. The remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Direct to Consumer Anthropologie offers a direct to consumer catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. During fiscal 2011, we circulated approximately 17.6 million catalogs. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 23.2 million catalogs during fiscal 2012. Our Anthropologie European customers are offered a direct to consumer catalog that markets selected merchandise, most of which is also offered at our Anthropologie stores located in Europe. The catalog was launched in September 2010 and we circulated approximately 126,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2011. We plan to circulate approximately 595,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2012. We anticipate the number of catalogs circulated to grow consistent with the anticipated demand from our European Anthropologie customers. Anthropologie operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar yet broader array of apparel, accessories, household and gift merchandise as found in the stores. 26 Table of Contents Anthropologie also operates a web site that targets our European customers. The web site was launched in March 2010. The web site captures the spirit of our European stores by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Fulfillment is provided from a third party distribution center located in the United Kingdom. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we anticipate opening our own distribution center in Rushden, England. Urban Outfitters offers a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise, much of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. During fiscal 2011, we circulated approximately 14.2 million Urban Outfitters catalogs. We plan to increase circulation to approximately 15.4 million catalogs during fiscal 2012. Our Urban Outfitters European customers are offered a direct to consumer catalog that markets selected merchandise, most of which is also offered at our Urban Outfitters stores located in Europe. The catalog was launched in November 2010 and we circulated approximately 200,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2011. We plan to circulate approximately 800,000 catalogs in Europe during fiscal 2012. We anticipate the number of catalogs circulated to grow consistent with the anticipated demand from our European Urban Outfitters customers. Urban Outfitters operates a web site that accepts orders directly from customers. The web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in the stores. Urban Outfitters also operates three web sites targeting our European customers.

The website accepts orders directly from customers and exposes consumers to all product offerings from the BHLDN concept. A retail store is planned to open during fiscal 2012. 27 Table of Contents Increases in our catalog circulation are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our direct to consumer customers to determine which customers respond to our catalog mailings. We also utilize the services of list rental companies to identify potential customers that will receive future catalogs. We believe that our web sites increase the reputation and recognition of our brands with our target customers and help support the strength of our stores operations. We plan on increasing our spending on investments in web marketing during fiscal 2012 for all of our brands. These increases will be based on our daily evaluation of the customers response rate to our marketing investments. Direct to consumer sales for all brands combined were approximately 19.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. Wholesale Operations The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. During fiscal 2011, Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk, and our own Free People stores.

Leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than 1% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. 28 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer channel is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be recorded in the future. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $11.4 million and $9.9 million, representing 3.0% and 2.9% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Held to maturity securities represent those securities that are held at amortized cost and that we have both the intent and the belief that it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security prior to its maturity and recovery of full amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income. Available for sale securities represent securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity, are not actively traded and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current have maturity dates of 29 Table of Contents less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non current have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as ARS that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as non current assets. Successful auctions would be classified as current assets. All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2011 and 2010 were classified as available for sale. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts, and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria utilized by the Company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle, and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $229.6 million and $186.1 million, representing 12.8% and 11.4% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2011 were performed as of June 2010 and January 2011. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $586.3 million and $540.0 million, respectively, representing 32.7% and 33.0% of total assets, respectively. 30 Table of Contents In assessing potential impairment of our store related assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened. If economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. As of the date of this report, all of our stores are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 totaled $52.1 million and $43.6 million, respectively, representing 2.9% and 2.7% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.6 million as of January 31, 2011 from $2.2 million as of January 31, 2010. This increase is based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgement to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgements and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 31 Table of Contents Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We account for contingencies such as these in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 58.8 59.4 61.1 Gross profit 41.2 40.6 38.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.0 23.1 22.6 Income from operations 18.2 17.5 16.3 Interest income 0.1 0.3 0.6 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 18.3 17.8 16.9 Income tax expense 6.3 6.4 6.0 Net income 12.0 % 11.4 % 10.9 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 17.4 % 5.6 % 21.7 % Gross profit 19.1 % 10.2 % 23.7 % Income from operations 22.2 % 13.2 % 33.1 % Net income 24.1 % 10.3 % 24.4 % 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased by 17.4% to $2.27 billion, from $1.94 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $336 million increase was attributable to a $320 million or 17.5% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $16 million or 15.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2011 was driven by increases of $161 million in non comparable and new store net sales, $110 million, or 34.0%, in direct to consumer net sales and $49 million, or 4%, in comparable store net sales. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 9.8%, 6.9% and 26.7% increases at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People respectively. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $15 million, or a 15.9% increase, at Free People wholesale and a $1.0 million, or an 11.9% increase, at Leifsdottir wholesale. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2011. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions and units sold per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit sales prices. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2011 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 2.8 million, or 7.7%. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, comparable retail segment net sales are low single digit negative. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottirs wholesale net sales increase was a result of an increase in the number of transactions that more than offset a decrease in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2011 increased to 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, from 40.6% of net sales, or $786 million, in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leveraging of store occupancy expense driven by positive comparable store sales. Total Company inventory increased 23.3% to $230 million from $186 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores and our direct to consumer channel growth. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 9.7%, while comparable store inventories increased 4.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011, decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 23.1% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in percentage was primarily due to leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable costs driven by the positive retail segment comparable sales. In fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75 million, to $522 million, from $447 million in the prior fiscal year. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011 compared to 17.5% of net sales, or $339 million, for fiscal 2010. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2011 decreased to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.2% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2010. This decrease was due to the favorable mix of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions and the federal rehabilitation credit included in fiscal 2011. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to 33 Table of Contents our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be higher than that of fiscal 2011 due in part to the expiration of the federal rehabilitation credit received in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 5.6%, to $1.94 billion from $1.83 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $103 million increase was attributable to a $109 million or 6.3% increase, in retail segment net sales that was partially offset by a $6 million or 5.4% decline in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2010 was driven by an increase of $115 million in non comparable and new store net sales, and an increase in direct to consumer net sales of $53 million or 19.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $35 million or 2.6% in comparable store net sales and $24 million of foreign currency translation adjustments. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 3.3% and 7.1% increases at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively, partially offset by a 1.0% decrease at Urban Outfitters. The decline in our wholesale segment net sales was due to an $11 million or 10.6% decline at Free People wholesale that was partially offset by an increase of $5 million or 185% at Leifsdottir. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 and 49 new stores in fiscal 2009 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2010. Comparable store net sales decreases were primarily the result of decreases in the number of units sold per transaction, that were partially offset by slight increases in average unit sales prices and transactions. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2010 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our web sites, which more than offset decreases in conversion rate and average order value. Catalog circulation across all brands decreased by 3 million or 8.2%. The decrease in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by decreases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottir wholesale net sales increase was a result of increased transactions that more than offset a decline in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2010 increased to 40.6% of net sales or $786 million from 38.9% of net sales or $713 million in fiscal 2009. This improvement is primarily due to improvements in our initial merchandise margins which were partially offset by a higher rate of store occupancy expense driven by the decrease in comparable store sales. Total inventories at January 31, 2010 increased by $16 million or 9.7% to $186 million from $170 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non comparable stores. Comparable store inventory at cost decreased by 3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 increased to 23.1% of net sales or $447 million versus 22.6% of net sales or $414 million for fiscal 2009. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in incentive based compensation that relates to meeting targeted operating performance goals in fiscal 2010. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 17.5% of net sales or $339 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 16.3% of net sales or $299 million for fiscal 2009. Our annual effective income tax rate increased to 36.2% of income for fiscal 2010 compared to 35.6% of income for fiscal 2009. The increase in fiscal 2010s tax rate is primarily due to a lower 34 Table of Contents proportion of tax free interest income due to a strategic shift to a mix of lower risk securities versus the prior years holdings. See Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $809 million as of January 31, 2011 as compared to $745 million as of January 31, 2010 and $521 million as of January 31, 2009. The $64 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of $385 million from cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $205 million of cash used for share repurchases and $144 million of cash used for property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2011 was $36 million, consisting of $144 million used primarily for the construction of new stores partially offset by $108 million in net proceeds from marketable securities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 of $168 million was primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program partially offset by cash provided by the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises. Our working capital for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $593 million, $618 million and $483 million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also used our cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. We continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, wholesale businesses, distribution facilities, home office and our international subsidiaries. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances, included in deferred rent, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $144 million, $109 million, and $113 million respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2012, we plan to construct and open approximately 50 to 55 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, construct additional distribution and fulfillment facilities in Rushden, England and Reno, Nevada, continue to expand our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, upgrade our systems, increase our catalog circulation by approximately 9 million catalogs to approximately 49 million catalogs, and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 to approximately $188 million. We believe that our new store, catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office, fulfillment and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. During fiscal 2011, we completed a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at a cost of approximately $25 million. During fiscal 2010, we completed a 100,000 square foot addition to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania distribution facility. This facility primarily serves our Midwest and East coast stores. We believe this expansion will help support our growth for the near term. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the Company to purchase up to 8.0 million common shares. We repurchased 1.2 million common shares during fiscal year 2007. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased and subsequently retired 35 Table of Contents 6.4 million common shares for $205.0 million. On November 16, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million additional common shares. This authorization supplements the Companys 2006 stock repurchase program. Subsequent to January 31, 2011 and through April 1, 2011, we repurchased and retired 4.8 million common shares for approximately $148.7 million. This activity completes our 2006 repurchase program and leaves approximately 5.6 million shares available for repurchase under the 2010 program. On September 21, 2009, we amended our renewed and amended line of credit facility (the Line) with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the Bank). This amendment added an additional borrower and certain additional guarantors. The Line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to $100.0 million at our discretion. On May 27, 2010, we executed a fifth amendment to the Line increasing its credit limit to $80.0 million. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.60% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. As of and during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $55.5 million as of January 31, 2011. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line totaled approximately $44.5 million as of January 31, 2011. We are negotiating a renewal of the Line with the Bank. As part of these negotiations, we were granted an extension of all of the existing terms, covenants and conditions of the Line through April, 2011. We expect the renewal to satisfy our letter of credit needs through at least 2014. We have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments. These obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under our line of credit facility, are expected to fund such obligations and commitments. The tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2011: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,280,955 $ 164,289 $ 480,931 $ 253,011 $ 382,724 Purchase orders (2) 278,079 278,079 Construction contracts (3) 18,004 18,004 Tax Contingencies (4) 798 798 Total contractual obligations $ 1,577,836 $ 461,170 $ 480,931 $ 253,011 $ 382,724 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease 36 Table of Contents payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 26 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 26 locations was approximately $4,705 for fiscal 2011. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 20 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2011. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $798 that are classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2011. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10,580 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $10,580 liability was classified as a non current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2011. Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 51,397 $ 51,397 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 4,081 4,081 Total commercial commitments $ 55,478 $ 55,478 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update which amends fair value measurements and disclosures and aims to improve the transparency of financial reporting of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The update requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and the basis for such transfers. Also required are disclosures for activity in Level 3 including purchase, sale, issuance and settlement 37 Table of Contents information. Lastly, it clarifies guidance regarding disaggregation and disclosure of information about valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements in Level 2 and Level 3 categories. We have adopted the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures as of February 1, 2010 which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. This adoption had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have not adopted the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements as these disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect this adoption to have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 38 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2011 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 Oct. 31,2010 Jan. 31,2011 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 479,961 $ 552,159 $ 573,592 $ 668,390 Gross profit 200,786 234,781 235,993 265,060 Net income 52,957 71,657 73,106 75,238 Net income per common share basic 0.31 0.42 0.44 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.31 0.42 0.43 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 24 % 25 % 30 % Net income 19 % 26 % 27 % 28 % Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2009 July 31,2009 Oct. 31,2009 Jan. 31,2010 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 384,796 $ 458,626 $ 505,900 $ 588,493 Gross profit 143,305 187,091 210,088 245,661 Net income 30,805 49,021 62,392 77,675 Net income per common share basic 0.18 0.29 0.37 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.18 0.29 0.36 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 20 % 24 % 26 % 30 % Net income 14 % 22 % 29 % 35 % (1) The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year to date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Companys inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases the majority of its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. 39 Table of Contents The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2011 the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, corporate bonds rated A or better, federal government agencies, pre refunded tax exempt municipal bonds rated A or better, treasury bills, auction rate securities rated A or better, which bear interest at a variable rate and FDIC insured corporate bonds. We believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. This is due to the conservative nature of the Companys investment portfolio and the fact that all securities, with the exception of ARS, mature in three years or less. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Approximately 3.6% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in A or better rated ARS that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. The Companys ARS had an amortized cost of $33.3 million and a fair value of $29.5 million, as of January 31, 2011. As of January 31, 2011, all of the ARS held by the Company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. As of January 31, 2010, the Company had $37.6 million of amortized cost and $33.5 million of fair value ARS. Liquidity for these ARS is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, usually 7, 28, 35 or 90 days. The principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs, the bond is called by the issuer, a buyer is found from outside the auction process, or the debt obligation reaches its maturity. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $3.8 million and $4.1 million of temporary impairment charges on our ARS as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. To date, we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe it is not likely to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, the Company has classified all ARS as non current assets under marketable securities. The Company continues to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of its investments.
