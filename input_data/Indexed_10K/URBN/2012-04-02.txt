Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources, were necessary to adequately support our growth. We believe we may need to further expand the square footage of our home office and distribution facilities to support our growth over the next several years. For more information on our distribution center properties, see Item 1: Business Company Operations Distribution. We believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition. All of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and BHLDN stores are leased, well maintained and in good operating condition. Our retail stores are typically leased for a term of ten years with renewal options for an additional five to ten years. Total estimated selling square feet for stores open, under lease as of January 31, 2012, by Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and BHLDN was approximately 1,770,000, 1,214,000, 85,000, 20,000 and 3,400, respectively. Terrain also utilizes two acres of outdoor space to sell seasonal items, live plants, accessories and outdoor furniture. The average store selling square feet is approximately 9,000 for Urban Outfitters, 7,200 for Anthropologie and 1,400 for Free People. Selling square feet can sometimes change due to floor moves, use of staircases, cash register configuration and other factors.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and BHLDN brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, websites, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division that, primarily, designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Our comparable retail segment net sales data includes our comparable store and comparable direct to consumer channels. A store is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct to consumer channel is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. Sales from stores and direct to consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store or channel are considered non comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2012 ended on January 31, 2012. Retail Store As of January 31, 2012, we operated 197 Urban Outfitters stores of which 157 were located in the United States, 10 were located in Canada and 30 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2012, we opened 21 new Urban Outfitters stores, 13 of which were located in the United States and 8 of which were located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Outfitters North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 31.4% and 5.9% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated 168 Anthropologie stores, of which 160 were located in the United States, 5 were located in Canada and 3 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2012 we opened 15 new Anthropologie stores, of which 13 were located in the United States, 1 was located in Canada and 1 was located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. 23 Table of Contents Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 32.8% and 0.9% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated 62 Free People stores, all of which were located in the United States. During fiscal 2012 we opened 20 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, intimates, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years some of which may be outside the United States. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated one Terrain garden center, which was located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. We anticipate opening a second Terrain garden center during the first half of fiscal 2013. Terrain garden center sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated one BHLDN store, which was located in Houston, Texas. BHLDN offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie and decoration. We opened a second BHLDN store in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. BHLDN store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 55 to 60 new stores during fiscal 2013, including 23 Urban Outfitters stores, 16 Free People stores, 14 Anthropologie stores, 1 BHLDN store and 1 Terrain garden center Direct to Consumer We operate a Direct to Consumer channel which generates sales directly through our websites and catalogs. We believe that our Direct to Consumer channel increases the reputation and recognition of our brands with our target customers and help support and strengthen our store operations. Direct to Consumer sales for all brands combined, increased 1.3% to approximately 20.4% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. We believe that our web marketing and social media initiatives are a significant contributor to our Direct to Consumer sales growth. For fiscal 2013 we plan to increase our investment in web marketing and social media initiatives for all of our brands. These increases will be based on our continual evaluation of the customers response rate to web marketing initiatives. During fiscal 2012 we circulated approximately 47.9 million catalogs across all brands. Our catalog circulation levels are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our Direct to Consumer customers to determine which customers respond to our catalog mailings. Accordingly, we plan to decrease our catalog circulation to approximately 44.7 million catalogs across all brands in fiscal 2013. 24 Table of Contents Anthropologie.

Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. 25 Table of Contents Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and cash flows and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer channel is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $11.0 million and $11.4 million, representing 2.6% and 3.0% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2012 and 2011, are classified available for sale and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income in the Consolidated 26 Table of Contents Statements of Income. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are considered temporary and therefore are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non current assets have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as auction rate securities that fail at auction and do not liquidate in the normal course are classified as non current assets. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that we utilize to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2012 and 2011 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $250.1 million and $229.6 million, representing 16.9% and 12.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to provisions related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2012 were performed as of June 2011 and January 2012. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $685.0 million and $586.3 million, respectively, representing 46.2% and 32.7% of total assets, respectively. 27 Table of Contents In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If financial results are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to selling, general and operating and administrative expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $63.9 million and $52.1 million, respectively, representing 4.3% and 2.9% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.8 million as of January 31, 2012 from $2.6 million as of January 31, 2011. Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to 28 Table of Contents issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Share Based Compensation Accounting for share based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We use a Lattice Binomial pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model uses assumptions including the risk free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life of the options. A Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance shares. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of share based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, we make certain estimates about the number of awards which will be granted under performance based incentive plans. We record expense for performance based shares based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised and could be materially different from share based compensation expense recorded in prior periods. We are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actual forfeiture rate is different from the estimate at the completion of the vesting period, the share based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 65.2 58.8 59.4 Gross profit 34.8 41.2 40.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.3 23.0 23.1 Income from operations 11.5 18.2 17.5 Interest income 0.2 0.1 0.3 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 11.7 18.3 17.8 Income tax expense 4.2 6.3 6.4 Net income 7.5 % 12.0 % 11.4 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 8.8 % 17.4 % 5.6 % Gross profit 8.1 % 19.1 % 10.2 % Income from operations 31.3 % 22.2 % 13.2 % Net income 32.1 % 24.1 % 10.3 % Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net sales in fiscal 2012 increased by 8.8% to $2.47 billion, from $2.27 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $200 million increase was attributable to a $187 million or 8.7% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $13 million or 10.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2012 was driven by increases of $175 million in non comparable and new store net sales and $71 million, or 16.4%, in direct to consumer net sales. A decrease of $59 million, or 3.8%, in comparable store net sales was a partial offset. The net increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of increases of 17.0% and 1.4% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively and a decrease of 3.2% at Anthropologie. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $16 million, or a 14.7% increase, at Free People wholesale, partially offset by a $3 million decrease at Leifsdottir wholesale resulting from the discontinuation of wholesale distribution of the Leifsdottir brand, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 57 new stores in fiscal 2012 and 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2012. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2012 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our websites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 4.1 million, or 9.3%. Comparable store net sales decrease was primarily the result of a 30 Table of Contents decrease in the average unit sales prices combined with a decrease in the number of transactions. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, comparable retail segment net sales are low single digit positive. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2012 decreased to 34.8% of net sales, or $861 million, from 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, in fiscal 2011. This decrease was principally due to increased merchandise markdowns to clear slow moving inventory, primarily associated with womens apparel inventory at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, as well as deleveraging of store occupancy expense as a result of negative comparable store net sales. Total Company inventory increased 8.9% to $250 million from $230 million in the prior year. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 1.8%, while comparable store inventories decreased 2.5%. The increase in total Company inventory is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores, our direct to consumer channel growth and the launch of our BHLDN brand. The decrease in comparable store inventory was a partial offset. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2012, increased to 23.3% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher marketing and related e commerce investments as well as the deleveraging of direct store controllable expenses driven by the negative comparable stores sales in fiscal 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive based compensation versus the prior fiscal year as well as an equity compensation expense reversal due to the departure of an executive officer. In fiscal 2012, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $54 million, or 10.2%, to $576 million, from $522 million in fiscal 2011. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations decreased to 11.5% of net sales, or $285 million, for fiscal 2012 compared to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2012 increased to 35.9% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 compared to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2011 effective tax rate was favorably affected by a non recurring federal rehabilitation credit relating to the expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be approximately 36.5%. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased by 17.4% to $2.27 billion, from $1.94 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $336 million increase was attributable to a $320 million or 17.5% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $16 million or 15.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2011 was driven by increases of $161 million in non comparable and new store net sales, $110 million, or 34.0%, in direct to consumer net sales and $49 million, or 4%, in comparable store net sales. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 9.8%, 6.9% and 26.7% increases at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People, respectively. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $15 million, or a 15.9% increase, at Free People wholesale and a $1.0 million, or an 11.9% increase, at Leifsdottir wholesale. 31 Table of Contents The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2011. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions and units sold per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit sales prices. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2011 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our websites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 2.8 million, or 7.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottirs wholesale net sales increase was a result of an increase in the number of transactions that more than offset a decrease in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2011 increased to 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, from 40.6% of net sales, or $786 million, in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leveraging of store occupancy expense driven by positive comparable store sales. Total Company inventory increased 23.3% to $230 million from $186 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores and our direct to consumer channel growth. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 9.7%, while comparable store inventories increased 4.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011, decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 23.1% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in percentage was primarily due to leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable costs driven by the positive retail segment comparable sales. In fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75 million, to $522 million, from $447 million in the prior fiscal year. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011 compared to 17.5% of net sales, or $339 million, for fiscal 2010. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2011 decreased to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.2% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2010. This decrease was due to the favorable mix of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions and the federal rehabilitation credit included in fiscal 2011. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $362 million as of January 31, 2012 as compared to $809 million as of January 31, 2011 and $745 million as of January 31, 2010. The $447 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of $545 million of cash used for repurchases of our common shares and $190 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $283 million of cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities, for fiscal 2012, decreased by $102 million to $283 million from $385 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income in fiscal 2012. Our working capital for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $364 million, $593 million and $618 32 Table of Contents million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes in the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2012 was $55 million, consisting of $245 million in net proceeds from marketable securities partially offset by $190 million used primarily for the construction of new stores and distribution and fulfillment facilities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2012 of $532 million was primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares. Cash provided by the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises was a partial offset. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to repurchase our common shares, open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, technology, distribution and fulfillment facilities, our home office and our international operations. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances, included in deferred rent, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $190 million, $144 million, and $109 million, respectively and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2013, we plan to construct and open approximately 55 to 60 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, complete construction of our fulfillment facility in Reno, Nevada, continue to expand our home offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, upgrade our systems, increase our investments in direct to consumer marketing and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 to approximately $210 million. We believe that our new store, direct to consumer and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office, fulfillment and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. During fiscal 2012, we completed the construction of a 98,000 square foot distribution center and a 142,000 square foot fulfillment center, each located in Rushden, England, at a combined cost of approximately $19 million. During fiscal 2011, we completed a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at a cost of approximately $25 million. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorized the Company to purchase up to 8.0 million common shares. On November 16, 2010 and August 25, 2011, our Board of Directors approved two separate stock repurchase authorizations of 10.0 million common shares. These additional authorizations supplemented the Companys 2006 stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 20.5 million common shares for approximately $538.3 million. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased and subsequently retired 6.3 million common shares for $201.0 million. We repurchased 1.2 million common shares during fiscal year 2007. As of January 31, 2012, there were no common shares available for repurchase under the program. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program, during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 and 2011, we settled and subsequently retired 0.3 million and 0.1 million 33 Table of Contents common shares at a total cost of $7.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, from employees to meet minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. On April 25, 2011, we amended our line of credit facility (the Line) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. This amendment extended the term of the Line for three years, increased the accordion feature from $100 million to $175 million, reduced the interest rate margin for certain cash advances and modified certain financial covenants and terms. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.50% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios such as adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. On October 31, 2011, we further amended the Line to revise certain financial covenants which included removing the limitation on share repurchases, as well as to join certain of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers and guarantors and release certain others. As of and during the year ended January 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $59.7 million as of January 31, 2012. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line was $115.3 million as of January 31, 2012. We expect the Line to satisfy our credit needs through at least fiscal 2014. Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,389,003 $ 185,047 $ 519,895 $ 263,462 $ 420,599 Purchase orders (2) 315,890 315,890 Construction contracts (3) 16,292 16,292 Tax Contingencies (4) 340 340 Total contractual obligations $ 1,721,525 $ 517,569 $ 519,895 $ 263,462 $ 420,599 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 30 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 30 locations was approximately $4,917 for fiscal 2012. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 36 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2012. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $340 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2012. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10,910 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $10,910 liability was classified as a non current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2012. 34 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 55,532 $ 55,532 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 4,153 4,153 Total commercial commitments $ 59,685 $ 59,685 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2012, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that amended fair value measurements and disclosures and aimed to improve the transparency of financial reporting of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The update required new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and the basis for such transfers. Also required are disclosures for activity in Level 3, including purchase, sale, issuance and settlement information. Lastly, it clarified guidance regarding disaggregation and disclosure of information about valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements in Level 2 and Level 3 categories. We adopted the provisions of this accounting standards update effective February 1, 2010, except for the requirement to disclose purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 measurements, which we adopted February 1, 2011. This adoption had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued an additional update that amended fair value measurements and disclosures. This amendment provides that the inputs and measures used to value assets that fall within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy be quantitatively presented. Application is required prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We are required to adopt this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Other than the change in presentation, this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires an increase in the prominence of other comprehensive income and its components within the financial statements. The update provides entities the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements. It also eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statements of shareholders equity. Application is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We are required to adopt this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Other than the change in presentation, this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income, with a more significant portion typically realized from August to December 31st of each year (the back to school and holiday periods). The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2012 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2011 July 31,2011 Oct. 31,2011 Jan. 31,2012 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 524,019 $ 609,181 $ 609,953 $ 730,648 Gross profit 193,365 231,090 216,103 219,978 Net income 38,624 56,693 50,679 39,255 Net income per common share basic 0.24 0.36 0.34 0.27 Net income per common share diluted 0.23 0.35 0.33 0.27 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 25 % 25 % 29 % Net income 21 % 31 % 27 % 21 % Fiscal 2011 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 Oct. 31,2010 Jan. 31,2011 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 479,961 $ 552,159 $ 573,592 $ 668,390 Gross profit 200,786 234,781 235,993 265,060 Net income 52,957 71,657 73,106 75,238 Net income per common share basic 0.31 0.42 0.44 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.31 0.42 0.43 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 24 % 25 % 30 % Net income 19 % 26 % 27 % 28 % (1) The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year to date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase substantially all of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for our stores located in Canada and Europe. 36 Table of Contents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, corporate bonds rated A or better, municipal and pre refunded municipal bonds rated A or better, auction rate securities (ARS) rated A or better, which bear interest at variable rates, treasury bills, certificates of deposit, federal government agencies, and commercial paper. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Our ARS are invested in A or better rated issuances that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. Our ARS had a par value and fair value of $23.0 million and $20.2 million as of January 31, 2012 and $33.3 million and $29.5 million as of January 31, 2011. As of January 31, 2012, all of the ARS we held failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $2.8 million of temporary impairment on our ARS as of January 31, 2012 and $3.8 million as of January 31, 2011. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, we have classified all ARS as non current assets under marketable securities. We continue to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of our investments.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and BHLDN brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, websites, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division that, primarily, designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Our comparable retail segment net sales data includes our comparable store and comparable direct to consumer channels. A store is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct to consumer channel is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. Sales from stores and direct to consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store or channel are considered non comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2012 ended on January 31, 2012. Retail Store As of January 31, 2012, we operated 197 Urban Outfitters stores of which 157 were located in the United States, 10 were located in Canada and 30 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2012, we opened 21 new Urban Outfitters stores, 13 of which were located in the United States and 8 of which were located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Outfitters North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 31.4% and 5.9% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated 168 Anthropologie stores, of which 160 were located in the United States, 5 were located in Canada and 3 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2012 we opened 15 new Anthropologie stores, of which 13 were located in the United States, 1 was located in Canada and 1 was located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. 23 Table of Contents Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 32.8% and 0.9% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated 62 Free People stores, all of which were located in the United States. During fiscal 2012 we opened 20 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, intimates, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years some of which may be outside the United States. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated one Terrain garden center, which was located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. We anticipate opening a second Terrain garden center during the first half of fiscal 2013. Terrain garden center sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated one BHLDN store, which was located in Houston, Texas. BHLDN offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie and decoration. We opened a second BHLDN store in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. BHLDN store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 55 to 60 new stores during fiscal 2013, including 23 Urban Outfitters stores, 16 Free People stores, 14 Anthropologie stores, 1 BHLDN store and 1 Terrain garden center Direct to Consumer We operate a Direct to Consumer channel which generates sales directly through our websites and catalogs. We believe that our Direct to Consumer channel increases the reputation and recognition of our brands with our target customers and help support and strengthen our store operations. Direct to Consumer sales for all brands combined, increased 1.3% to approximately 20.4% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. We believe that our web marketing and social media initiatives are a significant contributor to our Direct to Consumer sales growth. For fiscal 2013 we plan to increase our investment in web marketing and social media initiatives for all of our brands. These increases will be based on our continual evaluation of the customers response rate to web marketing initiatives. During fiscal 2012 we circulated approximately 47.9 million catalogs across all brands. Our catalog circulation levels are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our Direct to Consumer customers to determine which customers respond to our catalog mailings. Accordingly, we plan to decrease our catalog circulation to approximately 44.7 million catalogs across all brands in fiscal 2013. 24 Table of Contents Anthropologie.

Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. 25 Table of Contents Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and cash flows and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer channel is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $11.0 million and $11.4 million, representing 2.6% and 3.0% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2012 and 2011, are classified available for sale and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income in the Consolidated 26 Table of Contents Statements of Income. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are considered temporary and therefore are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non current assets have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as auction rate securities that fail at auction and do not liquidate in the normal course are classified as non current assets. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that we utilize to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2012 and 2011 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $250.1 million and $229.6 million, representing 16.9% and 12.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to provisions related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2012 were performed as of June 2011 and January 2012. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $685.0 million and $586.3 million, respectively, representing 46.2% and 32.7% of total assets, respectively. 27 Table of Contents In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If financial results are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to selling, general and operating and administrative expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $63.9 million and $52.1 million, respectively, representing 4.3% and 2.9% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.8 million as of January 31, 2012 from $2.6 million as of January 31, 2011. Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to 28 Table of Contents issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Share Based Compensation Accounting for share based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We use a Lattice Binomial pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model uses assumptions including the risk free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life of the options. A Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance shares. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of share based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, we make certain estimates about the number of awards which will be granted under performance based incentive plans. We record expense for performance based shares based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised and could be materially different from share based compensation expense recorded in prior periods. We are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actual forfeiture rate is different from the estimate at the completion of the vesting period, the share based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 65.2 58.8 59.4 Gross profit 34.8 41.2 40.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.3 23.0 23.1 Income from operations 11.5 18.2 17.5 Interest income 0.2 0.1 0.3 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 11.7 18.3 17.8 Income tax expense 4.2 6.3 6.4 Net income 7.5 % 12.0 % 11.4 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 8.8 % 17.4 % 5.6 % Gross profit 8.1 % 19.1 % 10.2 % Income from operations 31.3 % 22.2 % 13.2 % Net income 32.1 % 24.1 % 10.3 % Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net sales in fiscal 2012 increased by 8.8% to $2.47 billion, from $2.27 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $200 million increase was attributable to a $187 million or 8.7% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $13 million or 10.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2012 was driven by increases of $175 million in non comparable and new store net sales and $71 million, or 16.4%, in direct to consumer net sales. A decrease of $59 million, or 3.8%, in comparable store net sales was a partial offset. The net increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of increases of 17.0% and 1.4% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively and a decrease of 3.2% at Anthropologie. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $16 million, or a 14.7% increase, at Free People wholesale, partially offset by a $3 million decrease at Leifsdottir wholesale resulting from the discontinuation of wholesale distribution of the Leifsdottir brand, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 57 new stores in fiscal 2012 and 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2012. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2012 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our websites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 4.1 million, or 9.3%. Comparable store net sales decrease was primarily the result of a 30 Table of Contents decrease in the average unit sales prices combined with a decrease in the number of transactions. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, comparable retail segment net sales are low single digit positive. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2012 decreased to 34.8% of net sales, or $861 million, from 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, in fiscal 2011. This decrease was principally due to increased merchandise markdowns to clear slow moving inventory, primarily associated with womens apparel inventory at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, as well as deleveraging of store occupancy expense as a result of negative comparable store net sales. Total Company inventory increased 8.9% to $250 million from $230 million in the prior year. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 1.8%, while comparable store inventories decreased 2.5%. The increase in total Company inventory is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores, our direct to consumer channel growth and the launch of our BHLDN brand. The decrease in comparable store inventory was a partial offset. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2012, increased to 23.3% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher marketing and related e commerce investments as well as the deleveraging of direct store controllable expenses driven by the negative comparable stores sales in fiscal 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive based compensation versus the prior fiscal year as well as an equity compensation expense reversal due to the departure of an executive officer. In fiscal 2012, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $54 million, or 10.2%, to $576 million, from $522 million in fiscal 2011. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations decreased to 11.5% of net sales, or $285 million, for fiscal 2012 compared to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2012 increased to 35.9% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 compared to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2011 effective tax rate was favorably affected by a non recurring federal rehabilitation credit relating to the expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be approximately 36.5%. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased by 17.4% to $2.27 billion, from $1.94 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $336 million increase was attributable to a $320 million or 17.5% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $16 million or 15.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2011 was driven by increases of $161 million in non comparable and new store net sales, $110 million, or 34.0%, in direct to consumer net sales and $49 million, or 4%, in comparable store net sales. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 9.8%, 6.9% and 26.7% increases at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People, respectively. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $15 million, or a 15.9% increase, at Free People wholesale and a $1.0 million, or an 11.9% increase, at Leifsdottir wholesale. 31 Table of Contents The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2011. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions and units sold per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit sales prices. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2011 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our websites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 2.8 million, or 7.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottirs wholesale net sales increase was a result of an increase in the number of transactions that more than offset a decrease in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2011 increased to 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, from 40.6% of net sales, or $786 million, in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leveraging of store occupancy expense driven by positive comparable store sales. Total Company inventory increased 23.3% to $230 million from $186 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores and our direct to consumer channel growth. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 9.7%, while comparable store inventories increased 4.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011, decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 23.1% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in percentage was primarily due to leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable costs driven by the positive retail segment comparable sales. In fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75 million, to $522 million, from $447 million in the prior fiscal year. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011 compared to 17.5% of net sales, or $339 million, for fiscal 2010. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2011 decreased to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.2% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2010. This decrease was due to the favorable mix of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions and the federal rehabilitation credit included in fiscal 2011. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $362 million as of January 31, 2012 as compared to $809 million as of January 31, 2011 and $745 million as of January 31, 2010. The $447 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of $545 million of cash used for repurchases of our common shares and $190 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $283 million of cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities, for fiscal 2012, decreased by $102 million to $283 million from $385 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income in fiscal 2012. Our working capital for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $364 million, $593 million and $618 32 Table of Contents million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes in the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2012 was $55 million, consisting of $245 million in net proceeds from marketable securities partially offset by $190 million used primarily for the construction of new stores and distribution and fulfillment facilities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2012 of $532 million was primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares. Cash provided by the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises was a partial offset. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to repurchase our common shares, open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, technology, distribution and fulfillment facilities, our home office and our international operations. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances, included in deferred rent, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $190 million, $144 million, and $109 million, respectively and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2013, we plan to construct and open approximately 55 to 60 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, complete construction of our fulfillment facility in Reno, Nevada, continue to expand our home offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, upgrade our systems, increase our investments in direct to consumer marketing and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 to approximately $210 million. We believe that our new store, direct to consumer and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office, fulfillment and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. During fiscal 2012, we completed the construction of a 98,000 square foot distribution center and a 142,000 square foot fulfillment center, each located in Rushden, England, at a combined cost of approximately $19 million. During fiscal 2011, we completed a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at a cost of approximately $25 million. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorized the Company to purchase up to 8.0 million common shares. On November 16, 2010 and August 25, 2011, our Board of Directors approved two separate stock repurchase authorizations of 10.0 million common shares. These additional authorizations supplemented the Companys 2006 stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 20.5 million common shares for approximately $538.3 million. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased and subsequently retired 6.3 million common shares for $201.0 million. We repurchased 1.2 million common shares during fiscal year 2007. As of January 31, 2012, there were no common shares available for repurchase under the program. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program, during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 and 2011, we settled and subsequently retired 0.3 million and 0.1 million 33 Table of Contents common shares at a total cost of $7.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, from employees to meet minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. On April 25, 2011, we amended our line of credit facility (the Line) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. This amendment extended the term of the Line for three years, increased the accordion feature from $100 million to $175 million, reduced the interest rate margin for certain cash advances and modified certain financial covenants and terms. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.50% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios such as adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. On October 31, 2011, we further amended the Line to revise certain financial covenants which included removing the limitation on share repurchases, as well as to join certain of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers and guarantors and release certain others. As of and during the year ended January 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $59.7 million as of January 31, 2012. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line was $115.3 million as of January 31, 2012. We expect the Line to satisfy our credit needs through at least fiscal 2014. Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,389,003 $ 185,047 $ 519,895 $ 263,462 $ 420,599 Purchase orders (2) 315,890 315,890 Construction contracts (3) 16,292 16,292 Tax Contingencies (4) 340 340 Total contractual obligations $ 1,721,525 $ 517,569 $ 519,895 $ 263,462 $ 420,599 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 30 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 30 locations was approximately $4,917 for fiscal 2012. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 36 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2012. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $340 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2012. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10,910 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $10,910 liability was classified as a non current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2012. 34 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 55,532 $ 55,532 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 4,153 4,153 Total commercial commitments $ 59,685 $ 59,685 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2012, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that amended fair value measurements and disclosures and aimed to improve the transparency of financial reporting of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The update required new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and the basis for such transfers. Also required are disclosures for activity in Level 3, including purchase, sale, issuance and settlement information. Lastly, it clarified guidance regarding disaggregation and disclosure of information about valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements in Level 2 and Level 3 categories. We adopted the provisions of this accounting standards update effective February 1, 2010, except for the requirement to disclose purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 measurements, which we adopted February 1, 2011. This adoption had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued an additional update that amended fair value measurements and disclosures. This amendment provides that the inputs and measures used to value assets that fall within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy be quantitatively presented. Application is required prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We are required to adopt this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Other than the change in presentation, this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires an increase in the prominence of other comprehensive income and its components within the financial statements. The update provides entities the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements. It also eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statements of shareholders equity. Application is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We are required to adopt this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Other than the change in presentation, this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income, with a more significant portion typically realized from August to December 31st of each year (the back to school and holiday periods). The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase substantially all of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for our stores located in Canada and Europe. 36 Table of Contents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, corporate bonds rated A or better, municipal and pre refunded municipal bonds rated A or better, auction rate securities (ARS) rated A or better, which bear interest at variable rates, treasury bills, certificates of deposit, federal government agencies, and commercial paper. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Our ARS are invested in A or better rated issuances that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. Our ARS had a par value and fair value of $23.0 million and $20.2 million as of January 31, 2012 and $33.3 million and $29.5 million as of January 31, 2011. As of January 31, 2012, all of the ARS we held failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $2.8 million of temporary impairment on our ARS as of January 31, 2012 and $3.8 million as of January 31, 2011. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, we have classified all ARS as non current assets under marketable securities. We continue to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of our investments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We operate two business segments; a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment. Our retailing segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and BHLDN brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores, websites, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our wholesale apparel segment consists of our Free People wholesale division that, primarily, designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Our comparable retail segment net sales data includes our comparable store and comparable direct to consumer channels. A store is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct to consumer channel is included in comparable retail segment net sales data, as presented in this discussion, if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. Sales from stores and direct to consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store or channel are considered non comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non comparable. Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. Transaction volume changes may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our web advertising, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2012 ended on January 31, 2012. Retail Store As of January 31, 2012, we operated 197 Urban Outfitters stores of which 157 were located in the United States, 10 were located in Canada and 30 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2012, we opened 21 new Urban Outfitters stores, 13 of which were located in the United States and 8 of which were located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Outfitters North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 31.4% and 5.9% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated 168 Anthropologie stores, of which 160 were located in the United States, 5 were located in Canada and 3 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2012 we opened 15 new Anthropologie stores, of which 13 were located in the United States, 1 was located in Canada and 1 was located in Europe. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. 23 Table of Contents Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 32.8% and 0.9% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated 62 Free People stores, all of which were located in the United States. During fiscal 2012 we opened 20 new Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, intimates, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years some of which may be outside the United States. Free Peoples retail store sales accounted for approximately 2.7% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated one Terrain garden center, which was located in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Terrain is designed to appeal to customers interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain seeks to create a compelling shopping environment, inspired by the greenhouse. The site is large and free standing. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. We anticipate opening a second Terrain garden center during the first half of fiscal 2013. Terrain garden center sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. As of January 31, 2012, we operated one BHLDN store, which was located in Houston, Texas. BHLDN offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie and decoration. We opened a second BHLDN store in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. BHLDN store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 55 to 60 new stores during fiscal 2013, including 23 Urban Outfitters stores, 16 Free People stores, 14 Anthropologie stores, 1 BHLDN store and 1 Terrain garden center Direct to Consumer We operate a Direct to Consumer channel which generates sales directly through our websites and catalogs. We believe that our Direct to Consumer channel increases the reputation and recognition of our brands with our target customers and help support and strengthen our store operations. Direct to Consumer sales for all brands combined, increased 1.3% to approximately 20.4% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. We believe that our web marketing and social media initiatives are a significant contributor to our Direct to Consumer sales growth. For fiscal 2013 we plan to increase our investment in web marketing and social media initiatives for all of our brands. These increases will be based on our continual evaluation of the customers response rate to web marketing initiatives. During fiscal 2012 we circulated approximately 47.9 million catalogs across all brands. Our catalog circulation levels are driven by our evaluation of the response rate to each individual catalog. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio as needed. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our Direct to Consumer customers to determine which customers respond to our catalog mailings. Accordingly, we plan to decrease our catalog circulation to approximately 44.7 million catalogs across all brands in fiscal 2013. 24 Table of Contents Anthropologie. Anthropologie operates a website, which accepts orders directly from customers. The website captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar yet broader array of womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings, gifts and decorative items as found in our stores.

During fiscal 2012, Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Belk and our own Free People stores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. 25 Table of Contents Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and cash flows and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer channel is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material. We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire. Sales Return Reserve We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit. The reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, additional sales returns would be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled $11.0 million and $11.4 million, representing 2.6% and 3.0% of total liabilities, respectively. Marketable Securities All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2012 and 2011, are classified available for sale and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income in the Consolidated 26 Table of Contents Statements of Income. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are considered temporary and therefore are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available for sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non current assets have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available for sale securities such as auction rate securities that fail at auction and do not liquidate in the normal course are classified as non current assets. Inventories We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first in, first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that we utilize to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2012 and 2011 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $250.1 million and $229.6 million, representing 16.9% and 12.8% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results. Adjustments to provisions related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our physical inventories for fiscal 2012 were performed as of June 2011 and January 2012. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories. Long Lived Assets Our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $685.0 million and $586.3 million, respectively, representing 46.2% and 32.7% of total assets, respectively. 27 Table of Contents In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. If financial results are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, write downs of long lived assets were not material. We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to selling, general and operating and administrative expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2011 totaled $63.9 million and $52.1 million, respectively, representing 4.3% and 2.9% of total assets, respectively. To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We increased valuation allowances to $2.8 million as of January 31, 2012 from $2.6 million as of January 31, 2011. Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate. Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Accounting for Contingencies From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to 28 Table of Contents issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. Share Based Compensation Accounting for share based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We use a Lattice Binomial pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model uses assumptions including the risk free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life of the options. A Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance shares. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of share based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Additionally, we make certain estimates about the number of awards which will be granted under performance based incentive plans. We record expense for performance based shares based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised and could be materially different from share based compensation expense recorded in prior periods. We are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actual forfeiture rate is different from the estimate at the completion of the vesting period, the share based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations As a Percentage of Net Sales The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs 65.2 58.8 59.4 Gross profit 34.8 41.2 40.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.3 23.0 23.1 Income from operations 11.5 18.2 17.5 Interest income 0.2 0.1 0.3 Other income Other expenses Income before income taxes 11.7 18.3 17.8 Income tax expense 4.2 6.3 6.4 Net income 7.5 % 12.0 % 11.4 % Period over Period Change: Net sales 8.8 % 17.4 % 5.6 % Gross profit 8.1 % 19.1 % 10.2 % Income from operations 31.3 % 22.2 % 13.2 % Net income 32.1 % 24.1 % 10.3 % Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net sales in fiscal 2012 increased by 8.8% to $2.47 billion, from $2.27 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $200 million increase was attributable to a $187 million or 8.7% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $13 million or 10.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2012 was driven by increases of $175 million in non comparable and new store net sales and $71 million, or 16.4%, in direct to consumer net sales. A decrease of $59 million, or 3.8%, in comparable store net sales was a partial offset. The net increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of increases of 17.0% and 1.4% at Free People and Urban Outfitters, respectively and a decrease of 3.2% at Anthropologie. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $16 million, or a 14.7% increase, at Free People wholesale, partially offset by a $3 million decrease at Leifsdottir wholesale resulting from the discontinuation of wholesale distribution of the Leifsdottir brand, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 57 new stores in fiscal 2012 and 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2012. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2012 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our websites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 4.1 million, or 9.3%. Comparable store net sales decrease was primarily the result of a 30 Table of Contents decrease in the average unit sales prices combined with a decrease in the number of transactions. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, comparable retail segment net sales are low single digit positive. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2012 decreased to 34.8% of net sales, or $861 million, from 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, in fiscal 2011. This decrease was principally due to increased merchandise markdowns to clear slow moving inventory, primarily associated with womens apparel inventory at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, as well as deleveraging of store occupancy expense as a result of negative comparable store net sales. Total Company inventory increased 8.9% to $250 million from $230 million in the prior year. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 1.8%, while comparable store inventories decreased 2.5%. The increase in total Company inventory is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores, our direct to consumer channel growth and the launch of our BHLDN brand. The decrease in comparable store inventory was a partial offset. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2012, increased to 23.3% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher marketing and related e commerce investments as well as the deleveraging of direct store controllable expenses driven by the negative comparable stores sales in fiscal 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive based compensation versus the prior fiscal year as well as an equity compensation expense reversal due to the departure of an executive officer. In fiscal 2012, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $54 million, or 10.2%, to $576 million, from $522 million in fiscal 2011. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations decreased to 11.5% of net sales, or $285 million, for fiscal 2012 compared to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2012 increased to 35.9% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 compared to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2011 effective tax rate was favorably affected by a non recurring federal rehabilitation credit relating to the expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be approximately 36.5%. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales in fiscal 2011 increased by 17.4% to $2.27 billion, from $1.94 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $336 million increase was attributable to a $320 million or 17.5% increase, in retail segment net sales and a $16 million or 15.6% increase in our wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our retail segment net sales during fiscal 2011 was driven by increases of $161 million in non comparable and new store net sales, $110 million, or 34.0%, in direct to consumer net sales and $49 million, or 4%, in comparable store net sales. The increase in comparable retail segment net sales was comprised of 9.8%, 6.9% and 26.7% increases at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People, respectively. The increase in our wholesale segment net sales was due to a $15 million, or a 15.9% increase, at Free People wholesale and a $1.0 million, or an 11.9% increase, at Leifsdottir wholesale. 31 Table of Contents The increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 and 33 new stores in fiscal 2010 that were considered non comparable during fiscal 2011. Comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions and units sold per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit sales prices. Direct to consumer net sales in fiscal year 2011 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our websites combined with an increase in average order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 2.8 million, or 7.7%. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices. Leifsdottirs wholesale net sales increase was a result of an increase in the number of transactions that more than offset a decrease in average unit sale prices. Gross profit rates in fiscal 2011 increased to 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, from 40.6% of net sales, or $786 million, in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to improved merchandise margins and leveraging of store occupancy expense driven by positive comparable store sales. Total Company inventory increased 23.3% to $230 million from $186 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores and our direct to consumer channel growth. Comparable retail segment inventory (which includes our direct to consumer channel) grew 9.7%, while comparable store inventories increased 4.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011, decreased to 23.0% of net sales versus 23.1% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in percentage was primarily due to leveraging of direct store fixed and controllable costs driven by the positive retail segment comparable sales. In fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75 million, to $522 million, from $447 million in the prior fiscal year. The dollar increase versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non comparable stores. Income from operations increased to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011 compared to 17.5% of net sales, or $339 million, for fiscal 2010. Our annual effective income tax rate for January 31, 2011 decreased to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.2% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2010. This decrease was due to the favorable mix of earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions and the federal rehabilitation credit included in fiscal 2011. See Note 8 Income Taxes in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $362 million as of January 31, 2012 as compared to $809 million as of January 31, 2011 and $745 million as of January 31, 2010. The $447 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of $545 million of cash used for repurchases of our common shares and $190 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $283 million of cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities, for fiscal 2012, decreased by $102 million to $283 million from $385 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income in fiscal 2012. Our working capital for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $364 million, $593 million and $618 32 Table of Contents million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes in the volume of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals. Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2012 was $55 million, consisting of $245 million in net proceeds from marketable securities partially offset by $190 million used primarily for the construction of new stores and distribution and fulfillment facilities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2012 of $532 million was primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares. Cash provided by the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises was a partial offset. During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been to repurchase our common shares, open new stores and purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts, technology, distribution and fulfillment facilities, our home office and our international operations. Cash paid for property and equipment, net of tenant improvement allowances, included in deferred rent, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $190 million, $144 million, and $109 million, respectively and were primarily used to expand and support our store base. During fiscal 2013, we plan to construct and open approximately 55 to 60 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, complete construction of our fulfillment facility in Reno, Nevada, continue to expand our home offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, upgrade our systems, increase our investments in direct to consumer marketing and purchase inventory for our stores, direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 to approximately $210 million. We believe that our new store, direct to consumer and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe improvements to our home office, fulfillment and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brands. During fiscal 2012, we completed the construction of a 98,000 square foot distribution center and a 142,000 square foot fulfillment center, each located in Rushden, England, at a combined cost of approximately $19 million. During fiscal 2011, we completed a 54,000 square foot expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at a cost of approximately $25 million. On February 28, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The program authorized the Company to purchase up to 8.0 million common shares. On November 16, 2010 and August 25, 2011, our Board of Directors approved two separate stock repurchase authorizations of 10.0 million common shares. These additional authorizations supplemented the Companys 2006 stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 20.5 million common shares for approximately $538.3 million. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased and subsequently retired 6.3 million common shares for $201.0 million. We repurchased 1.2 million common shares during fiscal year 2007. As of January 31, 2012, there were no common shares available for repurchase under the program. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program, during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 and 2011, we settled and subsequently retired 0.3 million and 0.1 million 33 Table of Contents common shares at a total cost of $7.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, from employees to meet minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. On April 25, 2011, we amended our line of credit facility (the Line) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. This amendment extended the term of the Line for three years, increased the accordion feature from $100 million to $175 million, reduced the interest rate margin for certain cash advances and modified certain financial covenants and terms. The Line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.50% based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios such as adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends. On October 31, 2011, we further amended the Line to revise certain financial covenants which included removing the limitation on share repurchases, as well as to join certain of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers and guarantors and release certain others. As of and during the year ended January 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $59.7 million as of January 31, 2012. The available credit, including the accordion feature, under the Line was $115.3 million as of January 31, 2012. We expect the Line to satisfy our credit needs through at least fiscal 2014. Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Description TotalObligations Less ThanOneYear One toThreeYears Three toFiveYears More ThanFiveYears Operating leases (1) $ 1,389,003 $ 185,047 $ 519,895 $ 263,462 $ 420,599 Purchase orders (2) 315,890 315,890 Construction contracts (3) 16,292 16,292 Tax Contingencies (4) 340 340 Total contractual obligations $ 1,721,525 $ 517,569 $ 519,895 $ 263,462 $ 420,599 (1) Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 30 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 30 locations was approximately $4,917 for fiscal 2012. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term. The table above includes our best estimate of the future payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 36 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2012. (2) Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date. (3) Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months. (4) Tax contingencies include $340 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2012. Tax contingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $10,910 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $10,910 liability was classified as a non current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2012. 34 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments Description TotalAmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Per Period(in thousands) LessThanOneYear OnetoThreeYears ThreetoFiveYears MoreThanFiveYears Line of credit (1) $ 55,532 $ 55,532 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 4,153 4,153 Total commercial commitments $ 59,685 $ 59,685 $ $ $ (1) Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2012, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that amended fair value measurements and disclosures and aimed to improve the transparency of financial reporting of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The update required new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and the basis for such transfers. Also required are disclosures for activity in Level 3, including purchase, sale, issuance and settlement information. Lastly, it clarified guidance regarding disaggregation and disclosure of information about valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements in Level 2 and Level 3 categories. We adopted the provisions of this accounting standards update effective February 1, 2010, except for the requirement to disclose purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 measurements, which we adopted February 1, 2011. This adoption had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued an additional update that amended fair value measurements and disclosures. This amendment provides that the inputs and measures used to value assets that fall within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy be quantitatively presented. Application is required prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We are required to adopt this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Other than the change in presentation, this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires an increase in the prominence of other comprehensive income and its components within the financial statements. The update provides entities the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements. It also eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statements of shareholders equity. Application is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We are required to adopt this update in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Other than the change in presentation, this accounting standards update will not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. 35 Table of Contents Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income, with a more significant portion typically realized from August to December 31st of each year (the back to school and holiday periods). The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10 Q and Article 10 of Regulation S X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Fiscal 2012 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2011 July 31,2011 Oct. 31,2011 Jan. 31,2012 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 524,019 $ 609,181 $ 609,953 $ 730,648 Gross profit 193,365 231,090 216,103 219,978 Net income 38,624 56,693 50,679 39,255 Net income per common share basic 0.24 0.36 0.34 0.27 Net income per common share diluted 0.23 0.35 0.33 0.27 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 25 % 25 % 29 % Net income 21 % 31 % 27 % 21 % Fiscal 2011 Quarter Ended (1) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 Oct. 31,2010 Jan. 31,2011 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net sales $ 479,961 $ 552,159 $ 573,592 $ 668,390 Gross profit 200,786 234,781 235,993 265,060 Net income 52,957 71,657 73,106 75,238 Net income per common share basic 0.31 0.42 0.44 0.46 Net income per common share diluted 0.31 0.42 0.43 0.45 As a Percentage of Fiscal Year: Net sales 21 % 24 % 25 % 30 % Net income 19 % 26 % 27 % 28 % (1) The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year to date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase substantially all of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for our stores located in Canada and Europe. 36 Table of Contents Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, corporate bonds rated A or better, municipal and pre refunded municipal bonds rated A or better, auction rate securities (ARS) rated A or better, which bear interest at variable rates, treasury bills, certificates of deposit, federal government agencies, and commercial paper. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments. Our ARS are invested in A or better rated issuances that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations, all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to 97% or greater of par value. Our ARS had a par value and fair value of $23.0 million and $20.2 million as of January 31, 2012 and $33.3 million and $29.5 million as of January 31, 2011. As of January 31, 2012, all of the ARS we held failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we have recorded $2.8 million of temporary impairment on our ARS as of January 31, 2012 and $3.8 million as of January 31, 2011. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost. As a result of the current illiquidity, we have classified all ARS as non current assets under marketable securities. We continue to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of our investments.
