Inc., deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination. (2) Visa U.S.A. recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal 2005 related to its membership interest in Visa International and in fiscal 2004 related to Visa U.S.A. changing its method of amortizing volume and support agreements. These accounting changes resulted in additional net income of $96 million in fiscal 2005 and a $6 million decrease to net income in fiscal 2004. (3) The long term portion of Visa U.S.A. debt was classified as being due within one year at September 30, 2007 because Visa U.S.A. was in default of certain financial performance covenants as a result of the settlement of the American Express litigation as described in Note 23 Legal Matters to Visa Inc.s audited financial statements included in Item 8 of in this report. 49 Table of Contents We believe that payments volume and transactions processed are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the primary basis for service fee revenue. Payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with cards bearing our brands. Transactions processed by VisaNet are the primary basis for data processing revenue. The tables below set forth payments volume and transaction volume for Visa Inc. and Visa U.S.A., deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination and certain pro forma comparable payments volume and transaction information for Visa Inc.

(6) Prior to the business combination, there were multiple transaction measures used by different participants in the business combination. The Company adopted a consistent transaction measurement methodology effective with the business combination on October 1, 2007 and Visa U.S.A. conformed to this methodology. Historical comparable transactional data prior to fiscal 2006 is unavailable. (7) There is no historical combined statement of operations of Visa Inc. prior to October 1, 2007, because Visa Inc. did not have any operations prior to the reorganization. In order to provide insight into our operating results and trends affecting our business, we have included the pro forma selected statement of operations data for fiscal 2007, as if the reorganization had occurred on October 1, 2006. This pro forma information is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and presented in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141). 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Historical and Pro Forma Financial Condition and Results of Operations Transparency and clarity are integral to successful financial reporting and we continually strive to provide informative financial disclosures with an accurate view of our operating results and financial position. Our managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our, and the Company) on a historical and pro forma basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. Our MD&A is presented in nine sections: Overview Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations Related Parties Critical Accounting Estimates Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Visa Inc.s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview Visa operates the worlds largest retail electronic payments network and manages the worlds most recognized global financial services brand. We provide financial institutions with platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation will continue to yield significant growth opportunities. We will continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visas ability to compete, Visa consummated a reorganization in October 2007 in which Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Canada and Inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc., a Delaware stock corporation. Visa Europe remained an independent company owned by its financial institutions. To further enhance our competitive position, we successfully completed an IPO in March 2008. Further details of our reorganization and IPO are discussed below in The Reorganization and IPO. We believe that successful completion of the reorganization and IPO position us to best execute our business strategy. The global alignment of various functions and best practices subsequent to the IPO provides us the business scale to effectively deliver our existing core products across more and different geographies in the near term and to accelerate the delivery of product innovations across different market segments in the long term. The alignment of our global sales and new product development functions will also help to deliver consistent and superior client services that meet local market needs. 51 Table of Contents New product development is a critical business priority for Visa. It enables us to maintain our industry leader position by capitalizing on the payment industrys growth opportunities and to execute our business strategy in the long term. More broadly, new product development encourages economic growth and enhances the trust and integrity of electronic payments. The following business initiatives expand the scope of payment solutions to benefit existing customers and position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Although the short term volume expected from these initiatives is relatively small in comparison to total Visa volume today, we believe they are the foundation which will fuel incremental volume on our payments network in the long term. Prepaid. By offering consumers an option to pay ahead, we are able to reach new demographics, particularly the unbanked or underbanked consumers in the United States and globally. Prepaid products allow us to expand our business relationships with new clients such as those in the government and healthcare sectors, while increasing our brand presence across different market segments. We continue to identify opportunities to deliver prepaid products to meet the needs of specific local and regional markets. Mobile and eCommerce. As the internet and mobile phones become increasingly accessible around the world, they provide ideal platforms for us to expand our network capabilities to deliver not only payment solutions but also related information services such as cardholder account activity, targeted merchant offers, or instant ATM locator. We have launched a suite of pilot consumer and commercial programs and intend to continually invest in related technologies, either through strategic investments or other partnerships, to help enhance Visas brand position as global commerce and information sharing are increasingly conducted over internet and mobile platforms. Money Transfer. Individual and business consumers across the globe transfer money daily to conduct day to day business. Our Money Transfer product provides a secure, convenient and person to person platform to transfer money between Visa cardholders around the world. Money Transfer is a relevant product that meets current market needs particularly in countries outside the United States. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending patterns. Many of our financial institution customers are facing increased financial strain due to current turbulence in the financial and credit markets. Should financial institutions face limited access to credit, this may in turn constrain their ability to extend credit, ultimately impacting overall economic spending. Current economic conditions have also led to consolidation in the financial sector. Should the trend toward consolidation in the financial sector continue, this may have the effect of slowing our rate of revenue growth in the future, should one of our customers be acquired by a financial institution which is aligned with one of our competitors. Our rate of revenue growth may also be impacted by price compression should one of our financial institution customers absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged business. We expect that continued turbulence in overall economic conditions will moderate consumer and commercial discretionary spending, and our rate of credit payments volume growth, in the near term. However, we believe that the continued secular shift to debit payment products for non discretionary spending will buffer the near term impact to our overall payments volume growth. There is no historical combined statement of operations of Visa Inc. prior to October 1, 2007, because Visa Inc. did not have any operations prior to the reorganization. In order to provide insight into our operating results and trends affecting our business, this managements discussion and analysis of our operating results includes a comparison of the results of operations for fiscal 2008 to the pro forma results of operations for fiscal 2007, as if the reorganization had occurred on October 1, 2006. This pro forma information is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, and 52 Table of Contents presented in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141). See Note 3 The Reorganization to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition, this managements discussion and analysis includes a comparison of our operating results for fiscal 2008 to the operating results of Visa U.S.A., deemed the accounting acquirer in the reorganization, for fiscal 2007 and 2006. We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service fees and processed transactions are the basis for data processing fees. Current period service fees are generated from payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN based debit volume. Payments volume and revenues are impacted by changes in currency rates. Payments volume and revenues increased, reflecting in part the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, during fiscal 2008 compared to pro forma fiscal 2007. Payments volume increased 17%, to $2.7 trillion during fiscal 2008, with double digit growth in all product categories. Growth in the United States continues to reflect increases in non discretionary spending and growth in debit. Growth outside the U.S. reflects continued penetration into emerging markets. Payments volume does not impact the operating revenues we earn from Visa Europe. The following tables set forth product payments volumes for the periods presented: U.S.A. Rest of World(3) Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change (in billions, except percentages) Payments Volume Consumer credit $ 661 $ 624 6 % $ 802 $ 634 27 % $ 1,463 $ 1,258 16 % Consumer debit(1) 733 637 15 % 133 93 43 % 866 730 19 % Commercial and other 217 188 16 % 108 90 20 % 325 278 17 % Total Payments Volume $ 1,611 $ 1,449 11 % $ 1,043 $ 817 28 % $ 2,654 $ 2,266 17 % Cash volume 406 382 6 % 1,127 834 35 % 1,533 1,216 26 % Total Volume(2) $ 2,017 $ 1,831 10 % $ 2,170 $ 1,651 31 % $ 4,187 $ 3,482 20 % (1) Includes prepaid volume. (2) Total volume is the sum of total payments volume and cash volume. Total payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (3) Includes Bulgaria and Romania through March 31, 2007, after which time such countries became part of Visa Europe. (4) Service fee revenue in a given quarter is assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter, excluding PIN based debit volume. Therefore, service fees reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007 were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Processed transactions increased by 4.2 billion, or 13%, to 37.0 billion during fiscal 2008 compared to prior year. Growth in transactions processed in the United States accounted for the majority of growth in transactions processed. We continue to identify opportunities to expand our processing role outside of the United States through the penetration of our core products and the delivery of new and innovative products that meet the needs of regional markets. The following table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the periods presented: Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 2007ProForma % Change (in millions) Total transactions 36,956 32,720 13 % Operating income as a percentage of operating revenues, or operating margin, was 20% for fiscal 2008 compared with pro forma operating margin of (21%) in fiscal 2007. Our fiscal 2008 operating income includes a litigation provision of $1.5 billion, which contains an additional litigation provision of $1.1 billion in connection with an agreement reached with Discover Financial Services, to settle pending litigation. Since the Discover litigation is covered by the Companys Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to the Companys class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the plan. Refer to Note 23 Legal Matters and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. The increase in our operating margin during 2008 is primarily attributable to growth in operating revenues resulting from pricing changes and new fees. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volumes occur. Revenue growth attributable to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2008 was approximately 2% compared to the prior year and primarily impacts service fees and international transaction fees. Should the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar continue, this would have the opposite impact on our revenues. The Reorganization and IPO Our reorganization in October 2007 and subsequent IPO in March 2008 generated certain unique and non recurring business events and transactions. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned by its member financial institutions and entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Visa Inc. In connection with the reorganization, we issued different classes and series of shares reflecting the different rights and obligations of Visa financial institution members and Visa Europe based on the geographic region in which they are located. In March 2008, we successfully completed an IPO, selling 446.6 million shares of class A common stock to the public, which raised $19.1 billion in net proceeds. We used $13.4 billion of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem a portion of the class B and class C (series I) shares of Visas financial institution members and as a result Visa is now majority owned by the public. Pursuant to our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, we established an escrow account with $3.0 billion of the net proceeds of the IPO. Our Retrospective Responsibility Plan is a central component of the 54 Table of Contents reorganization and is designed to address potential liabilities arising from certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. Future settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable from the escrow account. Our capital structure was designed to implement a key principle of the Retrospective Responsibility Plan, which is that liability for the covered litigation would remain with the holders of our class B common stock, all of which are members or affiliates of members of Visa U.S.A. See Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The remaining net proceeds of $2.7 billion were retained and have been used, in October 2008, to fund the redemption of all of the class C (series II) shares and a portion of the class C (series III) shares held by Visa Europe. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Shares to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. The reorganization and IPO impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition currently and in future periods in a number of significant ways: Charges. We incurred charges related to severance and other termination benefits totaling $93 million during 2008. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional charges, which may be significant, into fiscal 2009. In connection with the IPO, we granted equity compensation awards to employees and non employee directors. We incurred $74 million in share based compensation cost during fiscal 2008. Visa Europe put option. We granted Visa Europe the option to cause the sale of Visa Europe to us. We will record any change in the fair market value of this option in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the value of the put option will result in fluctuations in our reported net income. The exercise of the Visa Europe put option would also result in a significant liquidity event. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time after March 25, 2009. Income taxes. As a result of completing the IPO and consequent ownership by parties other than our financial institution customers, we are no longer eligible to claim the California special deduction previously available to Visa U.S.A. and Visa International Service Association on the basis that both operated on a cooperative or mutual basis. Our tax provision was updated to reflect the loss of the special deduction during the last six months of fiscal 2008, resulting in an increase in taxes of $29 million in fiscal 2008. We are evaluating our global corporate tax structure as a newly formed global company and are considering various tax alternatives and strategies to assist in managing our effective tax rate in the future. We expect to see a gradual decline in our effective tax rate beginning in fiscal 2009. One time tax benefit. As anticipated, following our IPO, our earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 increased by $107 million as a result of a one time estimated tax benefit due to a change in our state tax apportionment methodology. 55 Table of Contents Results of Operations Operating Revenues and Expenses Operating Revenues Our operating revenues consist of gross operating revenues reduced by payments made to customers and merchants under volume and support incentive arrangements. Gross operating revenues consist of service fees, data processing fees, international transaction fees and other revenues. Our operating revenues are primarily generated from fees calculated on the payments volume of activity on Visa branded cards, which we refer to as service fees, and from the fees charged for providing transaction processing, which we refer to as data processing fees. Payments volume is reported by our customers and transactional information is accumulated by our transaction processing systems. Historically, pricing has varied among our different geographies because geographies outside the United States had operated under an association business model with distinct, autonomous strategies, boards of directors and management teams. In 2007, geographies outside the United States began the transition to a business model seeking to increase profitability and made competitive increases in their pricing structure. Further competitive pricing changes were made during fiscal 2008 and we will continue to assess opportunities for competitive adjustments that align with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. Nor do we earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service fees Service fees reflect payments by customers for their participation in card programs carrying our brands. Service fees are primarily calculated on the payments volume of products carrying the Visa brand. We rely on our customers to report payments volume to us. Service fees in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter, excluding PIN based debit volume. Therefore, service fees reported with respect to the 12 months ended September 30, 2008, were based on payments volumes reported by our customers for the 12 months ended June 30, 2008. Furthermore, pro forma service fees for the twelve months ended September 30, 2007 were based on payments volumes reported by our customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007. These actual and pro forma payments volumes also do not include cash disbursements obtained with Visa branded cards, balance transfers or convenience checks, which we refer to as cash volume. New service fees were introduced in April 2007, which apply to U.S. consumer debit, consumer credit and commercial payments volume. These fees supersede previously existing issuer programs. Data processing fees Data processing fees consist of fees charged to customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services, including processing services provided under our bilateral services agreement with Visa Europe. Data processing fees are based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. Data processing fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transaction occurs or services are rendered. 56 Table of Contents Data processing fees are primarily driven by the number, size and type of transactions processed and represent fees for processing transactions that facilitate the following services: Authorization. Fees to route authorization requests to the issuer when a merchant, through its acquirer, requests approval of a cardholders transaction. Clearing and settlement. Fees for determining and transferring transaction amounts due between acquirers and issuers. Single Message System, or SMS, switching. Fees for use of the SMS for determining and transferring transaction amounts between acquirers and issuers. Member processing. Fees for use of the debit processing service, which provides processing and support for Visa debit products and services. Processing guarantee. Fees charged for network operations and maintenance necessary for ongoing system availability. Other products and services. Fees for miscellaneous services that facilitate transaction and information management among Visa members. International transaction fees International transaction fees are assessed to customers on transactions where an issuer is domiciled in one country and a merchants acquirer is located in another country. International transaction fees are generally driven by cross border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. International transaction fees are influenced in large part by levels of travel and the extent to which Visa branded products are utilized for travel purposes. These fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues Other revenues consist primarily of optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services and fees for licensing and certification. Other revenues also include licensing and other service related fees from Visa Europe under the framework agreement entered into as part of the reorganization. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Volume and support incentives Volume and support incentives are contracts with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase card issuance and product acceptance and increase Visa branded transactions. These contracts, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide incentives based on payments volume growth or card issuance, or provide marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. We provide cash and other incentives to certain customers in exchange for their commitment to generate certain payments volume using Visa branded products for an agreed period of time. Pricing varies among our different geographies and may be modified on a customer by customer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements. In this regard, volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers. Accordingly, we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues. Certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections, resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives. Management regularly reviews volume and 57 Table of Contents support incentives and estimates of performance. Estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than managements original expectation or to reflect contract amendments. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of: personnel; network, electronic data processing (EDP) and communications; advertising, marketing and promotion; professional and consulting fees; depreciation and amortization; administrative and other; and litigation provision. Personnel Personnel expense consists of salaries, stock based compensation, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and communications Network, EDP and communications represent expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion Advertising, marketing and promotion include expenses associated with advertising and marketing programs, sponsorships, promotions and other related incentives to promote the Visa brand. In connection with certain sponsorship agreements, we have an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the terms of the agreements. Visa International Fees Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. paid fees to Visa International based on payments volumes, exclusive of PIN based debit volume, for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. These fees ceased as a result of the reorganization as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International became subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal and other professional services. Legal costs for third party services provided in connection with ongoing legal matters are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization include depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in the reorganization. Administrative and other Administrative and other primarily consist of facilities costs and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business, such as travel expenses. 58 Table of Contents Litigation provision Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS 5) management records a charge to income for an estimated loss if such loss is probable and reasonably estimable. We will continue to review the litigation accrual and, if necessary, future adjustments to the accrual will be made. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) primarily consists of interest expense, investment income, net and other non operating income. Interest expense Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost and equity method investments. Other non operating income Other non operating income relates to the change in fair value of the liability under the framework agreement with Visa Europe. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 compared to Visa Inc. Pro Forma Results for Fiscal 2007 Operating Revenues In fiscal 2008, operating revenues were $6.3 billion compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating revenues reflects an increase in payments volume, which increased 17%, as well as an increase in transactions processed, which increased by 13%. Revenue growth was also impacted by increases in the monetary value and the number of cross border transactions. Current economic conditions have led to consolidation in the financial sector. Should the trend toward consolidation in the financial sector continue, this may have the effect of slowing our rate of revenue growth in the future, should one of our customers be acquired by a financial institution which is aligned with one of our competitors. Our rate of revenue growth may also be impacted by price compression should one of our financial institution customers absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged business. We expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. 59 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our actual and pro forma operating revenues earned in the U.S., throughout the rest of the world, and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) U.S. operating revenues $ 3,664 $ 3,312 $ 352 11 % Rest of world operating revenues 2,378 1,688 690 41 % EU fee operating revenues 221 193 28 15 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 5,193 $ 1,070 21 % Operating revenues earned throughout the rest of the world for the twelve month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 represented 38% and 33% of total operating revenues, respectively. Growth in operating revenues earned throughout the rest of the world accounted for 64% of the increase in total operating revenues for the twelve month periods. The increase in operating revenues throughout the rest of the world reflects the impact of pricing modifications made on various services during the second half of fiscal 2007 as those geographies transitioned to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe that these pricing changes will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that this rate of revenue growth is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact of these pricing modifications. We expect future price increases to correlate more closely with innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. A significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United States result from cross border business and leisure travel. Revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross border travel and our customers need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. We expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross border business and leisure travel, in the near term. The following table sets forth the components of our actual and pro forma total operating revenues. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 3,061 $ 2,582 $ 479 19 % Data processing fees 2,073 1,659 414 25 % International transaction fees 1,721 1,193 528 44 % Other revenues 569 473 96 20 % Volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (714 ) (447 ) 63 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 5,193 $ 1,070 21 % 60 Table of Contents Service fees Payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume increased $388.3 billion, or 17%, to $2.7 trillion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. Growth in service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to new service fees introduced in April 2007 which superseded previously existing arrangements with issuers. The new fees increased service fee revenue by $131 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2008. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees reflects 13% growth in the number of transactions processed. We processed 37.0 billion transactions during fiscal 2008, compared to 32.8 billion in fiscal 2007. Growth in data processing fees outpaced the growth in underlying transaction volumes primarily due to new services and various pricing modifications both inside and outside the United States which collectively increased data processing fees by 7%. Certain of the data processing pricing modifications took place following the beginning of the third quarter of the prior fiscal year resulting in revenues which continued to grow at a faster rate than transactions. The pricing increases outside the United States reflect transition to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe these pricing changes will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in data processing fees is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts of these changes in pricing. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by cross border payments volume, which experienced double digit growth, reflecting more cross border transactions and the continued expansion in the use of electronic payments for travel purposes. During fiscal 2008, growth in international transaction fees outpaced the increase in cross border payments volume primarily due to modifications to pricing structures for certain international transactions in the United States in April 2008, as well as pricing increases outside the United States which took place in all geographical regions during the first half of fiscal 2007 as our businesses outside the United States transitioned to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe the pricing modifications will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in international transaction fees is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts of these changes in pricing. Growth in international transaction fees also reflects the positive impact of the weak U.S. dollar throughout most of fiscal 2008. As noted above, we expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross border business and leisure travel, in the near term. The impact of this trend on our revenues could be amplified should the current strengthening of the U.S. dollar continue. Other revenues The increase in other revenues was primarily driven by growth in fees related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform in which enrolled Visa cardholders earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Visa earns revenues from its financial service institution customers for administrative and rewards 61 Table of Contents fulfillment services performed in support of the Visa Extras platform. Visa Extras contributed to an increase in other revenue of 9%. Growth in other revenues was also impacted by increases in fines associated with our Cardholder Information Security Program for acquirers whose merchants have not yet met compliance standards. Volume and support incentives The increase in volume and support incentives in the current period was primarily attributable to unusually lower levels of contra revenue recorded in fiscal 2007. The lower volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by significant performance adjustments recorded in the prior year. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies of the acquired regions to that of the accounting acquirer; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in the prior year. Further detail of these and other factors are provided below. We recorded downward adjustments of $81 million related to U.S. based volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 compared to $15 million in fiscal 2008, resulting in a year over year increase of $66 million. As anticipated, volume and support incentives increased during fiscal 2008 due to a non recurring charge in the second fiscal quarter related to a customer agreement executed in the period, which increased volume and support incentives by $70 million. As further anticipated, the accounting impact of volume and support incentives assumed upon the restructuring of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007 increased volume and support incentives by $188 million. Additional increases in volume and support incentives reflect the impact of new contracts and higher payments volumes and number of transactions processed. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts or new contracts. The net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 (in millions) (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, net liability(1) $ (87 ) $ (274 ) Provision Current year provision (1,167 ) (805 ) Performance adjustments(2) 15 81 Contractual amendments(3) (9 ) 10 Subtotal volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (714 ) Payments 1,378 901 Ending balance at September 30, net asset (liability)(4) $ 130 $ (87 ) (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives of Visa Inc. at October 1, 2007 and October 1, 2006 on a pro forma basis, respectively. (2) Amount represents adjustments resulting from managements refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. (4) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented in the consolidated balance sheet of Visa Inc. at September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. 62 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses decreased 20% for fiscal 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. The change primarily reflects decreases in the litigation provision and professional and consulting fees. The following table sets forth the components of our actual and pro forma operating expenses. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,199 $ 1,159 $ 40 3 % Network, EDP and communications 339 308 31 10 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,016 1,075 (59 ) (5 )% Professional and consulting fees 438 552 (114 ) (21 )% Depreciation and amortization 237 228 9 4 % Administrative and other 332 334 (2 ) (1 )% Litigation provision 1,470 2,653 (1,183 ) (45 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 5,031 $ 6,309 $ (1,278 ) (20 )% Personnel The increase in personnel expense for fiscal 2008 reflects the offsetting impacts of charges incurred with the reorganization and IPO and reduction of certain pension and incentive expenses. Personnel expense increased due to the combined impacts of: (i) severance and other charges incurred during the period associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions; (ii) compensation expenses related to stock based awards granted to employees in connection with our IPO and (iii) a pension settlement charge of $27 million related to early recognition of actuarial losses related to employee attrition during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we incurred $93 million in severance and other charges related to workforce consolidation, an increase of $80 million over similar charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. In connection with our IPO in March 2008, employees were granted stock based awards and as a result, we recognized $74 million in compensation expense during fiscal 2008. Charges incurred related to workforce consolidation and equity awards were offset by reductions in pension expense of $34 million due to conversion of our defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan in fiscal 2008 and due to the absence of a special $53 million IPO incentive granted to employees in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Due to the deterioration in market conditions and the resulting impact on the fair value of our pension plan assets upon remeasurement at September 30, 2008, we expect that our pension plan expense will increase in fiscal 2009. Also, we continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional severance charges, which may be significant, in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense during fiscal 2008 reflects a 6% increase in maintenance, equipment rental and other costs related to outsourcing certain development activities to remote locations compared to the prior year. Maintenance and equipment rental costs may 63 Table of Contents continue to increase over time as we continue to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain support functions. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects an increase in fees for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. Advertising, marketing and promotion The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by the absence of certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that did not recur during fiscal 2008. The absence of these joint promotional campaigns reduced advertising, marketing and promotion expense by $104 million. This decrease was offset by higher advertising and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics coupled with increased promotional activity related to our Visa Extras reward program. Professional and consulting fees The reduction in professional fees during fiscal 2008 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in the prior year in connection with our reorganization. During the first half of fiscal 2008, consulting and legal fees incurred to support the IPO in fiscal 2008 were offset against the net proceeds from our IPO, reducing professional and consulting fees by $24 million versus the prior year comparable period. During 2007, professional fees incurred to support the reorganization were expensed. The reduction in consulting and legal fees attributable to the absence of prior year reorganization expenses was $94 million. Additionally, legal fees decreased in fiscal 2008 reflecting settlement of the American Express litigation in fiscal 2007. Litigation provision The decrease in litigation provision primarily reflects (i) the absence of a $1.9 billion provision related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, offset by (ii) an increase during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2008 of $1.1 billion to our litigation provision in connection with settlement of litigation with Discover Financial Services. Since both of these matters are covered by our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to our class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the plan. The increase also reflects additional accruals made in fiscal 2008 under the provisions of SFAS 5, related to other covered litigation. See Note 23 Legal Matters and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for fiscal 2008 compared to our other income (expense) on a pro forma basis for fiscal 2007. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 1 $ $ 1 NM Interest expense (143 ) (96 ) (47 ) 49 % Investment income, net 211 197 14 7 % Other 35 8 27 NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 104 $ 109 $ (5 ) (5 )% 64 Table of Contents Interest expense The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest accretion attributed to the American Express settlement. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest earned of approximately $70 million on both the litigation escrow, and the portion of the IPO proceeds retained to redeem the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock. See Note 4 Visa Europe and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This increase was offset by net realized losses and other than temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and a money market fund. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note 6 Investments and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We expect that the level of interest income will decrease following the redemption of shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock which took place in October 2008. Other non operating income Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects a change in the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe due to changes in the LIBOR interest rate. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is a combination of federal, state and foreign statutory rates and certain required adjustments to taxable income. The effective income tax rate increased to 40% during the year ended September 30, 2008 from the pro forma 15% during the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of the California special deduction after the IPO, the change in state tax apportionment and a one time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. Included in accrued litigation on our consolidated balance sheet on September 30, 2008 is approximately $3 billion associated with the American Express settlement, the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters is deferred until the payments are made and thus, as of September 30, 2008, we have a deferred tax asset of $857 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect managements best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Prior to our IPO, the State of California, where we are headquartered, historically did not tax a substantial portion of our reported income on the basis that we operated on a cooperative or mutual basis and therefore were eligible for a special deduction. As a result of the IPO and consequent ownership by parties other than our financial institution customers, we are no longer eligible to claim the special deduction, resulting in a tax increase. The tax increase was partially offset by a tax decrease resulting from a change in our state tax apportionment. The change in state tax apportionment resulted in a $115 million one time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. In July 2008, we settled with the California Franchise Tax Board with respect to certain audit issues from 1990 to 2003, which include the eligibility to claim certain items as special deductions, apportionment computation, and research and development credits. As a result of the settlement, 65 Table of Contents unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $46 million, of which $30 million were disallowed and will not be recognized and $16 million were received in cash as a tax refund. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 compared to Visa U.S.A. Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 The following discussion of results of operations compares Visa Inc. consolidated results for fiscal 2008, to Visa U.S.A. results for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Visa U.S.A. was deemed the accounting acquirer in the reorganization that took place on October 1, 2007, and therefore Visa U.S.A. results are considered the historical predecessor for those of Visa Inc. Operating Revenues The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 3,061 $ 1,945 $ 1,610 $ 1,116 $ 335 57 % 21 % Data processing fees 2,073 1,416 1,248 657 168 46 % 13 % International transaction fees 1,721 454 398 1,267 56 279 % 14 % Other revenues 569 280 280 289 103 % Volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (505 ) (588 ) (656 ) 83 130 % (14 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 3,590 $ 2,948 $ 2,673 $ 642 74 % 22 % Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in operating revenues during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the inclusion of $2.4 billion of operating revenues from other regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, offset by the absence of data processing and other revenues previously earned from Visa International and Visa Canada. Service fees The increase in service fees during fiscal 2008, is primarily driven by the inclusion of service fees from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $877 million, or 45%. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects U.S. payments volume growth of 11%. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees during fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the inclusion of data processing fees from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $463 million, or 33%. The increase also reflects growth in transaction volumes in the United States, which increased by 12%. Competitive pricing increases primarily related to the Interlink Network also increased data processing fees by 4%. 66 Table of Contents These increases are offset by the absence of data processing revenues previously earned from Visa International regions and Visa Canada. Upon the reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. and these fees are eliminated in consolidation. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees during fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the inclusion of international transaction fees of acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $1.1 billion, or 233%. Further increases were due to double digit growth in cross border payments volume reflecting more cross border transactions and continued expansion in the use of electronic payments for travel purposes. In addition, growth in international transaction fees reflects modifications to pricing structures for certain international transactions in April 2008. As noted above, we expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross border business and leisure travel, in the near term. Other revenues The increase in other revenues during fiscal 2008 reflects inclusion of other revenues from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $217 million, or 78%. License fees and fees for other services provided under the framework agreement with Visa Europe, which became effective at the time of the reorganization, represented an increase of $176 million. Growth in other revenues also reflects increased fees related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform in which enrolled Visa cardholders earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Visa earns revenues from its financial institution customers for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the Visa Extras platform. Growth in other revenues was also impacted by increases in fines associated with our Cardholder Information Security Program for acquirers whose merchants have not yet met compliance standards. During fiscal 2008, these increases were offset by the absence of $160 million in project revenues previously earned for services provided to Visa International regions and Visa Canada in fiscal 2007. Volume and support incentives The inclusion of volume and support incentives from the acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007 contributed to the increase in volume and support incentives by $236 million, or 47%. The remainder of the increase in volume and support incentives in the current period was primarily attributable to unusually lower levels of contra revenue recorded in fiscal 2007. The lower volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by significant performance adjustments recorded in the period. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies of the acquired regions to that of the accounting acquirer; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in the prior fiscal year. Further detail of these and other factors are provided below. We recorded downward adjustments of $81 million related to U.S. based volume and support in fiscal 2007 as compared to $15 million in fiscal 2008, resulting in a year over year increase of $66 million. 67 Table of Contents As anticipated, volume and support incentives increased during fiscal 2008 due to a non recurring charge in the second fiscal quarter related to a customer agreement executed in the period, which increased volume and support incentives by $70 million. As further anticipated, the accounting impact of volume and support incentives assumed upon the restructuring of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007 increased volume and support incentives by $188 million. Additional increases in volume and support incentives reflect the impact of new contracts and higher payments volumes and number of transactions processed. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts or new contracts. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 The increase in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily reflects a 9% increase in payments volume (exclusive of PIN based debit volume), and an 11% increase in transactions. Growth in operating revenues exceeded growth in payments and transactions volumes primarily due to newly introduced service fees. While we believe that these changes in fee structure will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts in fiscal 2007 of the new service fees. Service fees Payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume increased $105 billion, or 9%, to $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2007. Service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to the April 2007 introduction of new service fees. The increase in service fees from these new fees was offset by the corresponding elimination of previously existing issuer fees used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives. The net impact of the new service fees and the elimination of the existing issuer fees resulted in an increase to service fees of $190 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in the number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees increased 13%, broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed. Incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from Visa U.S.A.s debit processing services related to non Visa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volume based discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers. Of the total data processing fees, $122 million, or 9%, was collectively earned from Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by cross border payments volume, which increased by 15%, during fiscal 2007, compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multi currency payments volume, reflecting more cross border transactions as overall global travel has increased. 68 Table of Contents Volume and support incentives The decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during managements regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period. Performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of $73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $36 million in fiscal 2006. As the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year, estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. Fiscal Year ended September 30, $ Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 Visa U.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,199 $ 721 $ 671 $ 478 $ 50 66 % 7 % Network, EDP and communications 339 249 213 90 36 36 % 17 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,016 581 474 435 107 75 % 23 % Visa International fees 173 159 (173 ) 14 NM 9 % Professional and consulting fees 438 334 291 104 43 31 % 15 % Depreciation and amortization 237 126 138 111 (12 ) 88 % (9 )% Administrative and other 332 202 249 130 (47 ) 64 % (19 )% Litigation provision 1,470 2,653 23 (1,183 ) 2,630 (45 )% NM Total Operating Expenses $ 5,031 $ 5,039 $ 2,218 $ (8 ) $ 2,821 % 127 % Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Operating expenses remained flat during fiscal 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. The increase in our operating expenses due to inclusion of operating expenses attributed to the acquired regions of $1.3 billion was substantially offset by a decrease in litigation provision of $1.2 billion. Personnel The increase in personnel expense during fiscal 2008 over the prior year comparable period was primarily due to: $376 million in personnel expense attributed to the acquired regions; $93 million in severance charges related to workforce consolidation due to the elimination of overlapping functions directly connected to the reorganization; and $74 million in stock based compensation expense reflecting stock based incentives awarded to our employees in connection with our IPO. These increases were offset by reductions in personnel and other incentive expense primarily due to changes in our defined benefit pension plan since the prior year comparable period and the absence of a special IPO incentive incurred during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 69 Table of Contents Due to the deterioration in market conditions and the resulting impact on the fair value of our pension plan assets upon remeasurement at September 30, 2008, we expect that our pension plan expense will increase in fiscal 2009. Also, we continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional severance charges, which may be significant, in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense during fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $71 million attributed to the acquired regions. The remainder of the increase reflects higher software maintenance and hardware rental expense following the outsourcing of certain development functions during fiscal 2007. Maintenance and equipment rental costs may continue to increase over time as we continue to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain support functions. Advertising, marketing and promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion during fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $486 million in advertising, marketing and promotion expense attributed to the acquired regions and higher advertising and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics coupled with increased promotional activity related to our Visa Extras reward program. These increases were offset by the absence of $67 million of costs incurred during fiscal 2007 to support certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers which did not recur during fiscal 2008. Visa International fees Visa International fees ceased as a result of the reorganization, as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International both became direct subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees The increase in professional and consulting fees primarily reflects increases of $72 million attributed to the acquired regions during fiscal 2008. Depreciation and amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects increases of $118 million attributed to the acquired regions during fiscal 2008. Software amortization expense would be expected to increase over time as we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our networks as well as to developing new payment products. Administrative and other The increase in administrative and other expense during fiscal 2008, primarily reflects increases of $177 million, attributed to the acquired regions, offset by the absence of $63 million in facilities expense paid to the real estate joint ventures owned by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, which were consolidated as part of Visa Inc. following the reorganization. Litigation provision The decrease in litigation provision primarily reflects (i) the absence of a $1.9 billion provision related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, offset by (ii) an increase during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2008 of $1.1 billion to our 70 Table of Contents litigation provision in connection with settlement of litigation with Discover Financial Services. Since both of these matters are covered by the Companys Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to the Companys class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the Plan. The increase also reflects additional accruals made in fiscal 2008 under the provisions of SFAS 5, related to the covered litigation. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Total operating expenses increased by 127% to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase primarily reflects the $2.7 billion litigation provision recorded during the year, which represented 94% of that increase. Excluding the litigation provision, operating expenses increased $191 million, or 9%. Personnel Personnel expense increased 4% in fiscal 2007 due to a $26 million charge representing the first installment of a one time special bonus program of $51 million associated with the establishment of Visa Inc. Half of the $51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007. The other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of the initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met. The remaining increase of 3% reflects severance expense for certain executives, annual salary adjustments, which were broadly in line with economic price increases, offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $29 million increase in fees paid for debit processing services for charges related to processing transactions through non Visa networks; and a $12 million increase in maintenance and equipment rental costs. Fees for data processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks would be expected to grow over time as the worldwide migration from paper based to electronic payments continues. Advertising, marketing and promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $67 million increase in expenditures for certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers; and a $23 million increase in expenditures associated with Visa Extras, Visa U.S.A.s point based rewards program that enables enrolled cardholders to earn reward points on qualifying purchases. Visa International fees Although Visa U.S.A.s percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature U.S. economy, fees paid to Visa International increased due to a one time fee waiver of $13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007. 71 Table of Contents Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: a $23 million increase in contractors and outsourcing expense in connection with the outsourcing of certain data processing and development functions over the course of fiscal 2007, and additional contractors in connection with the support of other development and maintenance projects; and a $19 million increase in legal fees incurred to support ongoing litigation matters. Depreciation and amortization The decrease in depreciation and amortization during fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the absence of a $13 million impairment charge for the net carrying value of an intangible asset associated with the patent and rights to market and distribute Mini Cards in the United States incurred during fiscal 2006. Administrative and other Administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006: a $24 million charge to reimburse customers for production and issuance costs related to discontinued use of Visa branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design; and an $11 million charge to reflect expenses for business objectives related to a litigation settlement in fiscal 2006. The settlement required Visa U.S.A. to either meet certain joint business objectives or make cash payments in lieu of the business objectives over five years. Because Visa U.S.A. expects to make these related cash payments without receiving future benefits, Visa U.S.A. charged the present value of the total payments to its consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2006. Litigation provision Litigation provision increased $2.6 billion reflecting a $1.9 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express. Future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted at 4.72% over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision. The litigation provision also reflects managements liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS 5 related to the Discover litigation. The American Express and Discover litigations are covered by our Retrospective Responsibility Plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account, in accordance with our Retrospective Responsibility Plan. The remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters. 72 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 1 $ 40 $ 13 $ (39 ) $ 27 (98 )% 208 % Interest expense (143 ) (81 ) (89 ) (62 ) 8 77 % (9 )% Investment income, net 211 103 68 108 35 105 % 51 % Other 35 35 NM NA Total Other Income (Expense) $ 104 $ 62 $ (8 ) $ 42 $ 70 68 % NM Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates The decrease in other non operating income is primarily due to the absence of equity in earnings of Visa International which was acquired in the reorganization. Interest expense The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest accretion attributed to the American Express settlement. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net primarily reflects income attributed to the acquired regions, as well as interest income on a portion of the IPO proceeds to be used for redemption of the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock and interest income on the litigation escrow account. See Note 4 Visa Europe and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This increase was offset by realized losses and other than temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and a money market fund. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note 6 Investments and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We expect that the level of interest income will decrease following the redemption of the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock which took place in October 2008. Other non operating income Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects a change in the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe due to changes in the LIBOR interest rate. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Other income was $62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of $8 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in other income primarily reflected an increase in Visa U.S.A.s portion of equity 73 Table of Contents earnings from Visa International as a result of an increase in net income for Visa International and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in Visa U.S.A.s investment portfolio from tax exempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher Visa International net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year. Interest expense The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the Retailers Litigation matter. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected an increase in interest income due to a shift in the Visa U.S.A.s investment strategy from tax exempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixed income investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year. Income Taxes Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Visa Inc.s effective tax rate is a combination of federal, state and foreign statutory rates and certain required adjustments to taxable income. The effective tax rate was 40% for the year ended September 30, 2008, compared to Visa U.S.A.s 23% for the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of the California special deduction after the IPO, the change in state tax apportionment, and a one time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 The effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23% represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35% for the prior year represented a tax expense. The 23% effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year. This benefit was less than what would otherwise have been realized, primarily as a result of an adjustment to a reserve related to litigation. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2007 2006 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (in millions, except percentages) (Loss) income before income taxes and minority interest $ (1,387 ) $ 722 Minority interest 5 16 U.S. federal statutory tax (485 ) 35 % 253 35 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit (11 ) 1 % (11 ) (1 )% Reserve for tax uncertainties related to litigation 180 (13 )% Non deductible expenses and other differences 2 % 15 2 % Minority interest not subject to tax (2 ) % (6 ) (1 )% Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (316 ) 23 % $ 251 35 % 74 Table of Contents Visa U.S.A.s fiscal 2007 consolidated statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of $2.7 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation. This provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the American Express litigation and managements liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of $778 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect Visa U.S.A.s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Minority Interest The decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower Inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to Visa U.S.A.s plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity Prior to our reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada each managed their own short term and long term liquidity needs. With the completion of the reorganization, we now manage our corporate finance and treasury functions on an integrated basis. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of these treasury policies are to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingent scenarios, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to ensure payment of required litigation settlement payments and to optimize income earned within acceptable risk parameters. Based on our cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Management will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 75 Table of Contents Consolidated Balance Sheet Data The following table sets forth summarized balance sheet data for Visa Inc. at September 30, 2008 and at October 1, 2007, the date of the reorganization, and a historical balance sheet data for Visa U.S.A, deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination, at September 30, 2007: September 30, 2008(Visa Inc.) October 1, 2007(Visa Inc.) September 30, 2007(Visa U.S.A.)(1) (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,979 $ 1,278 $ 275 Current portion of restricted cash litigation escrow 1,298 Short term investment securities, available for sale 355 842 747 Total current assets 11,174 4,701 2,507 Long term restricted cash litigation escrow 630 Long term investment securities, available for sale 244 743 737 Current portion of long term debt 51 84 41 Current portion of accrued litigation obligation 2,698 2,236 2,236 Total current liabilities 7,165 4,786 3,282 Long term debt 55 40 Long term portion of accrued litigation obligation 1,060 1,446 1,446 Total stockholders equity (deficit) 21,141 16,286 (501 ) Working capital 4,009 (85 ) (775 ) (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. Inc., deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2008 and historical cash flows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007(1) Fiscal 2006(1) (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 531 $ 505 $ 450 Investing activities 554 (463 ) (278 ) Financing activities 3,624 (37 ) (37 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,704 $ 5 $ 135 (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. Inc., deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Operating Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 was $531 million. This amount was lower than income provided by operations primarily due to: Use of cash of $92 million reflecting settlement transactions. The change in net settlement receivables and payables relates to timing differences, processed volume changes and 76 Table of Contents exchange rate fluctuations. Given the proximity of the 2008 fiscal year end to a weekend, we carried a higher level of multi currency transactions in our net settlement balances. This use of cash represents the net of the increases in settlement receivable and increases in settlement payable during fiscal 2008; Use of cash reflecting annual compensation benefit payments, offset by accruals for current fiscal year compensation benefits, reflected as a reduction of $115 million in accrued compensation; and Use of cash reflecting volume and support incentive payments of $1,378 million, off set by amortization on volume and support incentives of $1,161 million, for a net use of cash of $217 million. These uses of cash were offset by deferred taxes payable on income provided by operations, depreciation and amortization and other non cash items, as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Fiscal 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $55 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with Visa U.S.A.s Visa Check card program in the prior year. The increase also reflects higher non cash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits. Investing Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by investing activities was $554 million for fiscal 2008. Cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect $1,002 million of cash acquired through the reorganization and net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities of $949 million due to a shift in investments from debt securities to shorter term cash equivalents. We also purchased property, equipment and technology of $415 million primarily related to the new data center under construction on the east coast, contributed $25 million to other investments and received distributions of $22 million from other investments. In addition, in September 2008, our $953 million investment in the Primary Reserve Fund was reclassified from cash equivalents to other current assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above. In addition, investment securities purchasing activity, net of sales and maturities, was higher during fiscal 2007. Financing Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by financing activities was $3,624 million for fiscal 2008. This amount includes IPO related activities as follows: Source of cash reflecting proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock of $19.1 billion, net of issuance costs of $550 million; 77 Table of Contents Use of cash reflecting the partial redemption of class B and class C (series I) common stock of $13.4 billion; and Use of cash reflecting the payment to the litigation escrow account of $3.0 billion for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1,085 million, reflecting funding of covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account, offset by use of cash of $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Fiscal 2007 Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on Visa U.S.A.s series A senior secured notes due December 2007 and series B senior secured notes due December 2012. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt or equity. Our current cash flow strategy is to provide timely settlement payments due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers, to pay off debt (including litigation settlements), to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of the our board of directors, and to invest excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, a fixed income investment portfolio comprised primarily of highly rated debt instruments, cash flow from operating activities and access to various borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. At September 30, 2008, October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2007 our total liquid assets, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short and long term available for sale investment securities, and our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund (the fund), discussed further below, included in prepaid and other current assets at September 30, 2008, were $6.5 billion, $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities, asset backed securities, money market funds, equity securities and cost and equity method investments. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected a number of these holdings. In September 2008, the fund (as defined above) was unable to honor our request for the full redemption of our investment totaling $983 million, and the fund was subsequently placed into liquidation. The fund announced that its per share value would drop below $1.00 per share as a result 78 Table of Contents of losses in certain of its holdings in debt securities of Lehman Brothers, who on September 15, 2008 filed for bankruptcy. The fund also announced that it would liquidate its assets and distribute funds to investors on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of shares held by each investor. We understand that the fund issuer and financial markets are working on a number of alternatives in order for shareholders to recover their investment. The investment in the fund was originally recorded as a cash equivalent on our consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2008, we consider our shares in this fund to represent an equity investment for which a market price is not readily determinable. Therefore, the investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting and classified as an other current asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Upon reclassification to other current assets, we recorded the investment at fair value with the resulting loss recorded as investment income, net. We estimated the fair value of this investment by discounting the funds underlying holdings of securities based upon an estimate of risk inherent to those holdings. Using this method, we recorded a write down of approximately $30 million in our fourth fiscal quarter which was recorded in investment income, net on our consolidated statements of operations. This write down reflects a per share price of approximately $0.97 at September 30, 2008. In October 2008, an estimated share price of $0.97 for the fund was reported by the fund manager. On October 31, 2008 we received an initial distribution of $499 million, or 52%, of the total $953 million investment recorded at September 30, 2008. Based upon the funds underlying holdings of securities, it is expected that we will receive the remaining liquidation proceeds over the next 12 months. However, it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of these distributions with certainty. We expect that the balances we held in our other money market funds as of September 19, 2008 will be covered by the Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds announced by the United States Treasury on September 29, 2008. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact liquidity include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted. Recent U.S. sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies and procedures that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment instrument. A portion of the proceeds from our IPO are held in an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. See Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2008 was $1,928 million and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet ($1,298 million in current assets and $630 million in long term assets). As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. 79 Table of Contents Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain class B and class C stockholders and certain of our customers or affiliates of our customers. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There have been no borrowings under this facility. At September 30, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants with respect to this facility. U.S. commercial paper programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. At September 30, 2008, we had no obligations outstanding under this program. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Medium term note program. Visa International has established a medium term note program authorizing the issuance of a maximum of $250 million of unsecured, private placement notes. The notes may be issued with maturities from nine months to 30 years at fixed or floating interest rates. At September 30, 2008, we had notes outstanding in an aggregate amount of $40 million, which mature in August 2009 and have a fixed interest rate of 7.53%. Interest expense on the outstanding notes for fiscal 2008 was approximately $3 million. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2008, Standard and Poors and Moodys rated our long term and short term unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 80 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement requirements. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution customers with settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. During fiscal 2008, we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of $157 million, with the highest daily balance being $455 million. Litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. We have a Retrospective Responsibility Plan to address settlements and judgments arising from covered litigation. As part of the plan, we deposited $3.0 billion of our IPO proceeds into an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be paid. The amount deposited in the escrow account caused the conversion ratio of class B shares to shares of class A common stock to decline. We may be directed by the litigation committee to conduct additional sales of class A common stock in order to increase the escrow amount, in which case the conversion rate of the class B common stock will be subject to an additional dilutive adjustment to the extent of the number of additional class A common shares sold. The litigation committee was established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International and the members of the litigation committee, all of whom are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The litigation committee may recommend or refer the cash payment portion of a proposed settlement of any covered litigation to the Visa Inc. board of directors. It is our intention to take steps during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to fund our escrow account with an additional approximate $1.1 billion. Under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, our class B shareholders will bear the cost of funding the litigation escrow account via a further dilutive adjustment in the conversion ratio of their class B shares to shares of class A common stock, reducing the total number of diluted class A shares outstanding for purposes of calculating EPS. On November 14, 2008 we filed a definitive proxy with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to amend our charter to permit us to deposit operating cash directly into the litigation escrow account with a corresponding reduction in the conversion ratio applicable to our class B common shares. Funding the litigation escrow account in this manner would also effectively act as a share repurchase program in the amount of $1.1 billion. In the event that the proxy is not approved by our shareholders it is our intention to fund the litigation escrow with an additional approximate $1.1 billion through an underwritten public offering under the established terms of our Retrospective Responsibility Plan. In March 2008, we recorded an additional litigation provision of $285 million related to the covered litigation as a charge against income. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we also recorded a provision of $1.1 billion related to the Discover litigation in connection with an agreement to settle pending litigation with Discover Financial Services. The determination to record both additional provisions was based on managements present understanding of its litigation profile and the specifics of each case and takes into account the determination of the litigation committee. Together with Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, we entered into an agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007 to settle litigation, American Express Travel Related Services Co., Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al, that had been pending since 2004. The settlement ended all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, as well as the related litigation between American Express and five co defendant banks. Under the settlement 81 Table of Contents agreement, American Express will receive maximum payments of $2.25 billion, including up to $2.07 billion from us and $185 million from the five co defendant banks. An initial payment of $1.13 billion was made in March 2008, including $945 million from us and $185 million from the five co defendant banks. Beginning April 1, 2008, we are required to pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion, contingent on American Express meeting certain performance criteria. All payments related to this covered litigation settlement will be funded out of the litigation escrow account. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our retailers litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we are required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. Redemption of class B and class C common stock. In March 2008, we redeemed 154,738,487 shares of class B common stock for $6,618 million and 159,657,751 shares of class C (series I) common stock for $6,828 million. Subsequent to our fiscal year end, on October 10, 2008, we completed the redemption of 79,748,857 shares of class C (series II) common stock and 35,263,585 shares of our class C (series III) common stock held by Visa Europe for $2,646 million, less dividends and certain other adjustments. Dividends. On June 11, 2008, our board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis) resulting in a payment of $93 million on August 29, 2008. On October 14, 2008 our board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as coverted basis). We expect to pay approximately $80 million in connection with this dividend in December 2008. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Shares to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information regarding the dividend declarations. We intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors, at an annual rate equal to $0.42 per share of class A common stock (representing an ongoing quarterly rate equal to $0.105 per share). Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put call option agreement. We have granted Visa Europe a put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time after March 25, 2009. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies the 12 month forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12 month period. Upon exercise of the put option, we will be obligated, subject only to regulatory approvals and other limited conditions, to pay the purchase price within 285 days in cash or, at our option, with a combination of cash and shares of our publicly tradable common stock. The portion of the purchase price we will be able to pay in stock will initially be limited to 43.8% based upon the redemption of class C (series I) common stock and will be reduced to the extent of any further redemptions of, or exceptions made by the directors to the transfer restrictions applicable to, the class C (series I) common stock. We must pay the purchase price in cash if the settlement of the put option occurs after March 25, 2011. We will incur a substantial financial obligation if Visa Europe exercises the put option, and we may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment, which would be due 285 days after exercise. At September 30, 2008, the fair value of the put option liability was $346 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we 82 Table of Contents may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, the 12 month projected sustainable net operating income of Visa Europe, the allocation of cost synergies, the trading price of our class A common stock, and our 12 month forward price to earnings multiple, in each case, as determined at the time the put option is exercised. We are not currently able to estimate the amount of this obligation due to the nature and number of factors involved and the range of important assumptions that would be required. However, depending upon Visa Europes level of sustainable profitability and or our 12 month forward price to earnings multiple at the time of any exercise of the option, the amount of this obligation could be several billion dollars or more. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and the employees final three to five years of earnings, as well as a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents that meet minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under ERISA. Our postretirement plan is funded on a current basis. We typically fund our pension plan in September of each year. In September 2008 and 2007 we made contributions to our pension and postretirement plans of $190 million and $65 million, respectively. In fiscal 2009 we intend to fund our defined benefits pension plan and postretirement benefit plan by approximately $70 million. Capital expenditures. We are building a new data center on the east coast of the United States at a current estimated cost of $390 million, of which we expect to capitalize approximately $335 million. In fiscal 2007, we completed the purchase of a parcel of land and commenced construction, which is expected to continue through fiscal 2009. Upon completion, we will migrate our current east coast data center to this new facility. The new data center is intended to support our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. At September 30, 2008, we had incurred total costs of $264 million related to the new data center. We have remaining committed obligations of $70 million, which is expected to be paid in fiscal 2009. The remaining $56 million of uncommitted estimated costs is expected to be paid in fiscal 2009 and 2010. We will also continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure, some of which we treat as capital expenditures. Other uses of liquidity. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2008, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $106 million. Certain charges directly connected to the reorganization will affect our results of operations in future periods. These charges, which may be significant, will include charges during fiscal 2009 related to workforce consolidation due to elimination of overlapping functions. We expect to fund these activities with existing liquid assets and projected operating cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are comprised of guarantees. Visa Inc. has no off balance sheet debt, other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. 83 Table of Contents Guarantees Our financial institution customers are responsible for settlement of transactions with other customers. However, under the bylaws of Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, and through separate membership agreements with the individual financial institution customers, these entities indemnify issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with their operating regulations. This indemnification is unlimited and is the result of the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. To manage the settlement risk under this indemnification and the resulting risk to all financial institution customers, a formalized set of credit standards is used to review financial institution customers. To reduce potential losses related to settlement risk, Visa Inc. requires certain financial institution customers to post collateral that may include cash equivalents, securities, letters of credit or guarantees in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations. Our estimated settlement exposure, after consideration of customer collateral obtained, amounted to approximately $34.8 billion at September 30, 2008. The exposure to settlement losses not covered by customer collateral is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 13 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee was under $1 million at September 30, 2008. In October 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. On July 1, 2004, upon the incorporation of the EU region as VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, the entire lease was assigned to VESI with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by United Kingdom property law under the existing lease. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make lease payments. The base rent commitment is &pound;8 million each year or $14 million in U.S. dollars (based on the September 30, 2008 exchange rate). VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Since the inception of this arrangement, Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee. The estimated fair value of this guarantee was under $1 million at September 30, 2008. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other customers under which we may agree to indemnify the customer for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial. 84 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2008. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances, proceeds from our IPO, and available credit facilities.

(2) Visa Inc. leases certain premises such as its data centers, certain regional offices, equipment and software under non cancelable operating leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Visa Inc. generally has non cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher payments and transaction volumes in connection with these agreements. These amounts are estimates and could change based on customer performance. (4) Visa Inc. is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from less than one year to 8 years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. (5) Represents amounts due in accordance with settlement agreements in the Retailers Litigation, American Express, Discover and other litigation settlements. (6) In October 2008, we redeemed all of the class C (series II) common stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1.1 billion (subject to reduction for dividends and other adjustments) and we redeemed 35,263,585 shares of class C (series III) common stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1.5 billion. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Shares. (7) Represents payments on medium term notes, 2002 series B senior secured notes, 1994 and 1995 series B secured notes. See Note 11 Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 85 Table of Contents Effective October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. At September 30, 2008, the liability for uncertain tax positions, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of state and foreign income taxes was $376 million. At September 30, 2008, we also accrued $5 million of interest and $1 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with our uncertain tax positions. Also see Note 11 Debt, Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Related Parties During fiscal 2008, a significant portion of our operating revenues were generated from four customers with officers who also serve on our board of directors. Operating revenues from these customers were approximately $538 million, or 9%, of our operating revenues for fiscal 2008. No customer accounted for 10% or more of Visa Inc.s total operating revenues during this period. The loss of any of these customers could adversely impact our operating revenues and operating income going forward. See Note 21 Related Parties to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. One of the Companys directors, and the spouse of another of the Companys directors, are also officers of entities that participated in (or are affiliated with an entity that participated in) our IPO as underwriters, and one of those entities is also one of our customers. As underwriters, each was offered and purchased 113 million shares of class A common stock at a price of $42.77 per share, a discount of $1.23 per share based on the IPO price of $44.00 per share. This price per share is the same as that paid by all underwriters in the IPO. Also as underwriters, each received total underwriter fees from us of $139 million in March 2008. We are also a party to numerous agreements with Visa Europe, a holder of our class C common stock, which allow each entity to provide services to the other at negotiated fees, including the allocation of costs for office premises which are shared by us and Visa Europe. For fiscal 2008, total operating revenues and operating expenses related to Visa Europe totaled $221 million and $7 million, respectively. At September 30, 2008, Visa Europe owed us approximately $3 million in net accounts receivable. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Also see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence included elsewhere in this report. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and is included elsewhere in this report. We have established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. 86 Table of Contents We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Revenue Recognition Volume and Support Incentives We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are fixed payments and are deferred and amortized over the period of benefit. Volume and support incentives require significant management estimates. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our customers. If our customers actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2008 performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were approximately 0.2% of our operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option We have granted Visa Europe a put option under which Visa Inc. is required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time after March 25, 2009. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies the 12 month forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12 month period. We determined the fair value of the put option using probability weighted models designed to estimate our liability The determination of the fair value of the put option requires significant estimates and assumptions. The most significant of these estimates are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the 12 month forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise of 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of one in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. 87 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions assuming various possible exercise decisions that Visa Europe could make, including the possibility it will never exercise its option, under different economic conditions in the future. Using this approach, the estimated fair value is approximately $346 million at September 30, 2008 and is included in other liabilities on the Visa Inc. consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2008. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option was exercised, which would likely be significantly in excess of this amount. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangibles The purchase method of accounting for business combinations and associated impairment assessment requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We are required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment subsequently. Valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets require the use of managements judgment. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management. We believe that the assumptions made in this regard are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets was $21.1 billion, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets at September 30, 2008. 88 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions considerable management judgment and is based on the evaluation of a number of factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic factors. We determined that our brand and customer relationships intangible assets have indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Impairment testing for goodwill requires us to assign assets and liabilities to reporting units along with estimating future cash flows for those reporting units based on assumptions of future events. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). We record a liability for claims and legal proceedings when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 89 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. In determining our liability under SFAS 5 for covered litigation under the Retrospective Responsibility Plan, we also evaluate the actions taken by the litigation committee including its decisions regarding the establishment and funding of the escrow account. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The adoption of FASB interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 required us to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits of $317 million and $857 million, respectively, associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the recognition of a liability under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. 90 Table of Contents Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP No. FAS 157 2), Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP FAS 157 2), which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have evaluated the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on our financial assets and liabilities and do not believe that the standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption on October 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements of adopting FSP FAS 157 2 on our non financial assets and liabilities. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to SFAS 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis under a fair value option. In addition, SFAS 159 includes an amendment of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2007. Effective October 1, 2008, we elected the fair value option for certain investment securities which are held in connection with employee compensation plans. These securities will be reported as trading securities with changes in fair value recorded as other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires that the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently, and that any retained noncontrolling equity investment in a deconsolidated former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. SFAS 160 also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals, and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS 141R on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 changes the 91 Table of Contents disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS 161 on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3). FSP FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting FSP FAS 142 3 on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting principles to be used in the preparation and presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. SFAS 162 will be effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1). FSP EITF 03 6 1 addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03 6 1 requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008; earlier application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting FSP EITF 03 6 1 on our results of operations and earnings per share. In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 133 1 and FIN 45 4, Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161 (FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4). FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4 is intended to improve disclosures about credit derivatives by requiring more information about the potential adverse effects of changes in credit risk on the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the sellers of credit derivatives. It amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), to require disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in hybrid instruments. The FSP also amends FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others (FIN 45), to require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a guarantee. The provisions of the FSP that amend SFAS 133 and FIN 45 are effective for reporting periods (annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. Lastly, the FSP clarifies the effective date of SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, as any reporting period (annual or quarterly interim) beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this FSP on our consolidated financial statements. 92 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from changes in market factors. We believe we are exposed to four significant market risks that could affect our business including: changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis, and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Recent U.S. sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies and procedures that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment instrument. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our business is conducted globally. Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are related primarily to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues that are derived from foreign currency denominated transactions, and to adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for costs and expenses at our non U.S. locations. These risks are managed by utilizing derivative foreign currency forward and option contracts, which we refer to as foreign currency contracts. Foreign currency contracts are primarily designated as hedges of operational cash flow exposures which result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At September 30, 2008, the currency underlying the foreign currency contracts consists of the British pound sterling. Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. did not engage in foreign currency hedges. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with customers relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. The foreign currency exchange risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. We do not consider investment securities which are classified as cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective, as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Because we have historically had the ability to hold investments until maturity, operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. 93 Table of Contents The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities at September 30, 2008 include: September 30, 2008Visa Inc. 2007Visa U.S.A.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the Visa U.S.A.s investment portfolio by approximately $7 million or $2 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $103 million and $152 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We have a credit facility to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our customers and other operational needs. This credit facility has variable rates which are applied to borrowings based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. There was no amount outstanding at September 30, 2008 under the credit facility. We have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates would have impacted the fair value of these notes by approximately $2 million at September 30, 2008. Equity Price Risk We own equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with our long term incentive and deferred compensation plans. Equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans. For these plans, employees bear the risk of market fluctuations. Realized gains and losses or other than temporary impairments experienced on these equity investments are recorded in investment income, net on our consolidated statements of operations, and are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense, respectively. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense, respectively, by $9 million and $5 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. We have a liability related to the put call option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2008. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of one in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. 94 Table of Contents Pension Plan Assets Risk Our total defined benefit pension plan assets were $624 million and $604 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Although these assets are not included in our financial statements, a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets could result in increases to our pension liability and a reduction to stockholders equity due to an increase in the underfunded status of the plan, increases in pension expense due to a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets, and increases in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2009, which we expect to make in September 2009.

ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Historical and Pro Forma Financial Condition and Results of Operations Transparency and clarity are integral to successful financial reporting and we continually strive to provide informative financial disclosures with an accurate view of our operating results and financial position. Our managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our, and the Company) on a historical and pro forma basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. Our MD&A is presented in nine sections: Overview Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations Related Parties Critical Accounting Estimates Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Visa Inc.s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview Visa operates the worlds largest retail electronic payments network and manages the worlds most recognized global financial services brand. We provide financial institutions with platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation will continue to yield significant growth opportunities. We will continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visas ability to compete, Visa consummated a reorganization in October 2007 in which Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Canada and Inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc., a Delaware stock corporation. Visa Europe remained an independent company owned by its financial institutions. To further enhance our competitive position, we successfully completed an IPO in March 2008. Further details of our reorganization and IPO are discussed below in The Reorganization and IPO. We believe that successful completion of the reorganization and IPO position us to best execute our business strategy. The global alignment of various functions and best practices subsequent to the IPO provides us the business scale to effectively deliver our existing core products across more and different geographies in the near term and to accelerate the delivery of product innovations across different market segments in the long term. The alignment of our global sales and new product development functions will also help to deliver consistent and superior client services that meet local market needs. 51 Table of Contents New product development is a critical business priority for Visa. It enables us to maintain our industry leader position by capitalizing on the payment industrys growth opportunities and to execute our business strategy in the long term. More broadly, new product development encourages economic growth and enhances the trust and integrity of electronic payments. The following business initiatives expand the scope of payment solutions to benefit existing customers and position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Although the short term volume expected from these initiatives is relatively small in comparison to total Visa volume today, we believe they are the foundation which will fuel incremental volume on our payments network in the long term. Prepaid. By offering consumers an option to pay ahead, we are able to reach new demographics, particularly the unbanked or underbanked consumers in the United States and globally. Prepaid products allow us to expand our business relationships with new clients such as those in the government and healthcare sectors, while increasing our brand presence across different market segments. We continue to identify opportunities to deliver prepaid products to meet the needs of specific local and regional markets. Mobile and eCommerce. As the internet and mobile phones become increasingly accessible around the world, they provide ideal platforms for us to expand our network capabilities to deliver not only payment solutions but also related information services such as cardholder account activity, targeted merchant offers, or instant ATM locator. We have launched a suite of pilot consumer and commercial programs and intend to continually invest in related technologies, either through strategic investments or other partnerships, to help enhance Visas brand position as global commerce and information sharing are increasingly conducted over internet and mobile platforms. Money Transfer. Individual and business consumers across the globe transfer money daily to conduct day to day business. Our Money Transfer product provides a secure, convenient and person to person platform to transfer money between Visa cardholders around the world. Money Transfer is a relevant product that meets current market needs particularly in countries outside the United States. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending patterns. Many of our financial institution customers are facing increased financial strain due to current turbulence in the financial and credit markets. Should financial institutions face limited access to credit, this may in turn constrain their ability to extend credit, ultimately impacting overall economic spending. Current economic conditions have also led to consolidation in the financial sector. Should the trend toward consolidation in the financial sector continue, this may have the effect of slowing our rate of revenue growth in the future, should one of our customers be acquired by a financial institution which is aligned with one of our competitors. Our rate of revenue growth may also be impacted by price compression should one of our financial institution customers absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged business. We expect that continued turbulence in overall economic conditions will moderate consumer and commercial discretionary spending, and our rate of credit payments volume growth, in the near term. However, we believe that the continued secular shift to debit payment products for non discretionary spending will buffer the near term impact to our overall payments volume growth. There is no historical combined statement of operations of Visa Inc. prior to October 1, 2007, because Visa Inc. did not have any operations prior to the reorganization. In order to provide insight into our operating results and trends affecting our business, this managements discussion and analysis of our operating results includes a comparison of the results of operations for fiscal 2008 to the pro forma results of operations for fiscal 2007, as if the reorganization had occurred on October 1, 2006. This pro forma information is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, and 52 Table of Contents presented in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141). See Note 3 The Reorganization to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition, this managements discussion and analysis includes a comparison of our operating results for fiscal 2008 to the operating results of Visa U.S.A., deemed the accounting acquirer in the reorganization, for fiscal 2007 and 2006. We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service fees and processed transactions are the basis for data processing fees. Current period service fees are generated from payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN based debit volume. Payments volume and revenues are impacted by changes in currency rates. Payments volume and revenues increased, reflecting in part the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, during fiscal 2008 compared to pro forma fiscal 2007. Payments volume increased 17%, to $2.7 trillion during fiscal 2008, with double digit growth in all product categories. Growth in the United States continues to reflect increases in non discretionary spending and growth in debit. Growth outside the U.S. reflects continued penetration into emerging markets. Payments volume does not impact the operating revenues we earn from Visa Europe. The following tables set forth product payments volumes for the periods presented: U.S.A. Rest of World(3) Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change (in billions, except percentages) Payments Volume Consumer credit $ 661 $ 624 6 % $ 802 $ 634 27 % $ 1,463 $ 1,258 16 % Consumer debit(1) 733 637 15 % 133 93 43 % 866 730 19 % Commercial and other 217 188 16 % 108 90 20 % 325 278 17 % Total Payments Volume $ 1,611 $ 1,449 11 % $ 1,043 $ 817 28 % $ 2,654 $ 2,266 17 % Cash volume 406 382 6 % 1,127 834 35 % 1,533 1,216 26 % Total Volume(2) $ 2,017 $ 1,831 10 % $ 2,170 $ 1,651 31 % $ 4,187 $ 3,482 20 % (1) Includes prepaid volume. (2) Total volume is the sum of total payments volume and cash volume. Total payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (3) Includes Bulgaria and Romania through March 31, 2007, after which time such countries became part of Visa Europe. (4) Service fee revenue in a given quarter is assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter, excluding PIN based debit volume. Therefore, service fees reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007 were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Processed transactions increased by 4.2 billion, or 13%, to 37.0 billion during fiscal 2008 compared to prior year. Growth in transactions processed in the United States accounted for the majority of growth in transactions processed. We continue to identify opportunities to expand our processing role outside of the United States through the penetration of our core products and the delivery of new and innovative products that meet the needs of regional markets. The following table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the periods presented: Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 2007ProForma % Change (in millions) Total transactions 36,956 32,720 13 % Operating income as a percentage of operating revenues, or operating margin, was 20% for fiscal 2008 compared with pro forma operating margin of (21%) in fiscal 2007. Our fiscal 2008 operating income includes a litigation provision of $1.5 billion, which contains an additional litigation provision of $1.1 billion in connection with an agreement reached with Discover Financial Services, to settle pending litigation. Since the Discover litigation is covered by the Companys Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to the Companys class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the plan. Refer to Note 23 Legal Matters and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. The increase in our operating margin during 2008 is primarily attributable to growth in operating revenues resulting from pricing changes and new fees. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volumes occur. Revenue growth attributable to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2008 was approximately 2% compared to the prior year and primarily impacts service fees and international transaction fees. Should the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar continue, this would have the opposite impact on our revenues. The Reorganization and IPO Our reorganization in October 2007 and subsequent IPO in March 2008 generated certain unique and non recurring business events and transactions. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned by its member financial institutions and entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Visa Inc. In connection with the reorganization, we issued different classes and series of shares reflecting the different rights and obligations of Visa financial institution members and Visa Europe based on the geographic region in which they are located. In March 2008, we successfully completed an IPO, selling 446.6 million shares of class A common stock to the public, which raised $19.1 billion in net proceeds. We used $13.4 billion of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem a portion of the class B and class C (series I) shares of Visas financial institution members and as a result Visa is now majority owned by the public. Pursuant to our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, we established an escrow account with $3.0 billion of the net proceeds of the IPO. Our Retrospective Responsibility Plan is a central component of the 54 Table of Contents reorganization and is designed to address potential liabilities arising from certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. Future settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable from the escrow account. Our capital structure was designed to implement a key principle of the Retrospective Responsibility Plan, which is that liability for the covered litigation would remain with the holders of our class B common stock, all of which are members or affiliates of members of Visa U.S.A. See Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The remaining net proceeds of $2.7 billion were retained and have been used, in October 2008, to fund the redemption of all of the class C (series II) shares and a portion of the class C (series III) shares held by Visa Europe. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Shares to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. The reorganization and IPO impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition currently and in future periods in a number of significant ways: Charges. We incurred charges related to severance and other termination benefits totaling $93 million during 2008. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional charges, which may be significant, into fiscal 2009. In connection with the IPO, we granted equity compensation awards to employees and non employee directors. We incurred $74 million in share based compensation cost during fiscal 2008. Visa Europe put option. We granted Visa Europe the option to cause the sale of Visa Europe to us. We will record any change in the fair market value of this option in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the value of the put option will result in fluctuations in our reported net income. The exercise of the Visa Europe put option would also result in a significant liquidity event. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time after March 25, 2009. Income taxes. As a result of completing the IPO and consequent ownership by parties other than our financial institution customers, we are no longer eligible to claim the California special deduction previously available to Visa U.S.A. and Visa International Service Association on the basis that both operated on a cooperative or mutual basis. Our tax provision was updated to reflect the loss of the special deduction during the last six months of fiscal 2008, resulting in an increase in taxes of $29 million in fiscal 2008. We are evaluating our global corporate tax structure as a newly formed global company and are considering various tax alternatives and strategies to assist in managing our effective tax rate in the future. We expect to see a gradual decline in our effective tax rate beginning in fiscal 2009. One time tax benefit. As anticipated, following our IPO, our earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 increased by $107 million as a result of a one time estimated tax benefit due to a change in our state tax apportionment methodology. 55 Table of Contents Results of Operations Operating Revenues and Expenses Operating Revenues Our operating revenues consist of gross operating revenues reduced by payments made to customers and merchants under volume and support incentive arrangements. Gross operating revenues consist of service fees, data processing fees, international transaction fees and other revenues. Our operating revenues are primarily generated from fees calculated on the payments volume of activity on Visa branded cards, which we refer to as service fees, and from the fees charged for providing transaction processing, which we refer to as data processing fees. Payments volume is reported by our customers and transactional information is accumulated by our transaction processing systems. Historically, pricing has varied among our different geographies because geographies outside the United States had operated under an association business model with distinct, autonomous strategies, boards of directors and management teams. In 2007, geographies outside the United States began the transition to a business model seeking to increase profitability and made competitive increases in their pricing structure. Further competitive pricing changes were made during fiscal 2008 and we will continue to assess opportunities for competitive adjustments that align with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. Nor do we earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service fees Service fees reflect payments by customers for their participation in card programs carrying our brands. Service fees are primarily calculated on the payments volume of products carrying the Visa brand. We rely on our customers to report payments volume to us. Service fees in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter, excluding PIN based debit volume. Therefore, service fees reported with respect to the 12 months ended September 30, 2008, were based on payments volumes reported by our customers for the 12 months ended June 30, 2008. Furthermore, pro forma service fees for the twelve months ended September 30, 2007 were based on payments volumes reported by our customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007. These actual and pro forma payments volumes also do not include cash disbursements obtained with Visa branded cards, balance transfers or convenience checks, which we refer to as cash volume. New service fees were introduced in April 2007, which apply to U.S. consumer debit, consumer credit and commercial payments volume. These fees supersede previously existing issuer programs. Data processing fees Data processing fees consist of fees charged to customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services, including processing services provided under our bilateral services agreement with Visa Europe. Data processing fees are based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. Data processing fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transaction occurs or services are rendered. 56 Table of Contents Data processing fees are primarily driven by the number, size and type of transactions processed and represent fees for processing transactions that facilitate the following services: Authorization. Fees to route authorization requests to the issuer when a merchant, through its acquirer, requests approval of a cardholders transaction. Clearing and settlement. Fees for determining and transferring transaction amounts due between acquirers and issuers. Single Message System, or SMS, switching. Fees for use of the SMS for determining and transferring transaction amounts between acquirers and issuers. Member processing. Fees for use of the debit processing service, which provides processing and support for Visa debit products and services. Processing guarantee. Fees charged for network operations and maintenance necessary for ongoing system availability. Other products and services. Fees for miscellaneous services that facilitate transaction and information management among Visa members. International transaction fees International transaction fees are assessed to customers on transactions where an issuer is domiciled in one country and a merchants acquirer is located in another country. International transaction fees are generally driven by cross border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. International transaction fees are influenced in large part by levels of travel and the extent to which Visa branded products are utilized for travel purposes. These fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues Other revenues consist primarily of optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services and fees for licensing and certification. Other revenues also include licensing and other service related fees from Visa Europe under the framework agreement entered into as part of the reorganization. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Volume and support incentives Volume and support incentives are contracts with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase card issuance and product acceptance and increase Visa branded transactions. These contracts, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide incentives based on payments volume growth or card issuance, or provide marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. We provide cash and other incentives to certain customers in exchange for their commitment to generate certain payments volume using Visa branded products for an agreed period of time. Pricing varies among our different geographies and may be modified on a customer by customer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements. In this regard, volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers. Accordingly, we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues. Certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections, resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives. Management regularly reviews volume and 57 Table of Contents support incentives and estimates of performance. Estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than managements original expectation or to reflect contract amendments. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of: personnel; network, electronic data processing (EDP) and communications; advertising, marketing and promotion; professional and consulting fees; depreciation and amortization; administrative and other; and litigation provision. Personnel Personnel expense consists of salaries, stock based compensation, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and communications Network, EDP and communications represent expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion Advertising, marketing and promotion include expenses associated with advertising and marketing programs, sponsorships, promotions and other related incentives to promote the Visa brand. In connection with certain sponsorship agreements, we have an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the terms of the agreements. Visa International Fees Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. paid fees to Visa International based on payments volumes, exclusive of PIN based debit volume, for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. These fees ceased as a result of the reorganization as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International became subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal and other professional services. Legal costs for third party services provided in connection with ongoing legal matters are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization include depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in the reorganization. Administrative and other Administrative and other primarily consist of facilities costs and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business, such as travel expenses. 58 Table of Contents Litigation provision Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS 5) management records a charge to income for an estimated loss if such loss is probable and reasonably estimable. We will continue to review the litigation accrual and, if necessary, future adjustments to the accrual will be made. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) primarily consists of interest expense, investment income, net and other non operating income. Interest expense Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost and equity method investments. Other non operating income Other non operating income relates to the change in fair value of the liability under the framework agreement with Visa Europe. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 compared to Visa Inc. Pro Forma Results for Fiscal 2007 Operating Revenues In fiscal 2008, operating revenues were $6.3 billion compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating revenues reflects an increase in payments volume, which increased 17%, as well as an increase in transactions processed, which increased by 13%. Revenue growth was also impacted by increases in the monetary value and the number of cross border transactions. Current economic conditions have led to consolidation in the financial sector. Should the trend toward consolidation in the financial sector continue, this may have the effect of slowing our rate of revenue growth in the future, should one of our customers be acquired by a financial institution which is aligned with one of our competitors. Our rate of revenue growth may also be impacted by price compression should one of our financial institution customers absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged business. We expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. 59 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our actual and pro forma operating revenues earned in the U.S., throughout the rest of the world, and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) U.S. operating revenues $ 3,664 $ 3,312 $ 352 11 % Rest of world operating revenues 2,378 1,688 690 41 % EU fee operating revenues 221 193 28 15 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 5,193 $ 1,070 21 % Operating revenues earned throughout the rest of the world for the twelve month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 represented 38% and 33% of total operating revenues, respectively. Growth in operating revenues earned throughout the rest of the world accounted for 64% of the increase in total operating revenues for the twelve month periods. The increase in operating revenues throughout the rest of the world reflects the impact of pricing modifications made on various services during the second half of fiscal 2007 as those geographies transitioned to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe that these pricing changes will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that this rate of revenue growth is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact of these pricing modifications. We expect future price increases to correlate more closely with innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. A significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United States result from cross border business and leisure travel. Revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross border travel and our customers need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. We expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross border business and leisure travel, in the near term. The following table sets forth the components of our actual and pro forma total operating revenues. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 3,061 $ 2,582 $ 479 19 % Data processing fees 2,073 1,659 414 25 % International transaction fees 1,721 1,193 528 44 % Other revenues 569 473 96 20 % Volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (714 ) (447 ) 63 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 5,193 $ 1,070 21 % 60 Table of Contents Service fees Payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume increased $388.3 billion, or 17%, to $2.7 trillion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. Growth in service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to new service fees introduced in April 2007 which superseded previously existing arrangements with issuers. The new fees increased service fee revenue by $131 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2008. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees reflects 13% growth in the number of transactions processed. We processed 37.0 billion transactions during fiscal 2008, compared to 32.8 billion in fiscal 2007. Growth in data processing fees outpaced the growth in underlying transaction volumes primarily due to new services and various pricing modifications both inside and outside the United States which collectively increased data processing fees by 7%. Certain of the data processing pricing modifications took place following the beginning of the third quarter of the prior fiscal year resulting in revenues which continued to grow at a faster rate than transactions. The pricing increases outside the United States reflect transition to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe these pricing changes will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in data processing fees is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts of these changes in pricing. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by cross border payments volume, which experienced double digit growth, reflecting more cross border transactions and the continued expansion in the use of electronic payments for travel purposes. During fiscal 2008, growth in international transaction fees outpaced the increase in cross border payments volume primarily due to modifications to pricing structures for certain international transactions in the United States in April 2008, as well as pricing increases outside the United States which took place in all geographical regions during the first half of fiscal 2007 as our businesses outside the United States transitioned to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe the pricing modifications will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in international transaction fees is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts of these changes in pricing. Growth in international transaction fees also reflects the positive impact of the weak U.S. dollar throughout most of fiscal 2008. As noted above, we expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross border business and leisure travel, in the near term. The impact of this trend on our revenues could be amplified should the current strengthening of the U.S. dollar continue. Other revenues The increase in other revenues was primarily driven by growth in fees related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform in which enrolled Visa cardholders earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Visa earns revenues from its financial service institution customers for administrative and rewards 61 Table of Contents fulfillment services performed in support of the Visa Extras platform. Visa Extras contributed to an increase in other revenue of 9%. Growth in other revenues was also impacted by increases in fines associated with our Cardholder Information Security Program for acquirers whose merchants have not yet met compliance standards. Volume and support incentives The increase in volume and support incentives in the current period was primarily attributable to unusually lower levels of contra revenue recorded in fiscal 2007. The lower volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by significant performance adjustments recorded in the prior year. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies of the acquired regions to that of the accounting acquirer; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in the prior year. Further detail of these and other factors are provided below. We recorded downward adjustments of $81 million related to U.S. based volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 compared to $15 million in fiscal 2008, resulting in a year over year increase of $66 million. As anticipated, volume and support incentives increased during fiscal 2008 due to a non recurring charge in the second fiscal quarter related to a customer agreement executed in the period, which increased volume and support incentives by $70 million. As further anticipated, the accounting impact of volume and support incentives assumed upon the restructuring of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007 increased volume and support incentives by $188 million. Additional increases in volume and support incentives reflect the impact of new contracts and higher payments volumes and number of transactions processed. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts or new contracts. The net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 (in millions) (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, net liability(1) $ (87 ) $ (274 ) Provision Current year provision (1,167 ) (805 ) Performance adjustments(2) 15 81 Contractual amendments(3) (9 ) 10 Subtotal volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (714 ) Payments 1,378 901 Ending balance at September 30, net asset (liability)(4) $ 130 $ (87 ) (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives of Visa Inc. at October 1, 2007 and October 1, 2006 on a pro forma basis, respectively. (2) Amount represents adjustments resulting from managements refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. (4) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented in the consolidated balance sheet of Visa Inc. at September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. 62 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses decreased 20% for fiscal 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. The change primarily reflects decreases in the litigation provision and professional and consulting fees. The following table sets forth the components of our actual and pro forma operating expenses. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,199 $ 1,159 $ 40 3 % Network, EDP and communications 339 308 31 10 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,016 1,075 (59 ) (5 )% Professional and consulting fees 438 552 (114 ) (21 )% Depreciation and amortization 237 228 9 4 % Administrative and other 332 334 (2 ) (1 )% Litigation provision 1,470 2,653 (1,183 ) (45 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 5,031 $ 6,309 $ (1,278 ) (20 )% Personnel The increase in personnel expense for fiscal 2008 reflects the offsetting impacts of charges incurred with the reorganization and IPO and reduction of certain pension and incentive expenses. Personnel expense increased due to the combined impacts of: (i) severance and other charges incurred during the period associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions; (ii) compensation expenses related to stock based awards granted to employees in connection with our IPO and (iii) a pension settlement charge of $27 million related to early recognition of actuarial losses related to employee attrition during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we incurred $93 million in severance and other charges related to workforce consolidation, an increase of $80 million over similar charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. In connection with our IPO in March 2008, employees were granted stock based awards and as a result, we recognized $74 million in compensation expense during fiscal 2008. Charges incurred related to workforce consolidation and equity awards were offset by reductions in pension expense of $34 million due to conversion of our defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan in fiscal 2008 and due to the absence of a special $53 million IPO incentive granted to employees in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Due to the deterioration in market conditions and the resulting impact on the fair value of our pension plan assets upon remeasurement at September 30, 2008, we expect that our pension plan expense will increase in fiscal 2009. Also, we continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional severance charges, which may be significant, in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense during fiscal 2008 reflects a 6% increase in maintenance, equipment rental and other costs related to outsourcing certain development activities to remote locations compared to the prior year. Maintenance and equipment rental costs may 63 Table of Contents continue to increase over time as we continue to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain support functions. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects an increase in fees for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. Advertising, marketing and promotion The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by the absence of certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that did not recur during fiscal 2008. The absence of these joint promotional campaigns reduced advertising, marketing and promotion expense by $104 million. This decrease was offset by higher advertising and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics coupled with increased promotional activity related to our Visa Extras reward program. Professional and consulting fees The reduction in professional fees during fiscal 2008 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in the prior year in connection with our reorganization. During the first half of fiscal 2008, consulting and legal fees incurred to support the IPO in fiscal 2008 were offset against the net proceeds from our IPO, reducing professional and consulting fees by $24 million versus the prior year comparable period. During 2007, professional fees incurred to support the reorganization were expensed. The reduction in consulting and legal fees attributable to the absence of prior year reorganization expenses was $94 million. Additionally, legal fees decreased in fiscal 2008 reflecting settlement of the American Express litigation in fiscal 2007. Litigation provision The decrease in litigation provision primarily reflects (i) the absence of a $1.9 billion provision related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, offset by (ii) an increase during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2008 of $1.1 billion to our litigation provision in connection with settlement of litigation with Discover Financial Services. Since both of these matters are covered by our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to our class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the plan. The increase also reflects additional accruals made in fiscal 2008 under the provisions of SFAS 5, related to other covered litigation. See Note 23 Legal Matters and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for fiscal 2008 compared to our other income (expense) on a pro forma basis for fiscal 2007. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 1 $ $ 1 NM Interest expense (143 ) (96 ) (47 ) 49 % Investment income, net 211 197 14 7 % Other 35 8 27 NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 104 $ 109 $ (5 ) (5 )% 64 Table of Contents Interest expense The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest accretion attributed to the American Express settlement. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest earned of approximately $70 million on both the litigation escrow, and the portion of the IPO proceeds retained to redeem the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock. See Note 4 Visa Europe and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This increase was offset by net realized losses and other than temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and a money market fund. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note 6 Investments and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We expect that the level of interest income will decrease following the redemption of shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock which took place in October 2008. Other non operating income Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects a change in the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe due to changes in the LIBOR interest rate. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is a combination of federal, state and foreign statutory rates and certain required adjustments to taxable income. The effective income tax rate increased to 40% during the year ended September 30, 2008 from the pro forma 15% during the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of the California special deduction after the IPO, the change in state tax apportionment and a one time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. Included in accrued litigation on our consolidated balance sheet on September 30, 2008 is approximately $3 billion associated with the American Express settlement, the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters is deferred until the payments are made and thus, as of September 30, 2008, we have a deferred tax asset of $857 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect managements best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Prior to our IPO, the State of California, where we are headquartered, historically did not tax a substantial portion of our reported income on the basis that we operated on a cooperative or mutual basis and therefore were eligible for a special deduction. As a result of the IPO and consequent ownership by parties other than our financial institution customers, we are no longer eligible to claim the special deduction, resulting in a tax increase. The tax increase was partially offset by a tax decrease resulting from a change in our state tax apportionment. The change in state tax apportionment resulted in a $115 million one time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. In July 2008, we settled with the California Franchise Tax Board with respect to certain audit issues from 1990 to 2003, which include the eligibility to claim certain items as special deductions, apportionment computation, and research and development credits. As a result of the settlement, 65 Table of Contents unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $46 million, of which $30 million were disallowed and will not be recognized and $16 million were received in cash as a tax refund. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 compared to Visa U.S.A. Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 The following discussion of results of operations compares Visa Inc. consolidated results for fiscal 2008, to Visa U.S.A. results for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Visa U.S.A. was deemed the accounting acquirer in the reorganization that took place on October 1, 2007, and therefore Visa U.S.A. results are considered the historical predecessor for those of Visa Inc. Operating Revenues The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 3,061 $ 1,945 $ 1,610 $ 1,116 $ 335 57 % 21 % Data processing fees 2,073 1,416 1,248 657 168 46 % 13 % International transaction fees 1,721 454 398 1,267 56 279 % 14 % Other revenues 569 280 280 289 103 % Volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (505 ) (588 ) (656 ) 83 130 % (14 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 3,590 $ 2,948 $ 2,673 $ 642 74 % 22 % Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in operating revenues during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the inclusion of $2.4 billion of operating revenues from other regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, offset by the absence of data processing and other revenues previously earned from Visa International and Visa Canada. Service fees The increase in service fees during fiscal 2008, is primarily driven by the inclusion of service fees from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $877 million, or 45%. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects U.S. payments volume growth of 11%. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees during fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the inclusion of data processing fees from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $463 million, or 33%. The increase also reflects growth in transaction volumes in the United States, which increased by 12%. Competitive pricing increases primarily related to the Interlink Network also increased data processing fees by 4%. 66 Table of Contents These increases are offset by the absence of data processing revenues previously earned from Visa International regions and Visa Canada. Upon the reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. and these fees are eliminated in consolidation. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees during fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the inclusion of international transaction fees of acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $1.1 billion, or 233%. Further increases were due to double digit growth in cross border payments volume reflecting more cross border transactions and continued expansion in the use of electronic payments for travel purposes. In addition, growth in international transaction fees reflects modifications to pricing structures for certain international transactions in April 2008. As noted above, we expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross border business and leisure travel, in the near term. Other revenues The increase in other revenues during fiscal 2008 reflects inclusion of other revenues from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $217 million, or 78%. License fees and fees for other services provided under the framework agreement with Visa Europe, which became effective at the time of the reorganization, represented an increase of $176 million. Growth in other revenues also reflects increased fees related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform in which enrolled Visa cardholders earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Visa earns revenues from its financial institution customers for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the Visa Extras platform. Growth in other revenues was also impacted by increases in fines associated with our Cardholder Information Security Program for acquirers whose merchants have not yet met compliance standards. During fiscal 2008, these increases were offset by the absence of $160 million in project revenues previously earned for services provided to Visa International regions and Visa Canada in fiscal 2007. Volume and support incentives The inclusion of volume and support incentives from the acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007 contributed to the increase in volume and support incentives by $236 million, or 47%. The remainder of the increase in volume and support incentives in the current period was primarily attributable to unusually lower levels of contra revenue recorded in fiscal 2007. The lower volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by significant performance adjustments recorded in the period. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies of the acquired regions to that of the accounting acquirer; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in the prior fiscal year. Further detail of these and other factors are provided below. We recorded downward adjustments of $81 million related to U.S. based volume and support in fiscal 2007 as compared to $15 million in fiscal 2008, resulting in a year over year increase of $66 million. 67 Table of Contents As anticipated, volume and support incentives increased during fiscal 2008 due to a non recurring charge in the second fiscal quarter related to a customer agreement executed in the period, which increased volume and support incentives by $70 million. As further anticipated, the accounting impact of volume and support incentives assumed upon the restructuring of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007 increased volume and support incentives by $188 million. Additional increases in volume and support incentives reflect the impact of new contracts and higher payments volumes and number of transactions processed. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts or new contracts. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 The increase in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily reflects a 9% increase in payments volume (exclusive of PIN based debit volume), and an 11% increase in transactions. Growth in operating revenues exceeded growth in payments and transactions volumes primarily due to newly introduced service fees. While we believe that these changes in fee structure will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts in fiscal 2007 of the new service fees. Service fees Payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume increased $105 billion, or 9%, to $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2007. Service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to the April 2007 introduction of new service fees. The increase in service fees from these new fees was offset by the corresponding elimination of previously existing issuer fees used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives. The net impact of the new service fees and the elimination of the existing issuer fees resulted in an increase to service fees of $190 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in the number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees increased 13%, broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed. Incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from Visa U.S.A.s debit processing services related to non Visa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volume based discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers. Of the total data processing fees, $122 million, or 9%, was collectively earned from Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by cross border payments volume, which increased by 15%, during fiscal 2007, compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multi currency payments volume, reflecting more cross border transactions as overall global travel has increased. 68 Table of Contents Volume and support incentives The decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during managements regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period. Performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of $73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $36 million in fiscal 2006. As the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year, estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. Fiscal Year ended September 30, $ Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 Visa U.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,199 $ 721 $ 671 $ 478 $ 50 66 % 7 % Network, EDP and communications 339 249 213 90 36 36 % 17 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,016 581 474 435 107 75 % 23 % Visa International fees 173 159 (173 ) 14 NM 9 % Professional and consulting fees 438 334 291 104 43 31 % 15 % Depreciation and amortization 237 126 138 111 (12 ) 88 % (9 )% Administrative and other 332 202 249 130 (47 ) 64 % (19 )% Litigation provision 1,470 2,653 23 (1,183 ) 2,630 (45 )% NM Total Operating Expenses $ 5,031 $ 5,039 $ 2,218 $ (8 ) $ 2,821 % 127 % Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Operating expenses remained flat during fiscal 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. The increase in our operating expenses due to inclusion of operating expenses attributed to the acquired regions of $1.3 billion was substantially offset by a decrease in litigation provision of $1.2 billion. Personnel The increase in personnel expense during fiscal 2008 over the prior year comparable period was primarily due to: $376 million in personnel expense attributed to the acquired regions; $93 million in severance charges related to workforce consolidation due to the elimination of overlapping functions directly connected to the reorganization; and $74 million in stock based compensation expense reflecting stock based incentives awarded to our employees in connection with our IPO. These increases were offset by reductions in personnel and other incentive expense primarily due to changes in our defined benefit pension plan since the prior year comparable period and the absence of a special IPO incentive incurred during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 69 Table of Contents Due to the deterioration in market conditions and the resulting impact on the fair value of our pension plan assets upon remeasurement at September 30, 2008, we expect that our pension plan expense will increase in fiscal 2009. Also, we continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional severance charges, which may be significant, in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense during fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $71 million attributed to the acquired regions. The remainder of the increase reflects higher software maintenance and hardware rental expense following the outsourcing of certain development functions during fiscal 2007. Maintenance and equipment rental costs may continue to increase over time as we continue to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain support functions. Advertising, marketing and promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion during fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $486 million in advertising, marketing and promotion expense attributed to the acquired regions and higher advertising and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics coupled with increased promotional activity related to our Visa Extras reward program. These increases were offset by the absence of $67 million of costs incurred during fiscal 2007 to support certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers which did not recur during fiscal 2008. Visa International fees Visa International fees ceased as a result of the reorganization, as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International both became direct subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees The increase in professional and consulting fees primarily reflects increases of $72 million attributed to the acquired regions during fiscal 2008. Depreciation and amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects increases of $118 million attributed to the acquired regions during fiscal 2008. Software amortization expense would be expected to increase over time as we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our networks as well as to developing new payment products. Administrative and other The increase in administrative and other expense during fiscal 2008, primarily reflects increases of $177 million, attributed to the acquired regions, offset by the absence of $63 million in facilities expense paid to the real estate joint ventures owned by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, which were consolidated as part of Visa Inc. following the reorganization. Litigation provision The decrease in litigation provision primarily reflects (i) the absence of a $1.9 billion provision related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, offset by (ii) an increase during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2008 of $1.1 billion to our 70 Table of Contents litigation provision in connection with settlement of litigation with Discover Financial Services. Since both of these matters are covered by the Companys Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to the Companys class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the Plan. The increase also reflects additional accruals made in fiscal 2008 under the provisions of SFAS 5, related to the covered litigation. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Total operating expenses increased by 127% to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase primarily reflects the $2.7 billion litigation provision recorded during the year, which represented 94% of that increase. Excluding the litigation provision, operating expenses increased $191 million, or 9%. Personnel Personnel expense increased 4% in fiscal 2007 due to a $26 million charge representing the first installment of a one time special bonus program of $51 million associated with the establishment of Visa Inc. Half of the $51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007. The other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of the initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met. The remaining increase of 3% reflects severance expense for certain executives, annual salary adjustments, which were broadly in line with economic price increases, offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $29 million increase in fees paid for debit processing services for charges related to processing transactions through non Visa networks; and a $12 million increase in maintenance and equipment rental costs. Fees for data processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks would be expected to grow over time as the worldwide migration from paper based to electronic payments continues. Advertising, marketing and promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: a $67 million increase in expenditures for certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers; and a $23 million increase in expenditures associated with Visa Extras, Visa U.S.A.s point based rewards program that enables enrolled cardholders to earn reward points on qualifying purchases. Visa International fees Although Visa U.S.A.s percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature U.S. economy, fees paid to Visa International increased due to a one time fee waiver of $13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007. 71 Table of Contents Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: a $23 million increase in contractors and outsourcing expense in connection with the outsourcing of certain data processing and development functions over the course of fiscal 2007, and additional contractors in connection with the support of other development and maintenance projects; and a $19 million increase in legal fees incurred to support ongoing litigation matters. Depreciation and amortization The decrease in depreciation and amortization during fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the absence of a $13 million impairment charge for the net carrying value of an intangible asset associated with the patent and rights to market and distribute Mini Cards in the United States incurred during fiscal 2006. Administrative and other Administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006: a $24 million charge to reimburse customers for production and issuance costs related to discontinued use of Visa branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design; and an $11 million charge to reflect expenses for business objectives related to a litigation settlement in fiscal 2006. The settlement required Visa U.S.A. to either meet certain joint business objectives or make cash payments in lieu of the business objectives over five years. Because Visa U.S.A. expects to make these related cash payments without receiving future benefits, Visa U.S.A. charged the present value of the total payments to its consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2006. Litigation provision Litigation provision increased $2.6 billion reflecting a $1.9 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express. Future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted at 4.72% over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision. The litigation provision also reflects managements liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS 5 related to the Discover litigation. The American Express and Discover litigations are covered by our Retrospective Responsibility Plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account, in accordance with our Retrospective Responsibility Plan. The remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters. 72 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 1 $ 40 $ 13 $ (39 ) $ 27 (98 )% 208 % Interest expense (143 ) (81 ) (89 ) (62 ) 8 77 % (9 )% Investment income, net 211 103 68 108 35 105 % 51 % Other 35 35 NM NA Total Other Income (Expense) $ 104 $ 62 $ (8 ) $ 42 $ 70 68 % NM Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates The decrease in other non operating income is primarily due to the absence of equity in earnings of Visa International which was acquired in the reorganization. Interest expense The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest accretion attributed to the American Express settlement. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net primarily reflects income attributed to the acquired regions, as well as interest income on a portion of the IPO proceeds to be used for redemption of the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock and interest income on the litigation escrow account. See Note 4 Visa Europe and Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This increase was offset by realized losses and other than temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and a money market fund. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note 6 Investments and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We expect that the level of interest income will decrease following the redemption of the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock which took place in October 2008. Other non operating income Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects a change in the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe due to changes in the LIBOR interest rate. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Other income was $62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of $8 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in other income primarily reflected an increase in Visa U.S.A.s portion of equity 73 Table of Contents earnings from Visa International as a result of an increase in net income for Visa International and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in Visa U.S.A.s investment portfolio from tax exempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher Visa International net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year. Interest expense The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the Retailers Litigation matter. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected an increase in interest income due to a shift in the Visa U.S.A.s investment strategy from tax exempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixed income investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year. Income Taxes Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Visa Inc.s effective tax rate is a combination of federal, state and foreign statutory rates and certain required adjustments to taxable income. The effective tax rate was 40% for the year ended September 30, 2008, compared to Visa U.S.A.s 23% for the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of the California special deduction after the IPO, the change in state tax apportionment, and a one time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 The effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23% represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35% for the prior year represented a tax expense. The 23% effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year. This benefit was less than what would otherwise have been realized, primarily as a result of an adjustment to a reserve related to litigation. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2007 2006 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (in millions, except percentages) (Loss) income before income taxes and minority interest $ (1,387 ) $ 722 Minority interest 5 16 U.S. federal statutory tax (485 ) 35 % 253 35 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit (11 ) 1 % (11 ) (1 )% Reserve for tax uncertainties related to litigation 180 (13 )% Non deductible expenses and other differences 2 % 15 2 % Minority interest not subject to tax (2 ) % (6 ) (1 )% Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (316 ) 23 % $ 251 35 % 74 Table of Contents Visa U.S.A.s fiscal 2007 consolidated statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of $2.7 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation. This provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the American Express litigation and managements liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of $778 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect Visa U.S.A.s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Minority Interest The decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower Inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to Visa U.S.A.s plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity Prior to our reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada each managed their own short term and long term liquidity needs. With the completion of the reorganization, we now manage our corporate finance and treasury functions on an integrated basis. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of these treasury policies are to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingent scenarios, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to ensure payment of required litigation settlement payments and to optimize income earned within acceptable risk parameters. Based on our cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Management will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 75 Table of Contents Consolidated Balance Sheet Data The following table sets forth summarized balance sheet data for Visa Inc. at September 30, 2008 and at October 1, 2007, the date of the reorganization, and a historical balance sheet data for Visa U.S.A, deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination, at September 30, 2007: September 30, 2008(Visa Inc.) October 1, 2007(Visa Inc.) September 30, 2007(Visa U.S.A.)(1) (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,979 $ 1,278 $ 275 Current portion of restricted cash litigation escrow 1,298 Short term investment securities, available for sale 355 842 747 Total current assets 11,174 4,701 2,507 Long term restricted cash litigation escrow 630 Long term investment securities, available for sale 244 743 737 Current portion of long term debt 51 84 41 Current portion of accrued litigation obligation 2,698 2,236 2,236 Total current liabilities 7,165 4,786 3,282 Long term debt 55 40 Long term portion of accrued litigation obligation 1,060 1,446 1,446 Total stockholders equity (deficit) 21,141 16,286 (501 ) Working capital 4,009 (85 ) (775 ) (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. Inc., deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2008 and historical cash flows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007(1) Fiscal 2006(1) (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 531 $ 505 $ 450 Investing activities 554 (463 ) (278 ) Financing activities 3,624 (37 ) (37 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,704 $ 5 $ 135 (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. Inc., deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Operating Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 was $531 million. This amount was lower than income provided by operations primarily due to: Use of cash of $92 million reflecting settlement transactions. The change in net settlement receivables and payables relates to timing differences, processed volume changes and 76 Table of Contents exchange rate fluctuations. Given the proximity of the 2008 fiscal year end to a weekend, we carried a higher level of multi currency transactions in our net settlement balances. This use of cash represents the net of the increases in settlement receivable and increases in settlement payable during fiscal 2008; Use of cash reflecting annual compensation benefit payments, offset by accruals for current fiscal year compensation benefits, reflected as a reduction of $115 million in accrued compensation; and Use of cash reflecting volume and support incentive payments of $1,378 million, off set by amortization on volume and support incentives of $1,161 million, for a net use of cash of $217 million. These uses of cash were offset by deferred taxes payable on income provided by operations, depreciation and amortization and other non cash items, as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Fiscal 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $55 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with Visa U.S.A.s Visa Check card program in the prior year. The increase also reflects higher non cash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits. Investing Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by investing activities was $554 million for fiscal 2008. Cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect $1,002 million of cash acquired through the reorganization and net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities of $949 million due to a shift in investments from debt securities to shorter term cash equivalents. We also purchased property, equipment and technology of $415 million primarily related to the new data center under construction on the east coast, contributed $25 million to other investments and received distributions of $22 million from other investments. In addition, in September 2008, our $953 million investment in the Primary Reserve Fund was reclassified from cash equivalents to other current assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above. In addition, investment securities purchasing activity, net of sales and maturities, was higher during fiscal 2007. Financing Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by financing activities was $3,624 million for fiscal 2008. This amount includes IPO related activities as follows: Source of cash reflecting proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock of $19.1 billion, net of issuance costs of $550 million; 77 Table of Contents Use of cash reflecting the partial redemption of class B and class C (series I) common stock of $13.4 billion; and Use of cash reflecting the payment to the litigation escrow account of $3.0 billion for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1,085 million, reflecting funding of covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account, offset by use of cash of $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Fiscal 2007 Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on Visa U.S.A.s series A senior secured notes due December 2007 and series B senior secured notes due December 2012. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt or equity. Our current cash flow strategy is to provide timely settlement payments due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers, to pay off debt (including litigation settlements), to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of the our board of directors, and to invest excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, a fixed income investment portfolio comprised primarily of highly rated debt instruments, cash flow from operating activities and access to various borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. At September 30, 2008, October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2007 our total liquid assets, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short and long term available for sale investment securities, and our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund (the fund), discussed further below, included in prepaid and other current assets at September 30, 2008, were $6.5 billion, $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities, asset backed securities, money market funds, equity securities and cost and equity method investments. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected a number of these holdings. In September 2008, the fund (as defined above) was unable to honor our request for the full redemption of our investment totaling $983 million, and the fund was subsequently placed into liquidation. The fund announced that its per share value would drop below $1.00 per share as a result 78 Table of Contents of losses in certain of its holdings in debt securities of Lehman Brothers, who on September 15, 2008 filed for bankruptcy. The fund also announced that it would liquidate its assets and distribute funds to investors on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of shares held by each investor. We understand that the fund issuer and financial markets are working on a number of alternatives in order for shareholders to recover their investment. The investment in the fund was originally recorded as a cash equivalent on our consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2008, we consider our shares in this fund to represent an equity investment for which a market price is not readily determinable. Therefore, the investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting and classified as an other current asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Upon reclassification to other current assets, we recorded the investment at fair value with the resulting loss recorded as investment income, net. We estimated the fair value of this investment by discounting the funds underlying holdings of securities based upon an estimate of risk inherent to those holdings. Using this method, we recorded a write down of approximately $30 million in our fourth fiscal quarter which was recorded in investment income, net on our consolidated statements of operations. This write down reflects a per share price of approximately $0.97 at September 30, 2008. In October 2008, an estimated share price of $0.97 for the fund was reported by the fund manager. On October 31, 2008 we received an initial distribution of $499 million, or 52%, of the total $953 million investment recorded at September 30, 2008. Based upon the funds underlying holdings of securities, it is expected that we will receive the remaining liquidation proceeds over the next 12 months. However, it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of these distributions with certainty. We expect that the balances we held in our other money market funds as of September 19, 2008 will be covered by the Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds announced by the United States Treasury on September 29, 2008. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact liquidity include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted. Recent U.S. sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies and procedures that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment instrument. A portion of the proceeds from our IPO are held in an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. See Note 5 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2008 was $1,928 million and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet ($1,298 million in current assets and $630 million in long term assets). As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. 79 Table of Contents Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain class B and class C stockholders and certain of our customers or affiliates of our customers. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There have been no borrowings under this facility. At September 30, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants with respect to this facility. U.S. commercial paper programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. At September 30, 2008, we had no obligations outstanding under this program. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Medium term note program. Visa International has established a medium term note program authorizing the issuance of a maximum of $250 million of unsecured, private placement notes. The notes may be issued with maturities from nine months to 30 years at fixed or floating interest rates. At September 30, 2008, we had notes outstanding in an aggregate amount of $40 million, which mature in August 2009 and have a fixed interest rate of 7.53%. Interest expense on the outstanding notes for fiscal 2008 was approximately $3 million. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2008, Standard and Poors and Moodys rated our long term and short term unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 80 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement requirements. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution customers with settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. During fiscal 2008, we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of $157 million, with the highest daily balance being $455 million. Litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. We have a Retrospective Responsibility Plan to address settlements and judgments arising from covered litigation. As part of the plan, we deposited $3.0 billion of our IPO proceeds into an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be paid. The amount deposited in the escrow account caused the conversion ratio of class B shares to shares of class A common stock to decline. We may be directed by the litigation committee to conduct additional sales of class A common stock in order to increase the escrow amount, in which case the conversion rate of the class B common stock will be subject to an additional dilutive adjustment to the extent of the number of additional class A common shares sold. The litigation committee was established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International and the members of the litigation committee, all of whom are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The litigation committee may recommend or refer the cash payment portion of a proposed settlement of any covered litigation to the Visa Inc. board of directors. It is our intention to take steps during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to fund our escrow account with an additional approximate $1.1 billion. Under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, our class B shareholders will bear the cost of funding the litigation escrow account via a further dilutive adjustment in the conversion ratio of their class B shares to shares of class A common stock, reducing the total number of diluted class A shares outstanding for purposes of calculating EPS. On November 14, 2008 we filed a definitive proxy with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to amend our charter to permit us to deposit operating cash directly into the litigation escrow account with a corresponding reduction in the conversion ratio applicable to our class B common shares. Funding the litigation escrow account in this manner would also effectively act as a share repurchase program in the amount of $1.1 billion. In the event that the proxy is not approved by our shareholders it is our intention to fund the litigation escrow with an additional approximate $1.1 billion through an underwritten public offering under the established terms of our Retrospective Responsibility Plan. In March 2008, we recorded an additional litigation provision of $285 million related to the covered litigation as a charge against income. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we also recorded a provision of $1.1 billion related to the Discover litigation in connection with an agreement to settle pending litigation with Discover Financial Services. The determination to record both additional provisions was based on managements present understanding of its litigation profile and the specifics of each case and takes into account the determination of the litigation committee. Together with Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, we entered into an agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007 to settle litigation, American Express Travel Related Services Co., Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al, that had been pending since 2004. The settlement ended all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, as well as the related litigation between American Express and five co defendant banks. Under the settlement 81 Table of Contents agreement, American Express will receive maximum payments of $2.25 billion, including up to $2.07 billion from us and $185 million from the five co defendant banks. An initial payment of $1.13 billion was made in March 2008, including $945 million from us and $185 million from the five co defendant banks. Beginning April 1, 2008, we are required to pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion, contingent on American Express meeting certain performance criteria. All payments related to this covered litigation settlement will be funded out of the litigation escrow account. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our retailers litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we are required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. Redemption of class B and class C common stock. In March 2008, we redeemed 154,738,487 shares of class B common stock for $6,618 million and 159,657,751 shares of class C (series I) common stock for $6,828 million. Subsequent to our fiscal year end, on October 10, 2008, we completed the redemption of 79,748,857 shares of class C (series II) common stock and 35,263,585 shares of our class C (series III) common stock held by Visa Europe for $2,646 million, less dividends and certain other adjustments. Dividends. On June 11, 2008, our board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis) resulting in a payment of $93 million on August 29, 2008. On October 14, 2008 our board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as coverted basis). We expect to pay approximately $80 million in connection with this dividend in December 2008. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Shares to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information regarding the dividend declarations. We intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors, at an annual rate equal to $0.42 per share of class A common stock (representing an ongoing quarterly rate equal to $0.105 per share). Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put call option agreement. We have granted Visa Europe a put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time after March 25, 2009. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies the 12 month forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12 month period. Upon exercise of the put option, we will be obligated, subject only to regulatory approvals and other limited conditions, to pay the purchase price within 285 days in cash or, at our option, with a combination of cash and shares of our publicly tradable common stock. The portion of the purchase price we will be able to pay in stock will initially be limited to 43.8% based upon the redemption of class C (series I) common stock and will be reduced to the extent of any further redemptions of, or exceptions made by the directors to the transfer restrictions applicable to, the class C (series I) common stock. We must pay the purchase price in cash if the settlement of the put option occurs after March 25, 2011. We will incur a substantial financial obligation if Visa Europe exercises the put option, and we may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment, which would be due 285 days after exercise. At September 30, 2008, the fair value of the put option liability was $346 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we 82 Table of Contents may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, the 12 month projected sustainable net operating income of Visa Europe, the allocation of cost synergies, the trading price of our class A common stock, and our 12 month forward price to earnings multiple, in each case, as determined at the time the put option is exercised. We are not currently able to estimate the amount of this obligation due to the nature and number of factors involved and the range of important assumptions that would be required. However, depending upon Visa Europes level of sustainable profitability and or our 12 month forward price to earnings multiple at the time of any exercise of the option, the amount of this obligation could be several billion dollars or more. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and the employees final three to five years of earnings, as well as a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents that meet minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under ERISA. Our postretirement plan is funded on a current basis. We typically fund our pension plan in September of each year. In September 2008 and 2007 we made contributions to our pension and postretirement plans of $190 million and $65 million, respectively. In fiscal 2009 we intend to fund our defined benefits pension plan and postretirement benefit plan by approximately $70 million. Capital expenditures. We are building a new data center on the east coast of the United States at a current estimated cost of $390 million, of which we expect to capitalize approximately $335 million. In fiscal 2007, we completed the purchase of a parcel of land and commenced construction, which is expected to continue through fiscal 2009. Upon completion, we will migrate our current east coast data center to this new facility. The new data center is intended to support our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. At September 30, 2008, we had incurred total costs of $264 million related to the new data center. We have remaining committed obligations of $70 million, which is expected to be paid in fiscal 2009. The remaining $56 million of uncommitted estimated costs is expected to be paid in fiscal 2009 and 2010. We will also continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure, some of which we treat as capital expenditures. Other uses of liquidity. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2008, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $106 million. Certain charges directly connected to the reorganization will affect our results of operations in future periods. These charges, which may be significant, will include charges during fiscal 2009 related to workforce consolidation due to elimination of overlapping functions. We expect to fund these activities with existing liquid assets and projected operating cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are comprised of guarantees. Visa Inc. has no off balance sheet debt, other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. 83 Table of Contents Guarantees Our financial institution customers are responsible for settlement of transactions with other customers. However, under the bylaws of Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, and through separate membership agreements with the individual financial institution customers, these entities indemnify issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with their operating regulations. This indemnification is unlimited and is the result of the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. To manage the settlement risk under this indemnification and the resulting risk to all financial institution customers, a formalized set of credit standards is used to review financial institution customers. To reduce potential losses related to settlement risk, Visa Inc. requires certain financial institution customers to post collateral that may include cash equivalents, securities, letters of credit or guarantees in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations. Our estimated settlement exposure, after consideration of customer collateral obtained, amounted to approximately $34.8 billion at September 30, 2008. The exposure to settlement losses not covered by customer collateral is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 13 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee was under $1 million at September 30, 2008. In October 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. On July 1, 2004, upon the incorporation of the EU region as VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, the entire lease was assigned to VESI with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by United Kingdom property law under the existing lease. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make lease payments. The base rent commitment is &pound;8 million each year or $14 million in U.S. dollars (based on the September 30, 2008 exchange rate). VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Since the inception of this arrangement, Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee. The estimated fair value of this guarantee was under $1 million at September 30, 2008. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other customers under which we may agree to indemnify the customer for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial. 84 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2008. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances, proceeds from our IPO, and available credit facilities.

(2) Visa Inc. leases certain premises such as its data centers, certain regional offices, equipment and software under non cancelable operating leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Visa Inc. generally has non cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher payments and transaction volumes in connection with these agreements. These amounts are estimates and could change based on customer performance. (4) Visa Inc. is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from less than one year to 8 years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. (5) Represents amounts due in accordance with settlement agreements in the Retailers Litigation, American Express, Discover and other litigation settlements. (6) In October 2008, we redeemed all of the class C (series II) common stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1.1 billion (subject to reduction for dividends and other adjustments) and we redeemed 35,263,585 shares of class C (series III) common stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1.5 billion. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Shares. (7) Represents payments on medium term notes, 2002 series B senior secured notes, 1994 and 1995 series B secured notes. See Note 11 Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 85 Table of Contents Effective October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. At September 30, 2008, the liability for uncertain tax positions, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of state and foreign income taxes was $376 million. At September 30, 2008, we also accrued $5 million of interest and $1 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with our uncertain tax positions. Also see Note 11 Debt, Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Related Parties During fiscal 2008, a significant portion of our operating revenues were generated from four customers with officers who also serve on our board of directors. Operating revenues from these customers were approximately $538 million, or 9%, of our operating revenues for fiscal 2008. No customer accounted for 10% or more of Visa Inc.s total operating revenues during this period. The loss of any of these customers could adversely impact our operating revenues and operating income going forward. See Note 21 Related Parties to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. One of the Companys directors, and the spouse of another of the Companys directors, are also officers of entities that participated in (or are affiliated with an entity that participated in) our IPO as underwriters, and one of those entities is also one of our customers. As underwriters, each was offered and purchased 113 million shares of class A common stock at a price of $42.77 per share, a discount of $1.23 per share based on the IPO price of $44.00 per share. This price per share is the same as that paid by all underwriters in the IPO. Also as underwriters, each received total underwriter fees from us of $139 million in March 2008. We are also a party to numerous agreements with Visa Europe, a holder of our class C common stock, which allow each entity to provide services to the other at negotiated fees, including the allocation of costs for office premises which are shared by us and Visa Europe. For fiscal 2008, total operating revenues and operating expenses related to Visa Europe totaled $221 million and $7 million, respectively. At September 30, 2008, Visa Europe owed us approximately $3 million in net accounts receivable. See Note 4 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Also see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence included elsewhere in this report. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and is included elsewhere in this report. We have established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. 86 Table of Contents We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Revenue Recognition Volume and Support Incentives We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are fixed payments and are deferred and amortized over the period of benefit. Volume and support incentives require significant management estimates. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our customers. If our customers actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2008 performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were approximately 0.2% of our operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option We have granted Visa Europe a put option under which Visa Inc. is required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time after March 25, 2009. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies the 12 month forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12 month period. We determined the fair value of the put option using probability weighted models designed to estimate our liability The determination of the fair value of the put option requires significant estimates and assumptions. The most significant of these estimates are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the 12 month forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise of 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of one in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. 87 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions assuming various possible exercise decisions that Visa Europe could make, including the possibility it will never exercise its option, under different economic conditions in the future. Using this approach, the estimated fair value is approximately $346 million at September 30, 2008 and is included in other liabilities on the Visa Inc. consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2008. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option was exercised, which would likely be significantly in excess of this amount. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangibles The purchase method of accounting for business combinations and associated impairment assessment requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We are required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment subsequently. Valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets require the use of managements judgment. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management. We believe that the assumptions made in this regard are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets was $21.1 billion, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets at September 30, 2008. 88 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions considerable management judgment and is based on the evaluation of a number of factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic factors. We determined that our brand and customer relationships intangible assets have indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Impairment testing for goodwill requires us to assign assets and liabilities to reporting units along with estimating future cash flows for those reporting units based on assumptions of future events. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). We record a liability for claims and legal proceedings when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 89 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. In determining our liability under SFAS 5 for covered litigation under the Retrospective Responsibility Plan, we also evaluate the actions taken by the litigation committee including its decisions regarding the establishment and funding of the escrow account. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The adoption of FASB interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 required us to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits of $317 million and $857 million, respectively, associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the recognition of a liability under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 23 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. 90 Table of Contents Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP No. FAS 157 2), Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP FAS 157 2), which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have evaluated the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on our financial assets and liabilities and do not believe that the standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption on October 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements of adopting FSP FAS 157 2 on our non financial assets and liabilities. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to SFAS 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis under a fair value option. In addition, SFAS 159 includes an amendment of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2007. Effective October 1, 2008, we elected the fair value option for certain investment securities which are held in connection with employee compensation plans. These securities will be reported as trading securities with changes in fair value recorded as other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires that the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently, and that any retained noncontrolling equity investment in a deconsolidated former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. SFAS 160 also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals, and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS 141R on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 changes the 91 Table of Contents disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS 161 on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3). FSP FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting FSP FAS 142 3 on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting principles to be used in the preparation and presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. SFAS 162 will be effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1). FSP EITF 03 6 1 addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03 6 1 requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008; earlier application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting FSP EITF 03 6 1 on our results of operations and earnings per share. In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 133 1 and FIN 45 4, Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161 (FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4). FSP 133 1 and FIN 45 4 is intended to improve disclosures about credit derivatives by requiring more information about the potential adverse effects of changes in credit risk on the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the sellers of credit derivatives. It amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), to require disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in hybrid instruments. The FSP also amends FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others (FIN 45), to require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a guarantee. The provisions of the FSP that amend SFAS 133 and FIN 45 are effective for reporting periods (annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. Lastly, the FSP clarifies the effective date of SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, as any reporting period (annual or quarterly interim) beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this FSP on our consolidated financial statements. 92 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from changes in market factors. We believe we are exposed to four significant market risks that could affect our business including: changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis, and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Recent U.S. sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies and procedures that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment instrument. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our business is conducted globally. Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are related primarily to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues that are derived from foreign currency denominated transactions, and to adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for costs and expenses at our non U.S. locations. These risks are managed by utilizing derivative foreign currency forward and option contracts, which we refer to as foreign currency contracts. Foreign currency contracts are primarily designated as hedges of operational cash flow exposures which result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At September 30, 2008, the currency underlying the foreign currency contracts consists of the British pound sterling. Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. did not engage in foreign currency hedges. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with customers relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. The foreign currency exchange risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. We do not consider investment securities which are classified as cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective, as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Because we have historically had the ability to hold investments until maturity, operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. 93 Table of Contents The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities at September 30, 2008 include: September 30, 2008Visa Inc. 2007Visa U.S.A. (in millions, exceptpercentages) U.S. government sponsored entities 391 1,274 Canadian government sponsored entities 7 Tax exempt municipal bonds 5 9 Total $ 403 $ 1,283 Percentage of total assets 1 % 29 % A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $6 million or $4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2008. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the Visa U.S.A.s investment portfolio by approximately $7 million or $2 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $103 million and $152 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We have a credit facility to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our customers and other operational needs. This credit facility has variable rates which are applied to borrowings based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. There was no amount outstanding at September 30, 2008 under the credit facility. We have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates would have impacted the fair value of these notes by approximately $2 million at September 30, 2008. Equity Price Risk We own equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with our long term incentive and deferred compensation plans. Equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans. For these plans, employees bear the risk of market fluctuations. Realized gains and losses or other than temporary impairments experienced on these equity investments are recorded in investment income, net on our consolidated statements of operations, and are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense, respectively. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense, respectively, by $9 million and $5 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. We have a liability related to the put call option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2008. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of one in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. 94 Table of Contents Pension Plan Assets Risk Our total defined benefit pension plan assets were $624 million and $604 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Although these assets are not included in our financial statements, a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets could result in increases to our pension liability and a reduction to stockholders equity due to an increase in the underfunded status of the plan, increases in pension expense due to a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets, and increases in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2009, which we expect to make in September 2009.
