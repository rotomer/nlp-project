Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations and the Visa Inc. fiscal 2009 consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of this report. Selected Financial Data Fiscal Year Ended September 30, Statement of Operations Data: 2009 2008 2007(1) 2006(1) 2005(1) (in millions, except per share data) Operating revenues $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 3,590 $ 2,948 $ 2,665 Operating expenses 3,373 5,031 5,039 2,218 2,212 Operating income (loss) 3,538 1,232 (1,449 ) 730 453 Net income (loss) 2,353 804 (1,076 ) 455 360 Basic net income per share class A common stock(2) 3.11 0.96 N/A N/A N/A Diluted net income per share class A common stock(2) 3.10 0.96 N/A N/A N/A 32 Table of Contents At September 30, Balance Sheet Data: 2009 2008 2007(1) 2006(1) 2005(1) (in millions, except per share data) Total assets $ 32,281 $ 34,981 $ 4,390 $ 2,964 $ 2,745 Current portion of long term debt(3) 12 51 41 32 32 Current portion of accrued litigation 1,394 2,698 2,236 216 197 Long term debt(3) 44 55 41 74 Long term accrued litigation 323 1,060 1,446 784 1,010 Total equity (deficit) 23,189 21,141 (501 ) 583 126 Dividend declared and paid per common share 0.42 0.105 (1) Historical balances for the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheet data prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. Inc., the accounting acquirer in the reorganization. (2) Visa U.S.A. Inc. was a non stock corporation and therefore no comparable metric for net income per share is provided for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. (3) The long term portion of Visa U.S.A. debt was classified as being due within one year at September 30, 2007 because Visa U.S.A. was in default of certain financial performance covenants as a result of the American Express settlement in fiscal 2007 as described in Note 21 Legal Matters to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visas ability to compete, we consummated a reorganization in October 2007, and in March 2008 completed our IPO. The global alignment of various functions and best practices provides us the business scale to effectively deliver our existing core products across more and different geographies and to accelerate the delivery of product innovations across different market segments. Overall Economic Conditions Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending, and our rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Regulatory measures enacted in the United States during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 expected to take effect in fiscal 2010 will impact our financial institution customers. Should financial institutions constrict credit offerings in response to these measures, this could ultimately impact consumer spending and our payments volumes. However, we believe that the continuing secular shift to electronic payment products for non discretionary spending will buffer the impact to our overall payments volume growth. This shift is particularly clear in debit products, where Visa has a strong market position in the United States and significant growth opportunities internationally. Funding of the Litigation Escrow Account During December 2008 and July 2009, we deposited $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, into the litigation escrow account (the Escrow Account) previously established under the Retrospective Responsibility Plan (the Plan). Under the terms of the Plan, when Visa funds the Escrow Account, the shares of class B common stock retained by our U.S. financial institution customers and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. On that basis, fundings of the Escrow Account in December 2008 and July 2009 had the effect of repurchasing 20,800,824 and 11,578,878 class A common stock equivalents, respectively. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Plan In October 2009 our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2010, and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. Sale of Investment in Companhia Brasileira de Meois de Pagamento (VisaNet do Brasil) In June 2009, Visa International Service Association, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company sold its 10% ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in connection with its initial public offering. As a result of this transaction, we received approximately $1 billion in net proceeds and recognized a pre tax gain of $473 million in investment income, net on our statement of operations. The amount of the gain net of tax was $237 million. Following their initial public offering, we amended an existing agreement with VisaNet do Brasil which grants a license to use Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We expect the license fees to be earned during fiscal 2010 to offset the loss of dividend income as a result of the sale of our ownership interest. Expansion of Our Processing Capabilities Expanding our processing capabilities worldwide is a core component of our long term growth strategy. As part of this strategy, we created Visa Processing Services Pte. Ltd. (VPS), a joint venture with Yalamanchili International Pte. Ltd. (Yalamanchili). We hold a 70% interest in VPS. Yalamanchili is a payments processor and software company with operations in Asia. VPS will allow us to extend our industry leading processing capabilities in geographies where electronic payments are growing rapidly, providing multi currency and multi language debit, credit and prepaid processing services to financial institutions, processors and payment companies. VPS will also have capabilities to provide ATM, money transfer and private label processing, as well as a range of payments services, including risk and fraud management, mobile applications, loyalty and cardholder support. VPS provides prepaid and debit processing solutions and complements our Debit Processing Service. Nominal Payments Volume and Transaction Counts We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. As anticipated, for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products, which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year over year nominal payments volume impact. 35 Table of Contents This table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1): U.S.A.

Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. (2) Includes prepaid volume. (3) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution customers, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter is assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. This table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the following fiscal periods: 2009 2008 % Change (in millions) Total transactions 39,885 36,956 8 % 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payment volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are earned from customers for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our customers globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. International transaction revenues are assessed to customers on transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. Other revenues consist primarily of optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services and fees for licensing and certification. Other revenues also include revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Volume and support incentives represent contracts with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are accounted for as reductions of operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, stock based compensation, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships, and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Visa International fees represents fees that Visa U.S.A. paid to Visa International prior to our reorganization for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. These fees ceased as a result of our reorganization. 37 Table of Contents Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our reorganization. Administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost and equity method investments. Other non operating income primarily relates to the change in fair value of the liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. This liability was fully discharged in October 2008. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 and Visa U.S.A. Fiscal 2007 The following discussion of results of operations compares Visa Inc. consolidated results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 and Visa U.S.A. results for fiscal 2007. Visa U.S.A. was the accounting acquirer in the reorganization that took place on October 1, 2007, and therefore Visa U.S.A. results are considered the historical predecessor for those of Visa Inc., and are included for comparison. Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the U.S., throughout the rest of the world, and from Visa Europe. Operating revenues for periods prior to October 1, 2007 are for Visa U.S.A., and are not presented in the table below, Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2009 2008 $Change %Change(1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. operating revenues $ 4,023 $ 3,664 $ 359 10 % Rest of world operating revenues 2,669 2,378 291 12 % EU fee operating revenues 219 221 (2 ) (1 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 648 10 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. 38 Table of Contents Operating revenues globally reflect the impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. U.S. revenues also reflect volume and support incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. A significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United States results from cross border business and leisure travel, which has moderated in the current economic environment. Revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross border travel and the extent to which Visa branded products are utilized for travel purposes. Our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volumes are denominated. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2009 over the prior year resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues, including the impact from our hedging activities. The decline primarily impacted service and international transaction revenues. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) Visa Inc.2009 Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,174 $ 3,061 $ 1,945 $ 113 $ 1,116 4 % 57 % Data processing revenues 2,430 2,073 1,416 357 657 17 % 46 % International transaction revenues 1,916 1,721 454 195 1,267 11 % 279 % Other revenues 625 569 280 56 289 10 % 104 % Volume and support incentives (1,234 ) (1,161 ) (505 ) (73 ) (656 ) 6 % 130 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 3,590 $ 648 $ 2,673 10 % 74 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Revenue growth in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects a moderate increase in nominal payments volume, solid growth of processed transactions and strategic pricing modifications. Operating revenues increased during fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of operating revenues from acquired regions, double digit growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross border nominal payments volume, combined with competitive pricing adjustments. The discussion below comparing fiscal 2008 and 2007 focuses on factors other than the inclusion of $2.4 billion of the acquired regions operating revenues in fiscal 2008. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of the year, combined with modest growth of 1% in nominal global payments volume. Service revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to 2007 primarily reflecting nominal U.S. payments volume growth of 11%. We expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending, and our rate of nominal payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to growth in the number of transactions processed of 8% during the year, combined with strategic pricing modifications. Data processing revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a growth of 12% in transaction volumes, coupled with competitive pricing adjustments related to the Interlink Network. We believe that the secular shift to electronic payments will continue on a global basis. 39 Table of Contents International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11% decline in cross border nominal payments volume, primarily due to competitive pricing modifications made since fiscal 2008. International transaction revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting 22% growth in cross border nominal payments volume and modifications to pricing structures for certain transactions in April 2008. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. We generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross border transaction volume, although economic downturns or other adverse international conditions would hinder this growth. Other revenues increased during fiscal 2009 and 2008 primarily due to growth in revenues related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform. The increase in other revenues during fiscal 2008 also reflects license and other service fees from Visa Europe following the reorganization, offset by the absence of project revenues previously earned for services provided to Visa International and Visa Canada in fiscal 2007. Volume and support incentives increased primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts in fiscal 2009. These incentives were partially offset by the absence of a non recurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies upon reorganization; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007. We expect volume and support incentive to increase somewhat in fiscal 2010. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or new contracts. The net asset (liability) of volume and support incentives changed during the year as follows: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, net asset (liability)(1) $ 130 $ (87 ) Provision Current year provision (1,239 ) (1,167 ) Performance adjustments(2) 41 15 Contractual adjustments(3) (36 ) (9 ) Subtotal volume and support incentives (1,234 ) (1,161 ) Payments 1,136 1,378 Ending balance at September 30, net asset(1) $ 32 $ 130 (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented in our consolidated balance sheet. (2) Amount represents downward adjustments in estimated obligations under incentive agreements resulting from managements refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. 40 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented.

Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, driven by the absence of the litigation provision in connection with our Discover settlement in fiscal 2008, coupled with lower costs in personnel, marketing and professional fees. Operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 and 2007 comparisons below focus on factors other than the inclusion of acquired regions operating expenses in fiscal 2008, which totaled $1.3 billion. This increase was substantially offset by a decrease in litigation provision of $1.2 billion. Personnel decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions, combined with reduced employee incentive related costs in fiscal 2009. Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2008 reflecting the severance charges previously discussed and stock based compensation expenses awarded to employees in connection with our IPO. Network, EDP and communications increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. In fiscal 2008, expenses increased primarily reflecting higher software maintenance and hardware rental expensed following the outsourcing of certain development functions since fiscal 2007. Advertising, marketing and promotion decreased in fiscal 2009, despite the launch of our global More people go with Visa campaign in fiscal 2009 reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost. In fiscal 2008, higher advertising, marketing and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Olympics and our Visa Extras reward program were offset by the absence of costs incurred in fiscal 2007 related to certain joint promotional campaigns which did not recur during fiscal 2008. Visa International fees ceased as a result of the reorganization, as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International both became direct subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in the prior year in connection with our global 41 Table of Contents reorganization and IPO, and related insourcing of professional services. Reduced legal fees also contributed to the decline, reflecting the settlement of outstanding litigation with Discover in fiscal 2008. Depreciation and amortization decreased during fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of depreciation and amortization for technology and facility in our Colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional depreciation of $13 million in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center. We expect our new east coast data center and office building to generate additional depreciation expense of approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010. Administrative and other remained flat in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. Administrative and other expenses in fiscal 2007 included facilities expense paid to the real estate joint ventures owned by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, which were consolidated as part of Visa Inc. following the reorganization. Litigation provision primarily reflected: (i) $1.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2008 in connection with the Discover settlement, (ii) additional accruals of $285 million made in fiscal 2008 related to covered litigation, and (iii) $1.9 billion related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express in fiscal 2007. All of these matters are covered by the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) Visa Inc.2009 Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ $ 1 $ 40 $ (1 ) $ (39 ) NM (97 )% Interest expense (115 ) (143 ) (81 ) 28 (62 ) (20 )% 77 % Investment income, net 575 211 103 364 108 NM NM Other 2 35 (33 ) 35 (95 )% NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 462 $ 104 $ 62 $ 358 $ 42 NM 67 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 reflected the equity in earnings of Visa International which was acquired in the reorganization. Interest expense decreased in 2009 reflecting lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The increase in 2008 is primarily due to interest accretion related to the American Express settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Investment income, net increased in 2009 primarily due to a pre tax gain of $473 million recognized on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, partially offset by lower interest income earned on both our investments in marketable securities and the portion of our IPO proceeds used to redeem our class C (series II) and class C (series III) common shares in October 2008. Investment income, net in fiscal 2008 also reflected realized losses and other 42 Table of Contents than temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and money market funds. See Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflected the adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. This liability was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate increased to 41% in fiscal 2009, compared with 40% in fiscal 2008 and 23% for Visa U.S.A. in fiscal 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which increased the overall effective tax rate by approximately 1%. Our Singapore subsidiary began operating under a tax incentive agreement in fiscal 2009, which had an insignificant impact on the fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of certain special deductions in California for which we were eligible prior to our IPO, the change in state tax apportionment, and a one time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 to decrease to below 40% due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payment of required litigation settlement payments, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends, to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors, to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Management will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data This table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years: 2009 2008 2007(1) (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 558 $ 531 $ 505 Investing activities 1,830 554 (463 ) Financing activities (2,751 ) 3,624 (37 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 (5 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (362 ) $ 4,704 $ 5 43 Table of Contents (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non cash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million book gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments including litigation and volume and support incentives. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income of $804 million and adjustments for non cash items of $3.1 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations, reflecting the use of $92 million to satisfy payments settlement activities; $115 million of compensation benefit payments net of new accruals; and $217 million of volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals. These uses of cash were offset by deferred taxes payable, depreciation and amortization and other non cash items, as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects $884 million of cash distribution from the Reserve Primary Fund (the Fund), net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008, reflects $1,002 million of cash acquired through the reorganization, $949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were re invested in shorter term cash equivalents and $415 million of property, equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center. In addition, we reclassified our $953 million investment in the Fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually required redemption of our class C (series II) and class C (series III) common shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.8 billion to the litigation Escrow Account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by funding of covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation Escrow Account. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributed to IPO related activities including $19.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock, offset by $13.4 billion used for the partial redemption of class B and class C (series I) common stock, and $3.0 billion payment to the litigation Escrow Account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1.1 billion, reflecting funding of covered litigation payments from the litigation Escrow Account, offset by $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long 44 Table of Contents term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Investment Portfolio. Our investment portfolio primarily comprises of securities which enable us to meet a desired level of liquidity to meet working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds, debt securities issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies and Canadian government debt securities. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Uncertainties in the credit markets have affected a number of these holdings. In September 2008, the Fund was unable to honor our request for the full redemption of our investment totaling $983 million. The Fund was subsequently placed into liquidation and announced that it would distribute funds to investors on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of shares held by each investor. Since the announcement, we have received distributions totaling $903 million, including $19 million received in October of fiscal 2010. We believe that the fund will distribute its remaining assets within twelve months, and have therefore classified our remaining investment of $69 million, which reflects an impairment of $29 million, as a current asset at September 30, 2009. See Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Revolving Credit Facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain of our class B and class C stockholders and certain of our customers and affiliates of our customers. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There have been no borrowings under this facility. At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants with respect to this facility. U.S. Commercial Paper Programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. At September 30, 2009, we had no obligations outstanding under this program. There are no financial covenants related to this program. 45 Table of Contents Universal Shelf Registration Statement. On May 6, 2009 we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. Per the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow Account. We maintain an Escrow Account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the Escrow Account the shares of class B common stock held by our shareholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2009 was $1.7 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet ($1.4 billion in current assets and $350 million in long term assets). As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2009, Standard and Poors and Moodys rated our unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including, changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments Settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. Covered Litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As part of the Plan, we deposited $3.0 billion of our IPO proceeds into an Escrow Account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be paid. During fiscal 2009, we deposited an additional $1.8 billion into the Escrow Account. Under the Plan, when the Company funds the Escrow Account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to the shares of class A common stock. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial 46 Table of Contents statements. In fiscal 2009 we made $2.0 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the Escrow Account. Other Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our retailers litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement (the Prepayment Agreement) to modify our remaining payment obligations under the original retailers litigation settlement agreement. Pursuant to the Prepayment Agreement, on October 5, 2009 we made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation. Redemption of Stock. In fiscal 2008, we redeemed 154,738,487 shares of class B common stock for $6.6 billion and 159,657,751 shares of our class C (series I) common stock for $6.8 billion. In fiscal 2009 we completed the redemption of 79,748,857 shares of our class C (series II) common stock and 35,263,585 shares of our class C (series III) common stock held by Visa Europe for $2.6 billion, less dividends and certain other adjustments. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2010 and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. Dividends. During fiscal 2009, we paid $318 million in dividends. On October 20, 2009, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.125 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $93 million in connection with this dividend in December 2009. See Note 15 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the dividend declarations. We intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors, at an annual rate equal to $0.50 per share of class A common stock. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe Put Option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple (the P/E ratio) at the time the option is exercised (as defined in the option agreement) to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12 month period (adjusted sustainable income). Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income is calculated under the terms of the put option agreement and includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the put option liability was $346 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as determined at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $75 million of adjusted 47 Table of Contents sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below for illustrative purposes only is based on Visa Europes financial results for the year ended September 30, 2008. However, this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2008 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2009, our estimated long term P/E ratio was 22.0 and the P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 4.5x as compared to the estimated long term differential of 5.3x we used to value the put option. However these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were to be exercised at any point in the future. Visa Incs Forward Price to Earnings Ratio Payout Assuming Adjusted Projected Sustainable Net Operating Income of $75 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Sustainable Net Income Above/Below $75 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $1,875 $625 20 $1,500 $500 15 $1,125 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and employees final three to five years of earnings, as well as a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and for Visa U.S.A. in fiscal 2007, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $170 million, $190 million and $65 million, respectively. In fiscal 2010, we intend to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $70 million. Capital Expenditures. During fiscal 2009, we completed the construction of a new data center on the east coast of the United States. Upon completion in March 2009, we migrated our current east coast data center to this new facility. The new data center is intended to support our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 we incurred total costs of $156 million, $241 million and $23 million, respectively related to the construction of this new data center. We will continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure, some of which we treat as capital expenditures. Other Uses. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2009, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $56 million. 48 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2009, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.3 billion of assets, of which $34 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non binding market consensus prices or the non binding broker quotes. Marketable debt instruments in this category include corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, other asset backed securities and auction rate securities. See Note 5 Investments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are comprised of guarantees. Visa has no off balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2009. We indemnify customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is unlimited. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require customers to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other customers under which we may agree to indemnify the customer for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2009. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and 49 Table of Contents available credit facilities. See Note 3 Visa Europe, Note 10 Debt, Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents non cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from less than one year to eight years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. (5) Included dividend amount of $93 million as dividends were declared on October 20, 2009 and will be paid on December 1, 2009 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 16, 2009. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $397 million, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of state and foreign income taxes. At September 30, 2009, we also accrued $22 million of interest and $5 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $346 million at September 30, 2009 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition Volume and Support Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are based on fixed payments and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are met. The deferability criteria includes the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our customers. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our customers actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2009, performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1% of our total operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option under which we are required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, as defined in the agreement, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12 month period. See Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option, which under certain conditions could obligate us to purchase its members equity interests for an amount greater than fair value, was determined to be 51 Table of Contents approximately $346 million at September 30, 2009. While the put option is in fact non transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction. Our valuation methodology involves using probability weighted models designed to estimate the present value of our liability assuming various possible exercise decisions that Visa Europe could make, including the possibility it will never exercise its option, under different economic conditions in the future. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option, and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its articles of association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over both the shorter of the preceding 24 months or since our IPO (the long term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30 day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30 day P/E calculation as compared to the long term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in long term value of the Company or the result of short term market volatility or other non Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicators, as opposed to short term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of the future earnings of Visa Inc. and the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income. 52 Table of Contents The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from euros to U.S. dollars reflects our estimate of long term exchange rates and is determined based on forward foreign exchange rates available in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. The put option became exercisable during fiscal 2009. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2009. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our brand and customer relationships intangible assets have indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to one reporting unit, which is the level in which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. Review of impairment is completed annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Impairment testing for intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or asset group and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value is less than the carrying value. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that 53 Table of Contents goodwill. Management relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. No impairment of our intangible assets or goodwill exists as of our July 1, 2009 annual assessment, and no events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization among other factors. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets was $21.1 billion, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets at September 30, 2009. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding to which we are a party. We record a liability for claims and legal proceedings when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. 54 Table of Contents Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended FASB ASC 260 10 to address whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method. The amendment requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. We will adopt this amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This change will not result in any impact to fiscal 2009 and 2008 full year diluted class A net income per share. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency rates, interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis, and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are related primarily to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues that are derived from foreign currency denominated transactions, and to adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for costs and expenses at our non U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedges exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. In fiscal 2009, we implemented a rolling hedge strategy program, which we anticipate utilizing going forward. Under this strategy, we seek to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $742 million and $4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008. The aggregate notional amount of $742 million outstanding at September 30, 2009 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of $61 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2009. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with customers relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 55 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were $176 million and $403 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $3 million at September 30, 2009. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $34 million and $103 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates would have impacted the fair value of these notes by approximately $2 million at September 30, 2009. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2009. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Assets Risk Our total defined benefit pension plan assets were $703 million and $624 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Although these assets are not included in our financial statements, a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets could result in increases to our pension liability and a reduction to stockholders equity due to an increase in the underfunded status of the plan, increases in pension expense due to a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets, and increases in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2010, which we expect to make in September 2010.

ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visas ability to compete, we consummated a reorganization in October 2007, and in March 2008 completed our IPO. The global alignment of various functions and best practices provides us the business scale to effectively deliver our existing core products across more and different geographies and to accelerate the delivery of product innovations across different market segments. Overall Economic Conditions Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending, and our rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Regulatory measures enacted in the United States during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 expected to take effect in fiscal 2010 will impact our financial institution customers. Should financial institutions constrict credit offerings in response to these measures, this could ultimately impact consumer spending and our payments volumes. However, we believe that the continuing secular shift to electronic payment products for non discretionary spending will buffer the impact to our overall payments volume growth. This shift is particularly clear in debit products, where Visa has a strong market position in the United States and significant growth opportunities internationally. Funding of the Litigation Escrow Account During December 2008 and July 2009, we deposited $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, into the litigation escrow account (the Escrow Account) previously established under the Retrospective Responsibility Plan (the Plan). Under the terms of the Plan, when Visa funds the Escrow Account, the shares of class B common stock retained by our U.S. financial institution customers and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. On that basis, fundings of the Escrow Account in December 2008 and July 2009 had the effect of repurchasing 20,800,824 and 11,578,878 class A common stock equivalents, respectively. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Plan In October 2009 our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2010, and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. Sale of Investment in Companhia Brasileira de Meois de Pagamento (VisaNet do Brasil) In June 2009, Visa International Service Association, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company sold its 10% ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in connection with its initial public offering. As a result of this transaction, we received approximately $1 billion in net proceeds and recognized a pre tax gain of $473 million in investment income, net on our statement of operations. The amount of the gain net of tax was $237 million. Following their initial public offering, we amended an existing agreement with VisaNet do Brasil which grants a license to use Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We expect the license fees to be earned during fiscal 2010 to offset the loss of dividend income as a result of the sale of our ownership interest. Expansion of Our Processing Capabilities Expanding our processing capabilities worldwide is a core component of our long term growth strategy. As part of this strategy, we created Visa Processing Services Pte. Ltd. (VPS), a joint venture with Yalamanchili International Pte. Ltd. (Yalamanchili). We hold a 70% interest in VPS. Yalamanchili is a payments processor and software company with operations in Asia. VPS will allow us to extend our industry leading processing capabilities in geographies where electronic payments are growing rapidly, providing multi currency and multi language debit, credit and prepaid processing services to financial institutions, processors and payment companies. VPS will also have capabilities to provide ATM, money transfer and private label processing, as well as a range of payments services, including risk and fraud management, mobile applications, loyalty and cardholder support. VPS provides prepaid and debit processing solutions and complements our Debit Processing Service. Nominal Payments Volume and Transaction Counts We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. As anticipated, for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products, which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year over year nominal payments volume impact. 35 Table of Contents This table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1): U.S.A.

Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. (2) Includes prepaid volume. (3) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution customers, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter is assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. This table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the following fiscal periods: 2009 2008 % Change (in millions) Total transactions 39,885 36,956 8 % 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payment volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are earned from customers for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our customers globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. International transaction revenues are assessed to customers on transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. Other revenues consist primarily of optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services and fees for licensing and certification. Other revenues also include revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Volume and support incentives represent contracts with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are accounted for as reductions of operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, stock based compensation, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships, and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Visa International fees represents fees that Visa U.S.A. paid to Visa International prior to our reorganization for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. These fees ceased as a result of our reorganization. 37 Table of Contents Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our reorganization. Administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost and equity method investments. Other non operating income primarily relates to the change in fair value of the liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. This liability was fully discharged in October 2008. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 and Visa U.S.A. Fiscal 2007 The following discussion of results of operations compares Visa Inc. consolidated results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 and Visa U.S.A. results for fiscal 2007. Visa U.S.A. was the accounting acquirer in the reorganization that took place on October 1, 2007, and therefore Visa U.S.A. results are considered the historical predecessor for those of Visa Inc., and are included for comparison. Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the U.S., throughout the rest of the world, and from Visa Europe. Operating revenues for periods prior to October 1, 2007 are for Visa U.S.A., and are not presented in the table below, Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe.

U.S. revenues also reflect volume and support incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. A significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United States results from cross border business and leisure travel, which has moderated in the current economic environment. Revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross border travel and the extent to which Visa branded products are utilized for travel purposes. Our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volumes are denominated. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2009 over the prior year resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues, including the impact from our hedging activities. The decline primarily impacted service and international transaction revenues. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) Visa Inc.2009 Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,174 $ 3,061 $ 1,945 $ 113 $ 1,116 4 % 57 % Data processing revenues 2,430 2,073 1,416 357 657 17 % 46 % International transaction revenues 1,916 1,721 454 195 1,267 11 % 279 % Other revenues 625 569 280 56 289 10 % 104 % Volume and support incentives (1,234 ) (1,161 ) (505 ) (73 ) (656 ) 6 % 130 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 3,590 $ 648 $ 2,673 10 % 74 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Revenue growth in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects a moderate increase in nominal payments volume, solid growth of processed transactions and strategic pricing modifications. Operating revenues increased during fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of operating revenues from acquired regions, double digit growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross border nominal payments volume, combined with competitive pricing adjustments. The discussion below comparing fiscal 2008 and 2007 focuses on factors other than the inclusion of $2.4 billion of the acquired regions operating revenues in fiscal 2008. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of the year, combined with modest growth of 1% in nominal global payments volume. Service revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to 2007 primarily reflecting nominal U.S. payments volume growth of 11%. We expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending, and our rate of nominal payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to growth in the number of transactions processed of 8% during the year, combined with strategic pricing modifications. Data processing revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a growth of 12% in transaction volumes, coupled with competitive pricing adjustments related to the Interlink Network. We believe that the secular shift to electronic payments will continue on a global basis. 39 Table of Contents International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11% decline in cross border nominal payments volume, primarily due to competitive pricing modifications made since fiscal 2008. International transaction revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting 22% growth in cross border nominal payments volume and modifications to pricing structures for certain transactions in April 2008. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. We generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross border transaction volume, although economic downturns or other adverse international conditions would hinder this growth. Other revenues increased during fiscal 2009 and 2008 primarily due to growth in revenues related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform. The increase in other revenues during fiscal 2008 also reflects license and other service fees from Visa Europe following the reorganization, offset by the absence of project revenues previously earned for services provided to Visa International and Visa Canada in fiscal 2007. Volume and support incentives increased primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts in fiscal 2009. These incentives were partially offset by the absence of a non recurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies upon reorganization; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007. We expect volume and support incentive to increase somewhat in fiscal 2010. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or new contracts. The net asset (liability) of volume and support incentives changed during the year as follows: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, net asset (liability)(1) $ 130 $ (87 ) Provision Current year provision (1,239 ) (1,167 ) Performance adjustments(2) 41 15 Contractual adjustments(3) (36 ) (9 ) Subtotal volume and support incentives (1,234 ) (1,161 ) Payments 1,136 1,378 Ending balance at September 30, net asset(1) $ 32 $ 130 (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented in our consolidated balance sheet. (2) Amount represents downward adjustments in estimated obligations under incentive agreements resulting from managements refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. 40 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented.

Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, driven by the absence of the litigation provision in connection with our Discover settlement in fiscal 2008, coupled with lower costs in personnel, marketing and professional fees. Operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 and 2007 comparisons below focus on factors other than the inclusion of acquired regions operating expenses in fiscal 2008, which totaled $1.3 billion. This increase was substantially offset by a decrease in litigation provision of $1.2 billion. Personnel decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions, combined with reduced employee incentive related costs in fiscal 2009. Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2008 reflecting the severance charges previously discussed and stock based compensation expenses awarded to employees in connection with our IPO. Network, EDP and communications increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. In fiscal 2008, expenses increased primarily reflecting higher software maintenance and hardware rental expensed following the outsourcing of certain development functions since fiscal 2007. Advertising, marketing and promotion decreased in fiscal 2009, despite the launch of our global More people go with Visa campaign in fiscal 2009 reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost. In fiscal 2008, higher advertising, marketing and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Olympics and our Visa Extras reward program were offset by the absence of costs incurred in fiscal 2007 related to certain joint promotional campaigns which did not recur during fiscal 2008. Visa International fees ceased as a result of the reorganization, as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International both became direct subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in the prior year in connection with our global 41 Table of Contents reorganization and IPO, and related insourcing of professional services. Reduced legal fees also contributed to the decline, reflecting the settlement of outstanding litigation with Discover in fiscal 2008. Depreciation and amortization decreased during fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of depreciation and amortization for technology and facility in our Colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional depreciation of $13 million in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center. We expect our new east coast data center and office building to generate additional depreciation expense of approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010. Administrative and other remained flat in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. Administrative and other expenses in fiscal 2007 included facilities expense paid to the real estate joint ventures owned by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, which were consolidated as part of Visa Inc. following the reorganization. Litigation provision primarily reflected: (i) $1.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2008 in connection with the Discover settlement, (ii) additional accruals of $285 million made in fiscal 2008 related to covered litigation, and (iii) $1.9 billion related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express in fiscal 2007. All of these matters are covered by the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) Visa Inc.2009 Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ $ 1 $ 40 $ (1 ) $ (39 ) NM (97 )% Interest expense (115 ) (143 ) (81 ) 28 (62 ) (20 )% 77 % Investment income, net 575 211 103 364 108 NM NM Other 2 35 (33 ) 35 (95 )% NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 462 $ 104 $ 62 $ 358 $ 42 NM 67 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 reflected the equity in earnings of Visa International which was acquired in the reorganization. Interest expense decreased in 2009 reflecting lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The increase in 2008 is primarily due to interest accretion related to the American Express settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Investment income, net increased in 2009 primarily due to a pre tax gain of $473 million recognized on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, partially offset by lower interest income earned on both our investments in marketable securities and the portion of our IPO proceeds used to redeem our class C (series II) and class C (series III) common shares in October 2008. Investment income, net in fiscal 2008 also reflected realized losses and other 42 Table of Contents than temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and money market funds. See Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflected the adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. This liability was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate increased to 41% in fiscal 2009, compared with 40% in fiscal 2008 and 23% for Visa U.S.A. in fiscal 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which increased the overall effective tax rate by approximately 1%. Our Singapore subsidiary began operating under a tax incentive agreement in fiscal 2009, which had an insignificant impact on the fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of certain special deductions in California for which we were eligible prior to our IPO, the change in state tax apportionment, and a one time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 to decrease to below 40% due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payment of required litigation settlement payments, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends, to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors, to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Management will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data This table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years: 2009 2008 2007(1) (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 558 $ 531 $ 505 Investing activities 1,830 554 (463 ) Financing activities (2,751 ) 3,624 (37 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 (5 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (362 ) $ 4,704 $ 5 43 Table of Contents (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non cash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million book gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments including litigation and volume and support incentives. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income of $804 million and adjustments for non cash items of $3.1 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations, reflecting the use of $92 million to satisfy payments settlement activities; $115 million of compensation benefit payments net of new accruals; and $217 million of volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals. These uses of cash were offset by deferred taxes payable, depreciation and amortization and other non cash items, as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects $884 million of cash distribution from the Reserve Primary Fund (the Fund), net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008, reflects $1,002 million of cash acquired through the reorganization, $949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were re invested in shorter term cash equivalents and $415 million of property, equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center. In addition, we reclassified our $953 million investment in the Fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually required redemption of our class C (series II) and class C (series III) common shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.8 billion to the litigation Escrow Account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by funding of covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation Escrow Account. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributed to IPO related activities including $19.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock, offset by $13.4 billion used for the partial redemption of class B and class C (series I) common stock, and $3.0 billion payment to the litigation Escrow Account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1.1 billion, reflecting funding of covered litigation payments from the litigation Escrow Account, offset by $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long 44 Table of Contents term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Investment Portfolio. Our investment portfolio primarily comprises of securities which enable us to meet a desired level of liquidity to meet working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds, debt securities issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies and Canadian government debt securities. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Uncertainties in the credit markets have affected a number of these holdings. In September 2008, the Fund was unable to honor our request for the full redemption of our investment totaling $983 million. The Fund was subsequently placed into liquidation and announced that it would distribute funds to investors on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of shares held by each investor. Since the announcement, we have received distributions totaling $903 million, including $19 million received in October of fiscal 2010. We believe that the fund will distribute its remaining assets within twelve months, and have therefore classified our remaining investment of $69 million, which reflects an impairment of $29 million, as a current asset at September 30, 2009. See Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Revolving Credit Facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain of our class B and class C stockholders and certain of our customers and affiliates of our customers. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There have been no borrowings under this facility. At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants with respect to this facility. U.S. Commercial Paper Programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. At September 30, 2009, we had no obligations outstanding under this program. There are no financial covenants related to this program. 45 Table of Contents Universal Shelf Registration Statement. On May 6, 2009 we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. Per the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow Account. We maintain an Escrow Account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the Escrow Account the shares of class B common stock held by our shareholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2009 was $1.7 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet ($1.4 billion in current assets and $350 million in long term assets). As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2009, Standard and Poors and Moodys rated our unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including, changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments Settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. Covered Litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As part of the Plan, we deposited $3.0 billion of our IPO proceeds into an Escrow Account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be paid. During fiscal 2009, we deposited an additional $1.8 billion into the Escrow Account. Under the Plan, when the Company funds the Escrow Account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to the shares of class A common stock. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial 46 Table of Contents statements. In fiscal 2009 we made $2.0 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the Escrow Account. Other Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our retailers litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement (the Prepayment Agreement) to modify our remaining payment obligations under the original retailers litigation settlement agreement. Pursuant to the Prepayment Agreement, on October 5, 2009 we made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation. Redemption of Stock. In fiscal 2008, we redeemed 154,738,487 shares of class B common stock for $6.6 billion and 159,657,751 shares of our class C (series I) common stock for $6.8 billion. In fiscal 2009 we completed the redemption of 79,748,857 shares of our class C (series II) common stock and 35,263,585 shares of our class C (series III) common stock held by Visa Europe for $2.6 billion, less dividends and certain other adjustments. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2010 and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. Dividends. During fiscal 2009, we paid $318 million in dividends. On October 20, 2009, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.125 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $93 million in connection with this dividend in December 2009. See Note 15 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the dividend declarations. We intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors, at an annual rate equal to $0.50 per share of class A common stock. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe Put Option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple (the P/E ratio) at the time the option is exercised (as defined in the option agreement) to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12 month period (adjusted sustainable income). Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income is calculated under the terms of the put option agreement and includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the put option liability was $346 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as determined at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $75 million of adjusted 47 Table of Contents sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below for illustrative purposes only is based on Visa Europes financial results for the year ended September 30, 2008. However, this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2008 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2009, our estimated long term P/E ratio was 22.0 and the P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 4.5x as compared to the estimated long term differential of 5.3x we used to value the put option. However these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were to be exercised at any point in the future. Visa Incs Forward Price to Earnings Ratio Payout Assuming Adjusted Projected Sustainable Net Operating Income of $75 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Sustainable Net Income Above/Below $75 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $1,875 $625 20 $1,500 $500 15 $1,125 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and employees final three to five years of earnings, as well as a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and for Visa U.S.A. in fiscal 2007, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $170 million, $190 million and $65 million, respectively. In fiscal 2010, we intend to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $70 million. Capital Expenditures. During fiscal 2009, we completed the construction of a new data center on the east coast of the United States. Upon completion in March 2009, we migrated our current east coast data center to this new facility. The new data center is intended to support our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 we incurred total costs of $156 million, $241 million and $23 million, respectively related to the construction of this new data center. We will continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure, some of which we treat as capital expenditures. Other Uses. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2009, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $56 million. 48 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2009, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.3 billion of assets, of which $34 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non binding market consensus prices or the non binding broker quotes. Marketable debt instruments in this category include corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, other asset backed securities and auction rate securities. See Note 5 Investments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are comprised of guarantees. Visa has no off balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2009. We indemnify customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is unlimited. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require customers to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other customers under which we may agree to indemnify the customer for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2009. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and 49 Table of Contents available credit facilities. See Note 3 Visa Europe, Note 10 Debt, Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents non cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from less than one year to eight years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. (5) Included dividend amount of $93 million as dividends were declared on October 20, 2009 and will be paid on December 1, 2009 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 16, 2009. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $397 million, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of state and foreign income taxes. At September 30, 2009, we also accrued $22 million of interest and $5 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $346 million at September 30, 2009 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition Volume and Support Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are based on fixed payments and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are met. The deferability criteria includes the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our customers. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our customers actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2009, performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1% of our total operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option under which we are required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, as defined in the agreement, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12 month period. See Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option, which under certain conditions could obligate us to purchase its members equity interests for an amount greater than fair value, was determined to be 51 Table of Contents approximately $346 million at September 30, 2009. While the put option is in fact non transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction. Our valuation methodology involves using probability weighted models designed to estimate the present value of our liability assuming various possible exercise decisions that Visa Europe could make, including the possibility it will never exercise its option, under different economic conditions in the future. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option, and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its articles of association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over both the shorter of the preceding 24 months or since our IPO (the long term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30 day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30 day P/E calculation as compared to the long term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in long term value of the Company or the result of short term market volatility or other non Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicators, as opposed to short term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of the future earnings of Visa Inc. and the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes projected sustainable adjusted net operating income. 52 Table of Contents The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from euros to U.S. dollars reflects our estimate of long term exchange rates and is determined based on forward foreign exchange rates available in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. The put option became exercisable during fiscal 2009. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2009. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our brand and customer relationships intangible assets have indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to one reporting unit, which is the level in which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. Review of impairment is completed annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Impairment testing for intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or asset group and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value is less than the carrying value. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that 53 Table of Contents goodwill. Management relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. No impairment of our intangible assets or goodwill exists as of our July 1, 2009 annual assessment, and no events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization among other factors. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets was $21.1 billion, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets at September 30, 2009. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding to which we are a party. We record a liability for claims and legal proceedings when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. 54 Table of Contents Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended FASB ASC 260 10 to address whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method. The amendment requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. We will adopt this amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This change will not result in any impact to fiscal 2009 and 2008 full year diluted class A net income per share. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency rates, interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis, and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are related primarily to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues that are derived from foreign currency denominated transactions, and to adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for costs and expenses at our non U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedges exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. In fiscal 2009, we implemented a rolling hedge strategy program, which we anticipate utilizing going forward. Under this strategy, we seek to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $742 million and $4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008. The aggregate notional amount of $742 million outstanding at September 30, 2009 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of $61 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2009. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with customers relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 55 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were $176 million and $403 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $3 million at September 30, 2009. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $34 million and $103 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates would have impacted the fair value of these notes by approximately $2 million at September 30, 2009. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2009. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Assets Risk Our total defined benefit pension plan assets were $703 million and $624 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Although these assets are not included in our financial statements, a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets could result in increases to our pension liability and a reduction to stockholders equity due to an increase in the underfunded status of the plan, increases in pension expense due to a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets, and increases in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2010, which we expect to make in September 2010.
