Inc., the accounting acquirer in the reorganization. (2) Visa U.S.A. Inc. was a non stock corporation and therefore no comparable metric for earnings per share is provided for fiscal 2007 and 2006. (3) Effective October 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the calculation of earnings per share, which requires retrospective application to earnings per share for fiscal 2009 and 2008. See Note 17 Earnings Per Share to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. (4) The long term portion of Visa U.S.A. debt was classified as being due within one year at September 30, 2007 because Visa U.S.A. was in default of certain financial performance covenants as a result of the American Express settlement in fiscal 2007 as described in Note 22 Legal Matters to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. (5) Effective October 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard which requires the presentation of non controlling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be included in total equity. The change in presentation has been applied to prior year comparable periods. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. We provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We continue to monitor the progress of the global economic recovery, which has shown signs of slow but gradual improvement. We expect consumer and commercial spending, and our payments volume to continue to increase in the near term if the economic recovery maintains momentum. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the U.S. in July 2010 includes provisions that will establish regulation and oversight of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices in the U.S. While the legislation does not directly regulate the network fees we charge, except to ensure that fees are not used to evade the new regulation of interchange rates, it may give retailers greater ability to route debit transactions onto competitive networks, which can reduce the processing fees we currently earn on debit transactions. Because the implementation details for this new legislation will be determined over the next year, the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements is unknown at this time. However, we expect to see the impacts of the legislation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Other regulatory measures previously enacted in the U.S. became effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. These regulatory measures primarily impacted our clients, but have not resulted in any notable impact to our payments volumes. We continue to believe that our broad platform of payment products provides substantial value to both retailers and consumers, and that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency, will buffer the impacts of our current regulatory environment, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, and in particular payments volume growth outside the U.S. Funding of the litigation escrow account. During May 2010 and subsequently in October 2010, after our fiscal year end, we deposited $500 million and $800 million, respectively, into the escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan. Under the terms of the plan, when Visa funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock retained by our 41 Table of Contents U.S. clients and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. On an as converted basis, funding of the escrow account had the effect of our repurchasing approximately 7 million shares and 11 million shares of class A common stock, respectively. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Share repurchase plan. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. As of September 30, 2010, we have drawn on the entire $1.0 billion authorized amount by repurchasing a total of 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock at an average price of $77.48 per share. In October 2010, subsequent to our fiscal year end, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan, which will be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. Expansion of our eCommerce capabilities. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants, at a price of $26.00 per share. The total purchase consideration was approximately $2.0 billion, paid with cash on hand. The acquisition of CyberSource will expand our online payment, fraud and security management capabilities and is expected to accelerate our growth in the eCommerce category. The results of CyberSource are included in our results from the acquisition date. See Note 6 CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. The growth in nominal payments volume in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, in particular credit and debit, was primarily driven by growth outside the U.S. Comparing fiscal 2009 with fiscal 2008, nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products, which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year over year nominal payments volume impact. The number of processed transactions continues to increase reflecting the continued shift to electronic payments globally. The payments volume and processed transactions tables presented below do not include CyberSource volumes and transactions. CyberSource activities primarily contribute to our data processing revenues, which is discussed below in Results of Operations. 42 Table of Contents This table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1): U.S.A.

Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. (2) Includes prepaid volume. (3) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our clients, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2010, September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 were based on payments volume reported by our clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. 43 Table of Contents This table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the following fiscal periods: 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009% Change 2009 vs. 2008% Change (in millions) Total processed transactions 45,411 39,885 36,956 14 % 8 % Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. Data processing revenues also include revenues earned for transactions processed by CyberSources online payment gateway. International transaction revenues are assessed to clients on transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement and fees from cardholder services and licensing and certification. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Volume and support incentives represent contracts with clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, stock based compensation, incentives, fringe benefits and contractor expense. 44 Table of Contents Network, EDP and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional and consulting fees consists of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, and the incremental basis in technology and other assets, including finite lived intangible assets, acquired in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource. The incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization was fully depreciated and amortized at September 30, 2010. Administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost method investments. Other non operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Also included in this amount is the change in the fair value of the liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was fully discharged in October 2008. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) U.S. operating revenues $ 4,718 $ 4,023 $ 3,664 $ 695 $ 359 17 % 10 % Rest of world operating revenues 3,137 2,669 2,378 468 291 18 % 12 % Visa Europe operating revenues 210 219 221 (9 ) (2 ) (4 )% (1 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 1,154 $ 648 17 % 10 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. 45 Table of Contents Growth in operating revenues primarily reflects an increase in nominal payments volume, continued growth of processed transactions and the impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to volume and support incentives. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as part of the overall global economic recovery, and evaluate the potential impacts to operating revenues under our current regulatory environment. We may adjust our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Revenues from processing cross border transactions for our clients fluctuate with cross border travel and the extent to which Visa branded products are utilized for travel purposes. Cross border transactions have shown signs of improvement in all geographies during fiscal 2010. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 1% increase in total operating revenues. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. As we are substantially hedged through fiscal 2011, we do not expect any significant impact from currency fluctuations next year. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,497 $ 3,174 $ 3,061 $ 323 $ 113 10 % 4 % Data processing revenues 3,125 2,430 2,073 695 357 29 % 17 % International transaction revenues 2,290 1,916 1,721 374 195 20 % 11 % Other revenues 713 625 569 88 56 14 % 10 % Volume and support incentives (1,560 ) (1,234 ) (1,161 ) (326 ) (73 ) 26 % 6 % Total Operating Revenues $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 1,154 $ 648 17 % 10 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. We expect service revenues to increase in fiscal 2011 as we continue to align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with modest growth of 1% in nominal global payments volume. Data processing revenues increased during fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Data processing 46 Table of Contents revenues also benefitted slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. We do not believe that the current rate of growth in data processing revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth due to the inclusion of these pricing actions, which have largely anniversaried in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. However, we will benefit from the inclusion of a full year CyberSource activity in fiscal 2011. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to 8% growth in the number of transactions processed during the year, combined with other strategic pricing modifications. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross border transaction volume, although economic downturns or other adverse international conditions could hinder this growth. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11% decline in cross border nominal payments volume, primarily due to strategic pricing modifications made after fiscal 2008. Other revenues increased during fiscal 2010, primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We entered into this licensing arrangement with VisaNet do Brasil following its initial public offering and the sale of our equity interest in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase also reflects growth in other new license and royalty fees. Other revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to growth in the Visa Extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform. Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. As anticipated, volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 16% in fiscal 2010. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.0% to 16.5% for the full 2011 fiscal year. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or new contracts. Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts. These incentives were partially offset by the absence of a non recurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008. 47 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,222 $ 1,228 $ 1,314 $ (6 ) $ (86 ) (1 )% (7 )% Network, EDP and communications 425 393 339 32 54 8 % 16 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 964 918 1,016 46 (98 ) 5 % (10 )% Professional and consulting fees 286 268 323 18 (55 ) 7 % (17 )% Depreciation and amortization 265 226 237 39 (11 ) 17 % (5 )% Administrative and other 359 338 332 21 6 7 % 2 % Litigation provision (45 ) 2 1,470 (47 ) (1,468 ) NM NM Total Operating Expenses $ 3,476 $ 3,373 $ 5,031 $ 103 $ (1,658 ) 3 % (33 )% (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Personnel decreased in fiscal 2010, reflecting lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions, combined with reduced contractor fees and employee incentive related costs in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications increased in fiscal 2010 and 2009, reflecting higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. Advertising, marketing and promotion increased in fiscal 2010, due to higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which will not recur in fiscal 2011. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. We continue to review and refine our marketing and advertising spending globally to ensure it is consistent with our growth initiatives. In fiscal 2009, expenses decreased, despite the launch of our global More people go with Visa campaign, reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost. Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in fiscal 2008 in connection with our global reorganization and IPO, and related insourcing of professional services. 48 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition. The increase also reflects charges related to the new east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. We expect associated depreciation and amortization related to CyberSource assets to increase in fiscal 2011, reflecting a full year of charges, or $76 million. This increase will be offset by the absence of $68 million in annual depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis of assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, as those assets became fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of depreciation and amortization for assets in our Colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional depreciation in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center. Administrative and other increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Administrative and other expenses remained flat in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. Litigation provision in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the $41 million pre tax gain recorded as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. The remaining credit balance was due to the release of accruals during fiscal 2010 for certain legal matters. There was no other significant provision activity to offset the credit balance during fiscal 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of litigation provision recorded in connection with the Discover settlement in fiscal 2008. See Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ (7 ) $ $ 1 $ (7 ) $ (1 ) NM NM Interest expense (72 ) (115 ) (143 ) 43 28 (37 )% (20 )% Investment income, net 49 575 211 (526 ) 364 (92 )% NM Other 79 2 35 77 (33 ) NM (95 )% Total Other Income (Expense) $ 49 $ 462 $ 104 $ (413 ) $ 358 (90 )% NM (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2010 and 2009 reflecting lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. 49 Table of Contents Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances, reflecting the use of $1.0 billion to repurchase class A common stock under the share repurchase plan, $682 million to prepay the Retailers litigation and $500 million to fund the litigation escrow account under the retrospective responsibility plan. The increase in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the pre tax gain of $473 million discussed above, partially offset by lower interest income earned from lower investment balances after funding our October 2008 stock redemptions. Other non operating income in fiscal 2010 reflects a non cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax. The change in value does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate decreased to 36% in fiscal 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009 and 40% in fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2010, and the additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends, to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors, to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 50 Table of Contents Cash Flow Data This table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years: 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,691 $ 558 $ 531 Investing activities (1,904 ) 1,830 554 Financing activities (1,542 ) (2,751 ) 3,624 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 5 1 (5 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (750 ) $ (362 ) $ 4,704 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income including non controlling interest of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for volume and support incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation, as further discussed below. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year to date net income and lower litigation settlement payments. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will sufficiently meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income including non controlling interest of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non cash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and volume and support incentives. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income including non controlling interest of $804 million and adjustments for non cash items of $3.1 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations, reflecting the use of cash to satisfy litigation settlement payments and volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities compared to $290 million in the prior year, both of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund, in the current year compared to $884 million of distributions in the prior year as the Fund liquidated. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008 reflects $1.0 billion of cash acquired through the reorganization, $949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were re invested in shorter term cash equivalents and $415 million of property, 51 Table of Contents equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center. In addition, we reclassified our $953 million investment in the Fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, funding of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and $368 million of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually required redemption of certain of our series class C common shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributable to IPO related activities including $19.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock, offset by $13.4 billion used for the partial redemption of class B and class C common stock, and $3.0 billion payment to the litigation escrow account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1.1 billion, reflecting covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account, offset by $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based 52 Table of Contents on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2010. U.S. commercial paper programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2010. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2010 was $1.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, we deposited an additional $800 million into the escrow account. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2010, Standard and Poors and Moodys rated our unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 53 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements, as well as Sources of Liquidity. In fiscal 2010, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our Retailers litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement to prepay our remaining payment obligations under the original Retailers litigation settlement agreement. We made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation in October 2009. Share repurchase plan. During fiscal 2010, we used $1.0 billion to repurchase approximately 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized in October 2009. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan to be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. Dividends. During fiscal 2010, we paid $368 million in dividends. On October 20, 2010, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $107 million in connection with this dividend in December 2010. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to pay quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. 54 Table of Contents At September 30, 2010, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $267 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $75 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below, for illustrative purposes only, is based on Visa Europes forecasted financial results for the year ended September 30, 2010. However, this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2010 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2010, our estimated long term P/E ratio was 18.8 and the long term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 3.5. At September 30, 2010, the spot P/E ratio was 15.7 and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.6. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. Visa Incs Forward Price to Earnings Ratio Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $75 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $75 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $1,875 $625 20 $1,500 $500 15 $1,125 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees will accrue benefits under the cash balance formula and will cease to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are 55 Table of Contents funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $66 million, $170 million and $190 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we anticipate to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $60 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2010 reflecting the completion of our new east coast data center in fiscal 2009. The new data center supports our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million to $275 million in fiscal 2011, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure. Acquisition of CyberSource. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation for approximately $2.0 billion in cash, or $1.8 billion net of cash received. The combination is expected to accelerate the growth of our eCommerce category and enhance the value of our network, product and service offerings to financial institutions, merchants, partners and consumers. See Note 6 CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Other uses. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2010, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $44 million. Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2010, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $5.7 billion of assets, of which $13 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non binding market consensus prices or the non binding broker quotes. At September, 30, 2010, debt instruments in this category included auction rate securities. See Note 5 Investments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements primarily comprise guarantees. Visa has no off balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe and what is now the headquarters for our Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2010. 56 Table of Contents We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is unlimited. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2010. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 3 Visa Europe, Note 11 Debt, Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents future cash payments for volume and support incentive agreements with financial institutions and merchants under various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three years to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain 57 Table of Contents advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes dividend amount of $107 million as dividends were declared on October 20, 2010 and will be paid on December 7, 2010 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 19, 2010. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $443 million, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the corresponding effects of state and foreign income taxes. At September 30, 2010, we also accrued $58 million of interest and $10 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $267 million at September 30, 2010 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition Volume and Support Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with clients, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are based 58 Table of Contents on fixed payments and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are met. The deferability criteria include the existence of future benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2010, performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1% of our total operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option under which, if exercised, we are required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, as defined in the agreement, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option was estimated to be approximately $267 million at September 30, 2010. While the put option is in fact non transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction at the measurement date. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the Put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. 59 Table of Contents Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its articles of association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30 day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30 day P/E calculation as compared to the long term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in long term value of the Company or the result of short term market volatility or other non Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicators, as opposed to short term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of the future earnings of Visa Inc. and the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled 60 Table of Contents scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2010. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires managements judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring CyberSource in July 2010, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years. See Note 6 CyberSource Acquisition and Note 9 Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite lived intangible assets. Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of July 1, 2010, we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is 61 Table of Contents measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2010. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on July 1, 2010, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we completed the CyberSource acquisition on July 21, 2010, which resulted in an additional $1.2 billion in goodwill and established a second reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. Of the $1.2 billion, approximately $0.8 billion was allocated to the second reporting unit. The remainder was allocated to our original reporting unit to reflect the incremental growth and synergy this acquisition will provide to our existing business. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exist as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.4 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets and $595 million of finite lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2010. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2010. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. 62 Table of Contents Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $627 million and $742 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $627 million outstanding at September 30, 2010 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $55 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2010. See Note 14 Derivatives Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. 63 Table of Contents We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were $135 million and $176 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2010. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $13 million and $34 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the debt by approximately $1 million at September 30, 2010. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2010. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risks Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $766 million and $703 million and projected benefit obligations were $743 million and $739 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2011, which we expect to make in September 2011. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 64 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. We provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We continue to monitor the progress of the global economic recovery, which has shown signs of slow but gradual improvement. We expect consumer and commercial spending, and our payments volume to continue to increase in the near term if the economic recovery maintains momentum. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the U.S. in July 2010 includes provisions that will establish regulation and oversight of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices in the U.S. While the legislation does not directly regulate the network fees we charge, except to ensure that fees are not used to evade the new regulation of interchange rates, it may give retailers greater ability to route debit transactions onto competitive networks, which can reduce the processing fees we currently earn on debit transactions. Because the implementation details for this new legislation will be determined over the next year, the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements is unknown at this time. However, we expect to see the impacts of the legislation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Other regulatory measures previously enacted in the U.S. became effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. These regulatory measures primarily impacted our clients, but have not resulted in any notable impact to our payments volumes. We continue to believe that our broad platform of payment products provides substantial value to both retailers and consumers, and that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency, will buffer the impacts of our current regulatory environment, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, and in particular payments volume growth outside the U.S. Funding of the litigation escrow account. During May 2010 and subsequently in October 2010, after our fiscal year end, we deposited $500 million and $800 million, respectively, into the escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan. Under the terms of the plan, when Visa funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock retained by our 41 Table of Contents U.S. clients and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. On an as converted basis, funding of the escrow account had the effect of our repurchasing approximately 7 million shares and 11 million shares of class A common stock, respectively. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Share repurchase plan. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. As of September 30, 2010, we have drawn on the entire $1.0 billion authorized amount by repurchasing a total of 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock at an average price of $77.48 per share. In October 2010, subsequent to our fiscal year end, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan, which will be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. Expansion of our eCommerce capabilities. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants, at a price of $26.00 per share. The total purchase consideration was approximately $2.0 billion, paid with cash on hand. The acquisition of CyberSource will expand our online payment, fraud and security management capabilities and is expected to accelerate our growth in the eCommerce category. The results of CyberSource are included in our results from the acquisition date. See Note 6 CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. The growth in nominal payments volume in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, in particular credit and debit, was primarily driven by growth outside the U.S. Comparing fiscal 2009 with fiscal 2008, nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products, which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year over year nominal payments volume impact. The number of processed transactions continues to increase reflecting the continued shift to electronic payments globally. The payments volume and processed transactions tables presented below do not include CyberSource volumes and transactions. CyberSource activities primarily contribute to our data processing revenues, which is discussed below in Results of Operations. 42 Table of Contents This table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1): U.S.A.

Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. (2) Includes prepaid volume. (3) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our clients, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2010, September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 were based on payments volume reported by our clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. 43 Table of Contents This table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the following fiscal periods: 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009% Change 2009 vs. 2008% Change (in millions) Total processed transactions 45,411 39,885 36,956 14 % 8 % Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. Data processing revenues also include revenues earned for transactions processed by CyberSources online payment gateway. International transaction revenues are assessed to clients on transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement and fees from cardholder services and licensing and certification. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Volume and support incentives represent contracts with clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, stock based compensation, incentives, fringe benefits and contractor expense. 44 Table of Contents Network, EDP and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional and consulting fees consists of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, and the incremental basis in technology and other assets, including finite lived intangible assets, acquired in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource. The incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization was fully depreciated and amortized at September 30, 2010. Administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost method investments. Other non operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Also included in this amount is the change in the fair value of the liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was fully discharged in October 2008. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) U.S. operating revenues $ 4,718 $ 4,023 $ 3,664 $ 695 $ 359 17 % 10 % Rest of world operating revenues 3,137 2,669 2,378 468 291 18 % 12 % Visa Europe operating revenues 210 219 221 (9 ) (2 ) (4 )% (1 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 1,154 $ 648 17 % 10 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. 45 Table of Contents Growth in operating revenues primarily reflects an increase in nominal payments volume, continued growth of processed transactions and the impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to volume and support incentives. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as part of the overall global economic recovery, and evaluate the potential impacts to operating revenues under our current regulatory environment. We may adjust our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Revenues from processing cross border transactions for our clients fluctuate with cross border travel and the extent to which Visa branded products are utilized for travel purposes. Cross border transactions have shown signs of improvement in all geographies during fiscal 2010. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 1% increase in total operating revenues. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. As we are substantially hedged through fiscal 2011, we do not expect any significant impact from currency fluctuations next year. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,497 $ 3,174 $ 3,061 $ 323 $ 113 10 % 4 % Data processing revenues 3,125 2,430 2,073 695 357 29 % 17 % International transaction revenues 2,290 1,916 1,721 374 195 20 % 11 % Other revenues 713 625 569 88 56 14 % 10 % Volume and support incentives (1,560 ) (1,234 ) (1,161 ) (326 ) (73 ) 26 % 6 % Total Operating Revenues $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 1,154 $ 648 17 % 10 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. We expect service revenues to increase in fiscal 2011 as we continue to align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with modest growth of 1% in nominal global payments volume. Data processing revenues increased during fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Data processing 46 Table of Contents revenues also benefitted slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. We do not believe that the current rate of growth in data processing revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth due to the inclusion of these pricing actions, which have largely anniversaried in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. However, we will benefit from the inclusion of a full year CyberSource activity in fiscal 2011. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to 8% growth in the number of transactions processed during the year, combined with other strategic pricing modifications. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross border transaction volume, although economic downturns or other adverse international conditions could hinder this growth. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11% decline in cross border nominal payments volume, primarily due to strategic pricing modifications made after fiscal 2008. Other revenues increased during fiscal 2010, primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We entered into this licensing arrangement with VisaNet do Brasil following its initial public offering and the sale of our equity interest in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase also reflects growth in other new license and royalty fees. Other revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to growth in the Visa Extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform. Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. As anticipated, volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 16% in fiscal 2010. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.0% to 16.5% for the full 2011 fiscal year. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or new contracts. Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts. These incentives were partially offset by the absence of a non recurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008. 47 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,222 $ 1,228 $ 1,314 $ (6 ) $ (86 ) (1 )% (7 )% Network, EDP and communications 425 393 339 32 54 8 % 16 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 964 918 1,016 46 (98 ) 5 % (10 )% Professional and consulting fees 286 268 323 18 (55 ) 7 % (17 )% Depreciation and amortization 265 226 237 39 (11 ) 17 % (5 )% Administrative and other 359 338 332 21 6 7 % 2 % Litigation provision (45 ) 2 1,470 (47 ) (1,468 ) NM NM Total Operating Expenses $ 3,476 $ 3,373 $ 5,031 $ 103 $ (1,658 ) 3 % (33 )% (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Personnel decreased in fiscal 2010, reflecting lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions, combined with reduced contractor fees and employee incentive related costs in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications increased in fiscal 2010 and 2009, reflecting higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. Advertising, marketing and promotion increased in fiscal 2010, due to higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which will not recur in fiscal 2011. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. We continue to review and refine our marketing and advertising spending globally to ensure it is consistent with our growth initiatives. In fiscal 2009, expenses decreased, despite the launch of our global More people go with Visa campaign, reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost. Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in fiscal 2008 in connection with our global reorganization and IPO, and related insourcing of professional services. 48 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition. The increase also reflects charges related to the new east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. We expect associated depreciation and amortization related to CyberSource assets to increase in fiscal 2011, reflecting a full year of charges, or $76 million. This increase will be offset by the absence of $68 million in annual depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis of assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, as those assets became fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of depreciation and amortization for assets in our Colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional depreciation in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center. Administrative and other increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Administrative and other expenses remained flat in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. Litigation provision in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the $41 million pre tax gain recorded as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. The remaining credit balance was due to the release of accruals during fiscal 2010 for certain legal matters. There was no other significant provision activity to offset the credit balance during fiscal 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of litigation provision recorded in connection with the Discover settlement in fiscal 2008. See Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ (7 ) $ $ 1 $ (7 ) $ (1 ) NM NM Interest expense (72 ) (115 ) (143 ) 43 28 (37 )% (20 )% Investment income, net 49 575 211 (526 ) 364 (92 )% NM Other 79 2 35 77 (33 ) NM (95 )% Total Other Income (Expense) $ 49 $ 462 $ 104 $ (413 ) $ 358 (90 )% NM (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2010 and 2009 reflecting lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. 49 Table of Contents Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances, reflecting the use of $1.0 billion to repurchase class A common stock under the share repurchase plan, $682 million to prepay the Retailers litigation and $500 million to fund the litigation escrow account under the retrospective responsibility plan. The increase in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the pre tax gain of $473 million discussed above, partially offset by lower interest income earned from lower investment balances after funding our October 2008 stock redemptions. Other non operating income in fiscal 2010 reflects a non cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax. The change in value does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. Other non operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate decreased to 36% in fiscal 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009 and 40% in fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2010, and the additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends, to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors, to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 50 Table of Contents Cash Flow Data This table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years: 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,691 $ 558 $ 531 Investing activities (1,904 ) 1,830 554 Financing activities (1,542 ) (2,751 ) 3,624 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 5 1 (5 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (750 ) $ (362 ) $ 4,704 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income including non controlling interest of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for volume and support incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation, as further discussed below. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year to date net income and lower litigation settlement payments. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will sufficiently meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income including non controlling interest of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non cash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and volume and support incentives. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income including non controlling interest of $804 million and adjustments for non cash items of $3.1 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations, reflecting the use of cash to satisfy litigation settlement payments and volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities compared to $290 million in the prior year, both of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund, in the current year compared to $884 million of distributions in the prior year as the Fund liquidated. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008 reflects $1.0 billion of cash acquired through the reorganization, $949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were re invested in shorter term cash equivalents and $415 million of property, 51 Table of Contents equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center. In addition, we reclassified our $953 million investment in the Fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 7 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, funding of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and $368 million of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually required redemption of certain of our series class C common shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributable to IPO related activities including $19.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock, offset by $13.4 billion used for the partial redemption of class B and class C common stock, and $3.0 billion payment to the litigation escrow account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1.1 billion, reflecting covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account, offset by $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based 52 Table of Contents on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2010. U.S. commercial paper programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2010. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2010 was $1.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, we deposited an additional $800 million into the escrow account. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2010, Standard and Poors and Moodys rated our unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 53 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements, as well as Sources of Liquidity. In fiscal 2010, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our Retailers litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement to prepay our remaining payment obligations under the original Retailers litigation settlement agreement. We made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation in October 2009. Share repurchase plan. During fiscal 2010, we used $1.0 billion to repurchase approximately 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized in October 2009. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan to be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. Dividends. During fiscal 2010, we paid $368 million in dividends. On October 20, 2010, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $107 million in connection with this dividend in December 2010. See Note 16 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to pay quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. 54 Table of Contents At September 30, 2010, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $267 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $75 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below, for illustrative purposes only, is based on Visa Europes forecasted financial results for the year ended September 30, 2010. However, this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2010 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2010, our estimated long term P/E ratio was 18.8 and the long term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 3.5. At September 30, 2010, the spot P/E ratio was 15.7 and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.6. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. Visa Incs Forward Price to Earnings Ratio Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $75 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $75 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $1,875 $625 20 $1,500 $500 15 $1,125 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees will accrue benefits under the cash balance formula and will cease to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are 55 Table of Contents funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $66 million, $170 million and $190 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we anticipate to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $60 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2010 reflecting the completion of our new east coast data center in fiscal 2009. The new data center supports our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million to $275 million in fiscal 2011, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure. Acquisition of CyberSource. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation for approximately $2.0 billion in cash, or $1.8 billion net of cash received. The combination is expected to accelerate the growth of our eCommerce category and enhance the value of our network, product and service offerings to financial institutions, merchants, partners and consumers. See Note 6 CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Other uses. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2010, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $44 million. Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2010, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $5.7 billion of assets, of which $13 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non binding market consensus prices or the non binding broker quotes. At September, 30, 2010, debt instruments in this category included auction rate securities. See Note 5 Investments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements primarily comprise guarantees. Visa has no off balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe and what is now the headquarters for our Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2010. 56 Table of Contents We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is unlimited. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2010. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 3 Visa Europe, Note 11 Debt, Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents future cash payments for volume and support incentive agreements with financial institutions and merchants under various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three years to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain 57 Table of Contents advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes dividend amount of $107 million as dividends were declared on October 20, 2010 and will be paid on December 7, 2010 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 19, 2010. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $443 million, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the corresponding effects of state and foreign income taxes. At September 30, 2010, we also accrued $58 million of interest and $10 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $267 million at September 30, 2010 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 12 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition Volume and Support Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with clients, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are based 58 Table of Contents on fixed payments and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are met. The deferability criteria include the existence of future benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2010, performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1% of our total operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option under which, if exercised, we are required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, as defined in the agreement, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 3 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option was estimated to be approximately $267 million at September 30, 2010. While the put option is in fact non transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction at the measurement date. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the Put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. 59 Table of Contents Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its articles of association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30 day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30 day P/E calculation as compared to the long term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in long term value of the Company or the result of short term market volatility or other non Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicators, as opposed to short term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of the future earnings of Visa Inc. and the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled 60 Table of Contents scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2010. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires managements judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring CyberSource in July 2010, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years. See Note 6 CyberSource Acquisition and Note 9 Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite lived intangible assets. Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of July 1, 2010, we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is 61 Table of Contents measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2010. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on July 1, 2010, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we completed the CyberSource acquisition on July 21, 2010, which resulted in an additional $1.2 billion in goodwill and established a second reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. Of the $1.2 billion, approximately $0.8 billion was allocated to the second reporting unit. The remainder was allocated to our original reporting unit to reflect the incremental growth and synergy this acquisition will provide to our existing business. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exist as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.4 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets and $595 million of finite lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2010. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2010. See Note 4 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. 62 Table of Contents Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 22 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $627 million and $742 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $627 million outstanding at September 30, 2010 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $55 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2010. See Note 14 Derivatives Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. 63 Table of Contents We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were $135 million and $176 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2010. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $13 million and $34 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the debt by approximately $1 million at September 30, 2010. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2010. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risks Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $766 million and $703 million and projected benefit obligations were $743 million and $739 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2011, which we expect to make in September 2011.
